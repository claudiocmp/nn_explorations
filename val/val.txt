ucket list.

 (chuckles) Homer, Marge, we have a favor to ask.

 Too late! You already signed! Oh, wait, there's one more.

 Suckers! Oh, wait, you've got to initial this.

 Checkmate.

 (chuckles) Listen, Homer, we just wanted to know if we could borrow the kids for a weekend at our ski house.

 We thought they could pick out their bedrooms.

 A whole weekend? I don't know.

 Hey, if they can watch them for the rest of their lives, they can certainly do it for a weekend.

 I guess.

 As long as we don't make it a habit.

 Marge, no indulgence of mine ever becomes a habit.

 Do you have to do that in front of people? It helps me write.

  Just the two of us  We can make it if we try  Just the two of us  Just the two of us  Marge, this has been great couples time.

 The one thing people with kids desperately need is no kids.

 Well, at least we have time to get the pets' Christmas presents.

 I don't like the way they just rip the paper off.

 Santa's Little Helper, my ass.

 (gasps) Hmm? (gasps) My God.

 They want to steal our kids.

 No one steals my kids, except me, from that theme park jail that I never told you about, except I guess I just did.

 We're all caught up now.

 Let's go.

 MARGE: It all makes sense now.

 That's why they took our kids so quick.

 Like all childless couples, they troll the beaches waiting for the egg-layers to wander off from their young.

 She's gonna raise three kids without wrecking that perfect figure.

 Oh, yeah, man.

 (groans) Don't worry, Marge.

 We'll get them.

 Unless we die on this icy mountain road.

 Then they've won forever.

 Homie, I just had a horrible thought.

 (chuckles) Women and their horrible thoughts.

 What if they are better for the kids than us? Marge, let me set your mind straight about something.

 That spectacular young couple is definitely better for the kids, but those kids are ours, because we made them by accident.

 And now we're gonna take them back because we love them, especially now that we've had a little time apart from them.

 (crashing, groans) I've got a bone to pick with you.

 Then an apology to make.

 Then we exchange insurance information.

 Then more bone picking.

 Homer, Marge, I understand your anger, but your kids are more awesome than the breaks at Waimea.

 Those better be good breaks.

 Honestly, we fell in love with them, and it just seemed like you guys didn't really want them.

 Sure, you wanted the fun parts, but do you want to go to their little league games and recitals? We totally have.

 Like clockwork.

 Well, I'm glad someone has.

 Look, before anyone says anything else, how could you possibly think you could get our kids? It happens more than you know, Marge.

 I'm a lawyer; he's a surfer.

 That combination's pretty unstoppable.

 BART: Well, I'm afraid that we don't want to be with anyone but Mom and whoever she chooses to be with.

 Portia, you're the woman I dream of becoming, but Mom is my mom.

 Fine, but you're leaving a gap in our lives that can only be filled by foreign travel, sleeping late and gourmet food.

 You guys lock up.

 We're going to Bali.

 (groans) Again.

 We've won! (flatly): Whoo-hoo.

 Kids, your father and I have decided we're not in such a hurry to get you guardians.

 Instead of concentrating on dying, we're going to concentrate on living.

 If you call this living.

 Why, you little (choking, grunting) I do call this living.

 Living the way kids in India can only dream of.

 There is nothing like your biological family.

 (Homer, Lenny and Carl holding single note) (Lenny and Carl coughing) (Homer continues holding note) HOMER: I win.

 LENNY: Win what? HOMER: I forget.

 Shh!   


                





                    			 (panting, gunfire, yelps) (exclaiming) (school bell ringing) (Barney belches) (whistle blows) (yells) (beeping) (playing the blues) (playing the blues) D'oh! (tires screeching) (grunts)  The Szyslaks.

 Already cancelled.

 (sighs) Everything I know about women can be summed up by a jump-rope rhyme: "Girls go to Mars to buy candy bars, boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider.

" Except I didn't have to go to Jupiter to get stupider.

 (clears throat) I had a bigger ball of gas I could study.

 FEMALE GPS: In three-tenths of a mile, make a right turn.

 Homer, listen to the GPS.

 GPS: Turn right Homer, watch the road! onto First Street, head east.

 Not this road, the other road! Ladies, please! You can boss me around, just one at a time! On Main Street, turn right now Our Sunday drive is ruined! Hands at ten and two! MARGE: What are you doing? It said turn left, not right.

 (screaming) BART: Huh? HOMER: Huh? Hmm.

 What the? GPS: Switching to male voice MALE GPS: so you will obey.

 Finally! A supervisor! Oh So the closest thing I had to an adult male role model were the schoolyard bullies.

 Hey, Simpson! I dare you to stick this caterpillar down that girl's dress.

 Can't I just stick it in Skinner's sloppy joe? It would actually be the only meat in said Joe.

 Not everything can be solved with Skinner pranks, Bart.

 Yeah, think outside the Skinner box.

 (laughing) Hey, look, that movie we were in got short-listed for an Oscar.

 KEARNEY: Awesome! (gasps, bullies laugh) Who's that stickin' a fuzzy-wuzzy down my back? Mary Spuckler!  Lady  I'm your knight in shining armor   And I love you.

 I thought you left home to be a star.

 There's a lot of with a voice and a dream.

 I only got work as a hand model.

 Whoa.

 That's your hand? Just the thumb.

 Did you miss me? (moaning) Get out of my face, cootie breath! I did miss you.

 You stink! Come over Saturday.

 I'm gonna have to push you in the mud now.

 Don't you pig-waller me, mister! Do what you must, darlin'.

 (grunts) (laughing) That sure makes up for my dad beating me last night.

 And for my dyslexia.

 (bullies laughing) (doorbell rings) (yawns) Mary? (shrieks) Thank God I wore the underwear with the hole on the side.

 (humming) It's 8:00 in the morning.

 I'm a farm girl.

 I already milked the cows, overcame a bout of prairie madness, and made you some sausage and biscuits.

 Rain is so romantic, don't you think? You get the picture.

 Perfect girl.

 (imitating Woody Allen): So like a schmuck, I treat her like day-old matzo.

 (coughs) (ominous music plays on video game, gunfire) (screams) (screams) BART: Doctors Without Borders, you're now doctors without faces! (monkeys hooting) (laughs) Bart, when are we gonna do girl things, like catch a frog or leg wrestle? Soon, baby, soon.

 Let me just kill Milhouse's character.

 He thinks we're on the same team.

 MILHOUSE: Betrayed again! Mary, could I steal Bart for a minute? Ask his girlfriend, the game.

 Oh, Mary, you know you're the coolest person I've ever hung out with.

 MILHOUSE: Another betrayal! Bart Simpson, I don't know what the future holds for you If you're lucky, me, then this.

 but, Bart, I do know this: you will not do better than Mary Spuckler, so don't ignore her for a stupid video game! Hey, relax.

 She knows she's the apple of the corner of my eye.

 Bart, do you mind if I call my mother? Not at all.

 Mama! Come pick me up, I'm bored! BRANDINE (distantly): You'll have to wait! The mule's takin' a nap! We hope it's a nap.

 (video game gunfire) (clanging) Dinnertime!  Now, let's enjoy the granola bars that city fella gave us in exchange for lettin' him go.

 That'll teach him to try to preserve our folk singing for posterity.

 (scatting) Just wait till my dad hears this at 3:00 a.

m.

 on NPR.

 It'll prove I'm not wasting my life.

 You realize you just ruined the recording.

 (scatting continues) A lot of musical talent in this house.

 But no one blows on a blade of grass like you.

 (playing "Flight of the Bumblebee") Eight more payments and I own this.

 But are you sure there ain't no video game you'd rather be playin'? All eyes on you, baby.

 Well, tell your eye-ears to watch-listen to this!  I used to think I wanted to roam   But there ain't not never no place   None better than home Count the negatives, it all works out.

  They say that home is where the heart is   But for me it's where the Bart is  Now what are you doing? (piglets squealing) I wrote a whole song for you, Bart Simpson.

 Least you could do is pay me full mind.

 I was gonna enter it in a competition.

 !Ay, caramba! Well, you're gonna win, 'cause you've got star quality.

 Like the Hulk in movies other than The Hulk.

 You know what? Every now and then you say the perfect thing.

 (knocking on door) Mary, it's our turn to use the boyfriend room.

 Y'all don't have boyfriends.

 We's gonna practice kissing with this French-Canadian mountain man.

 Pourquoi m'avez-vous amenÃ© ici? He's still wearing leg shackles.

 All men is unpolished stones.

 Ou est le whisky que vous m'avez promis? And then I ran right home to you.

 You did everything great, Bart.

 Then you told me all about it like a true gentleman.

 I can't wait to use your moves on Lisa.

 Ew! On every level, ew! Bart, you have to treat girls like they matter, not like they're a bunch of Milhice.

 What? It's the plural of Milhouse.

 Look it up.

 Listen to your sister, boy.

 What I'm saying applies to you, too, Dad.

 What are you talkin' about? Marge and I are goin' great.

 Homer Simpson! Did you take Maggie to Moe's? It was during Happy Hour.

 Don't you want our baby to be happy? Don't you see? You're taking women for granted.

 And aside from being lumped together and generalized about, it's the one thing all women hate.

 (scoffs) How can something that applies to Bart apply to me? I'm so much older and wiser.

 More like balder and wider.

 Why you little (choking) I'll teach you to say something that sounds similar!  (applauding) Thank you, last contestant.

 Tomorrow we will feature the no-longer racist country comedy of Barry the Satellite TV Guy.

 Isn't it funny how all people are of equal worth? Please do not boycott my line of power tools.

 (laughs) Now all Barry's jokes are about his ex-wife.

 No, they ain't.

 We're back together.

 Then you got no act.

 (chuckles) And now, the winner is (drumroll) Devon Peacock! I can finally get my suspender buckled! (cheering) Looks like we got a feud with the Peacocks now.

 Uh-huh.

 All I care is what you think, Bart.

 (whispers): Compliment her.

 I don't know what she wants.

 What would my heroes say? Slash her face now, Bart.

 Slash it while she least expects it.

 Bart, tell Mary to play the drums the only thing anyone listens to in any band.

 It's hard to pick just one of those.

 Bart, you'd better get your act together.

 And me, too.

 I've gotta get these shirts to the dry cleaners.

 They close at 6:00.

 Bart Simpson, you get out of that gosh-darned fugue state this instant.

 Lift my spirits! Um lifting people's spirits is an interesting topic.

 For centuries, Neanderthal and astronaut alike have enjoyed lifting spirits.

 You're givin' me book report talk.

 Excuse me, I am a Brazilian record producer.

 I concentrate in the rapidly-growing jug band-samba fusion market.

 Oh, my God! Do you know Billy-Bobaloo Skeeter-Rodriguez? Know him? Before he was famous, he kidnapped my mother! Mary, would you like to have dinner with me and my handsome, girl-crazy son tonight? I am the first boy to get my own liquor ad.

 (Latin guitar music plays) Bart, you want to come with us? I need you.

 Mary, we've just been through three hours of music.

 Usually, I only have music one hour a week, and the teacher spends it reading real estate listings for Fire Island.

 I'll see you later, Bart.

 Mary, are you okay? Sure.

 Everything's fine.

 At that moment, I had a vision of every time in my life an angry woman would say "Everything's fine.

" I guess it's just me and the dog.

 (groans) Everything's fine.

 Now.

 (whistling) Melvis? Where's Mary? I brung you regrets from my sister.

 She has been de-avoidably untained.

 (groans) Am I getting dumped? Okay, Bart, maybe you blew it by taking Mary for granted.

 Woman are life's great mystery, along with why do they give you salt and pepper at a Chinese restaurant? But if you want one more shot, I know a date that will turn this mighty Aphrodite into your purple rose of Cairo.

 Those are movies I made.

 It's my oeuvre.

 It sounds dirty, but it's not.

 (speaking in French) (snoring) Everyone's fast asleep.

 It's like my second wedding night, except more walkouts and there were no refunds.

 Gee (couples moaning) Can I see you tomorrow night? Sure, I'll be here with my other boyfriend.

 He's watching us now.

 BOY: Oh, boy.

 Okay, Luann, it's all settled.

 We're gonna ditch Milhouse.

 Bart, I think it's best if we take a break.

 Good idea, I can chuck eggs at the other couples.

 Just hug me, dummy.

 Back pats? This is a breakup.

 You'll be fine.

 There's a pot for every possum.

 Give me another chance.

 I'll be way more attentive to your needs on the seesaw.

 I'll stay down there for as long as you want.

 Sorry, Bart, I'm a hillbilly girl of 13.

 If I'm not married in the next few months, nobody's gonna want me.

 Not even old Joe Clabby.

 Hey, you're a pretty little thing, you are, but ticktock, ticktock.

 Good-bye, Bart.

 Aw, sweetie.

 I told you this would happen if you dated outside the family.

 Mm-mm-mm.

 (groans) Move along, relationship's over.

 (groans) Sure do like forcing people to leave areas.

 Yeah.

 MARGE (inside house): I was the only without a date at Patty's new lady friend's travel bookstore soft opening.

 You told me it was up to me if I wanted to go.

 You should know that me saying I don't care means I couldn't care more.

 I am sick and tired of trying to decode you like you're some kind of human being separate from myself.

 Bart, would you go to your room while your father and I finish our little talk? Little talk? You guys are having a big fight.

 This is the problem with women-- they don't say what they mean until it's too late.

 All right, fine.

 If you boys want it, I'll tell you what I really think.

 Finally, we're getting somewhere.

 You're both in the doghouse, which is misleading 'cause I still like the dog.

 (sighs) Hand me my suitcase, boy.

 When do I get a Krusty suitcase? When you're older.

 So this is where you go when Mom kicks you out? You're saying it like it happens all the time.

 And by the way, the paint's a little faded on my parking spot.

 You call this a platinum club experience? We'll get right on it, Mr.

 Simpson.

 I told you a thousand times, call me Homer.

 Oh, what's this notice on the wall? Standard hotel boilerplate.

 It just says somebody died in this room in the last 72 hours.

 Aw, man, we just missed it.

 (laughs) Oh, it'll happen again, son.

 Um, I've got to make a phone call.

 Eh, knock yourself out.

 D'oh! Not again.

 (touch tones beeping) Mary? Ooh, that's odd.

 I thought I was calling the Suicide Not Line, because I'm doing great.

 So, um, how are you handling taking a break? Great.

 Turns out Adele was right.

 Ain't nothing better for songwriting than when your relationship takes a bolt to the brain.

 Tell me what you think.

  I broke up with a fella (samba rhythm plays)  But I ain't grieving  He was much too proud  Of underachieving  I can't believe I liked him  I must have been blind  He wasn't so smart or handsome   Or kind  Every moment with that boy  Was totally horrid  And I can't even tell where his hair meets his forehead  Why did I buy her that rhyming dictionary?  My eyes are wide open  Now I see his warts  I wish him well, down in hell   Where he'll eat his own shorts.

  It just poured out of me like venom from a snake.

 (groans) I had this idea years ago, but your mother wouldn't let me do it.

 shows how much she (muffled yelling) It's hurting my eyes! (gasps) It's so great here-- no wife to get mad at you for closing your laptop whenever they walk into the room.

 Or getting your kid hooked on pot.

 She's my kid, too, you know.

 You know what we need? A classic "kicked out of the house" party.

 Now, who's got a rocking CD? I've got the audio book of Robert Caro's The Passage of Power.

 That's it? Well, then let's "power" this party up.

 ROBERT CARO: Air Force One, the president's plane, is divided behind the crew's cockpit into three compartments.

 In the first of them, just behind the cockpit, women sat weeping and Secret Service agents were trying to hold back tears.

 "You've heard of strong men crying? Well, we had it there that day," recalls a reporter.

 As the pilot lifted the big jet off the Dallas runway, in a climb so steep that to a man I miss Mary.

 I miss Roxie.

 That's the club where I used to smoke pot with my kid.

 This calls for decisive action.

 Like LBJ's use of the period of mourning following the assassination to push through the Civil Rights Act.

 But how do we figure out what to do? The same way Hollywood does.

 By watching British movies.

 (people clamoring on video) (gavel bangs) The Prime Minister, that is to say, I would like to make an emergency declaration of love to my poor but cheeky secretary.

 What, me? Eliza Commonbottom? I that is to say Flibberty-gibberty.

  Ah (Parliament cheering)  All the young dudes  Hey, dudes  Carry the news  Oh, yeah  Boogaloo dudes Love is more powerful than all my magic.

 Hard to believe that country used to rule anything.

 Agreed, but to win back our women, we need to make a grand romantic gesture.

 OTHERS: Hear, hear.

 After we finish watching the movie.

  Carry the news  All the young dudes  Carry the news  Let's hear the news, come on.

  Hmm, cursive.

 "You are invited to a grand gesture"? Ooh.

 (orchestra playing "Ode to Joy")  I wrote this song to say I'm sorry   Dad, don't be a credit hog   The melody is by Beethoven   Not bad for a movie dog   I'll stop eating from the garbage   Marge, you will get the last pork chop  Oh (all giggling, cooing) A completed chore list.

 And I promise to do the things I checked off within a year.

 (swooning sigh)  Spuckler Mary, please forgive me   All I ask is one more chance.

  Bart, you're a good duck, but we wouldn't last.

 But I'm the main guy in this story.

 Things are supposed to work out for me.

 Everyone is the main guy in their own story.

 My friend, welcome to my story.

  And that's when I learned Cupid was just a fat, naked jerk with an arrow.

 But surely you didn't give up on love after just one setback? Love is our only defense against the abyss in this meaningless universe.

 Love-- what is it? What does it mean? How do you spell it? No one knows.

 Fortunately there is a cure.

 Any video game ever made.

 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE: Remember, this game is for age 14 or under.

 If you are older than that, please get help.

 Get help, get help.

 Married? (groans) (gasps) MALE COMPUTER VOICE: One message received from The widow Mary Spuckler.

 Whoo-hoo! Well done, Bart.

 You played that like a combination of Willie Mays and Paul CÃ©zanne.

 Who are you? I you know, I-I played the ant in Antz, the lesser known of the ant movies.

 Oh, yeah.

 (Brandine and Cletus scatting)   


                





                    			 Yee-haw! Ew.

 (classical music playing) BART: Dad, what are you watching? I think it's a Terrence Malick movie.

 No, you're watching Baby Poindexter, the most educational DVD available at the checkout aisle at the grocery store.

 Finally, a kid's show that isn't trying to sell you something.

 Which reminds me, we need to order more rectangles.

 FEMALE NARRATOR: Friends.

 (bells jingling) Friends.

 Colleagues.

 (gasps) Don't watch that DVD.

 I threw that away because studies show it doesn't do any good.

 Look at me.

 Maybe instead of watching TV with the kids, you could take them outside.

 What are you doing? This so-called educational DVD may have even stunted the development of the kids who watched it.

 LISA: Wait a minute.

 Didn't Bart and I both watch this thing when we were little? I'm afraid so.

 Well, the obvious question is, why did I turn out so academically superior while Bart While Bart turned out so wonderful in his own way.

 That's the way people talk about Ralph.

 Ralph, whose favorite color is peanut butter.

 I wish I knew what happened.

 (horn honking) (imitates honking horn) But now that I know better, no DVDs for you kids.

 Just educational television.

 NARRATOR: We return to Ice Road Hand-Fishing.

 This has been our way of life since we were pitched the idea by reality show producers.

 Welcome to Thieving Bear Chopper Hunt.

 Okay, no TV at all.

 ALL: What? Honey, this sounds like a noble experiment, but like Prohibition, it will end in a hail of bullets.

 Fine.

 No TV for 24 hours.

 Where'd you pull that crazy number? We can do without TV for a day.

 We're taking Maggie to a children's book store, where she can learn the old-fashioned way.

 The way children did from 1910 to 2002.

 (grunting) Homer, a little help? I'm on it.

 Hmm.

 Hmm.

 If I buy you, why do I need all these books? Shut up, shut up, shut up! Instead of watching TV, we can read children's books written by TV stars.

 Who's Milli Vanilli? I don't know, kid.

 I didn't write this.

 No refunds.

 Look, Maggie, they have a story lady.

 One day, Silly Sally said, "Let's have a sloppy, gloppy supper.

" First, they slurped their soup.

 Slurp, slurp, slurp.

 Then they chewed their bread.

 Chew, chew, chew.

 More soup? Oh, I could slurp this soup forever.

 Slurp, slurp Sorry, folks, she doesn't even work here.

 (grunting) HOMER: "Spot the hidden objects.

" Boy, you're pretty pushy for a book I just met.

 Gotcha.

 (laughing) Candy cane in the umbrella stand: oldest trick in the book.

 Okay, let's see.

 Ah, ah.

 (mutters) Have you seen Lisa and Maggie? If they're not a trumpet or a rolling pin, then no.

 Yip! Homie, help me find them.

 Okay, now to see if I can apply my book knowledge to the real world.

 Got them.

 Wow, no TV for 24 hours? I couldn't get through a day without Doctors Oz, Phil and Gupta.

 You're right.

 I'm bored.

 Epoxy fight! (groans) What the hell is an epoxy fight? Oh.

 Don't worry, I'll clean it up.

 Get me some whip cream and a safety scissors.

 Don't worry, all I need is a cigarette lighter and some sandpaper.

 (sanding) All right, let's just use a razor.

 (gasps) Oh, my God.

 You look just like your dad.

 Let's see how far we can take this.

 And finally the tie.

 I always wanted to wear a necktie.

 Mom says they make you more (in Kirk's voice): of a man.

 Now sing the alphabet song.

 (alternating with each letter):  A-B-C-D-E-F-G  H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O What if we Van Houten to the max? (in Duffman's voice): Whoa, that's a little too tight.

 Oh, yeah.

 Nah, back to the sweet spot.

 Milhouse, if people believe you're a grown-up, we can do anything.

 (in Kirk's voice): Like we go to a movie theater and pay full price? That would be awesome! Okay, first, tone it down.

 Time to teach you to be a man.

 What, now I'm not pulling it off? ("Here Comes Your Man" by Pixies playing)  Here comes your man  Here comes your man  Here comes your man   Here comes your man.

 And put the gas bill on auto-pay.

 Nice.

 Time for your final test.

 (Homer grunting) (computer chiming) Oh, great.

 Another invasive Skype from Mil Huh? Hello, Lisa.

 This is my daddy.

 I mean, um, Kirk Van Houten.

 May I speak to your father, please? He's right here.

 Homer, Bart would like to spend the night at our house, and he has my permission.

 Sure.

 What do I care? Not so fast! Huh? I also want to say that Bart is a remarkable boy, and I disapprove of your fathering and of your fat stomach.

 Oh, well, uh sorry.

 Give him anything he wants-- bigger allowance, a new bike-- just do it.

 Whatever you say, sir.

 Dad, why are you kowtowing to Mr.

 Van Houten? Sometimes it's just so nice to have a man take charge.

 And in ten years, make Lisa go to the prom with Milhouse.

 Dad.

 own-ups have their reasons.

 (aggravated groan) Now, I want you to eat a gallon of ice cream in under two minutes.

 But I just did that.

 You now have one minute, 55 seconds.

 (Bart and Milhouse laugh) I'm going to like being an adult.

 (laughs) (groaning) Now you're the same height as your dad.

 (in normal voice): I can reach the poisons now, each with an inviting skull and crossbones.

 Kirk, you' wearing that shirt I bought you.

 I thought you didn't like it.

 (in Kirk's voice): I love when you buy me clothes.

 You know what's itchy and what's not.

 Oh, Kirk Evelyn Van Houten.

 (humming happily) (in regular voice): I wish my dad could have been here to see my parents kiss.

 Now, did you get Kirk's license? Uh-huh.

 Ay, caramba! I rented a truck.

 I'm driving a truck.

 I crashed a truck.

 I rented another truck.

 Hey, Simpson, don't you have a lame dad of your own? (in Kirk's voice): Uh, I-I'd give you all my money, but my wallet is Velcroed too tight.

 You're the wussiest adult I've ever seen.

 An adult-- he's buying it.

 Kirk, remember, you have the superpowers of a middle-aged man.

 Hello, Mr.

 Kirk.

 I want to buy this beer, uh, cigarettes, magazines with boobs and three pairs of sunglasses.

 Polarized.

 I suspect you are buying for underage bullies, but as that is 98% of my business, I say, "Thank you, sir.

 Come again.

" Yo, Bart.

 Your grown-man friend is all right.

 We should start threatening more adults.

 Wouldn't that make us criminals instead of bullies? Let's beat up a philosopher until he gives us the answer.

 Oh, good idea.

 Yeah, I'm in.

 I made my mom happy and got through the bullies without a punch.

 Being an adult is super easy.

 Hmm, hmm hmm.

 (pops, chuckles) You dope.

 It says those are for her pleasure.

 Now it's time for me to live my fantasy with mature themes.

 I'll go behind that curtain a boy but come out a man.

 Hmm, more money for schools.

 That could translate into more homework.

 I know this is highly illegal, but you're not leaving this booth till you punch yes.

 Don't bother screaming for help.

 This is a municipal off-cycle election.

 There's no one for miles.

 (wolf howling) Don't forget your sticker.

 (evil chuckling) Uh, hey, bartender.

 We'd like two milks, and then you can tell us where babies come from.

 Oh, well, in my case, my mom was hit with a voodoo curse.

 I gestated for five years, then I popped out backwards and on fire.

 Really? Oh, yeah, keep my tail right here in this jar.

 (both gasp) Good times.

 Mom, I think Maggie misses TV.

 You know, Mom, I was thinking we could take Maggie downtown.

 The Jazz Hole is featuring a Dizzy Gillespie tribute band.

 (gasps) Their trumpeter has the puffiest cheeks.

 I don't think so.

 The U.

S.

 Embassy has warned people not to go to downtown Springfield.

 I get it.

 Middle child, never do what I want.

 Hmm.

 Okay, I also know of a puppet show.

 Long before the Teutonic slaughters visited upon our people, there was the massacre by Mstislov of Kiev in 1132.

 (screaming) Maybe we should go.

 Nobody leave till every puppet dead.

 Bart, you wanted to show me something? Just one sec.

 Nelson gave me some notes on a prank I'm doing.

 Now, I asked you here because I know a cool grown-up who will take you to that club in the city.

 Really? Who? (in Kirk's voice): Hello, Lisa.

 Milhouse? Milhouse? Who's Milhouse? I mean, he-he's my son.

 Well, Milhouse, you might get past the bouncer at the jazz club, because they're in no position to turn anyone away, but it doesn't matter, 'cause we can't pay for the gas and the cover fee anyway.

 Au contraire, starfish hair.

 The Baby Poindexter Company is being forced to pay a settlement to any parent who had enough misguided love to buy their videos.

 They're not gonna write a check to a couple of kids.

 Then I will be your guys' dad.

 (screams) Thanks, but lowering your voice and standing on paint cans doesn't make you man enough to be my dad.

 HOMER: Marge, can I get a subscription to Highlights magazine? MARGE: Homer, that's for children.

 HOMER: Where does it say that? MARGE: Read the rest of the title.

 HOMER: Highlights for D'oh! (Homer humming) Oh, dang it.

 I lost my other earring.

 Leave it to me.

 Earring.

 Oh.

 Thimble from Monopoly game.

 Wondered where that was.

 $25 casino chip.

 Oh.

 The smallest nesting doll.

 Oh.

 Can you find anything you like in this bed? Just my honey pie.

 Want to split it while we snuggle? Mm-hmm.

 (Homer chewing loudly) MARGE: Now what are you doing? HOMER: Licking the wrapper.

 There you go, one adult and two children one-way downtown.

 Um, as adults, what do we do now? Shake hands? If you like.

 And that's how you do it.

 (chuckles) Now, remember, I can't sit backwards or I get sick.

 Well, if I look at your face, I get sick.

 Young man, apologize to your sister.

 Make me, baldy.

 Why, you little (grunting) (in normal voice): My adulthood! (grunting) I never thought I'd say this, but that is conduct unbecoming of a bus station.

 Where'd your babies go? Your intellect-deadening DVDs turned my brother's brain to jelly.

 Pretty shapes tell me to kill everybody.

 Looks like you're entitled to the full rebate of $19.

95.

 That's all you pay for screwing up a child for life? (in Kirk's voice): Kids, let me handle this.

 Uh, we'd like it in singles and nickels, please.

 Terrific.

 Just need your signature.

 In cursive? "X" is fine.

 In cursive? Oh, it's just enough to get home.

 I'm hungry now.

 Hey, I'm walking on paint cans all day.

 Give me a break.

 Guys, look, free breakfast if we sit through a sales pitch.

 Just remember, Milhouse, do not buy the condo.

 But what if we can't afford not to buy it? Waldo, Waldo, Waldo.

 Homer, Bart said the kids were going to the Van Houtens', but Luann just told me they're supposed to be here.

 They've disappeared.

 We'll get those kids back.

 Because we just bought them new shoes.

 Waldo, Waldo.

 Do you think Lisa went to that jazz club I wouldn't take her to? How many kids will jazz corrupt? (tires squealing) Lap pool and fully-quipped gym with eucalyptus towels.

 Now, let me give you the 14 different apartment configurations.

 The hacienda, the urban oasis, castle in the sky, Connecticut sunset Lady, my stomach's full, and I want to go.

 That's how it works in this country.

 (beeps) If you try to leave, you'll find the doors are locked.

 Well, before our dad signs any contracts, he has a surprise for you.

 Oh, I hope it's that he's single.

 (laughs) I'm single.

 Though, some days, I have a girl buddy on field trips.

 You're a bit of a freak.

 I like that.

 (giggling) You're the adult.

 (grunts) (lock clicks) LISA: Kirk, don't you have something to tell her? Just looking for a casual hookup? Yeah, for my Thomas the Tank Engines.

 Ooh, I love how I don't exactly understand what you're saying.

 Homie, do you see anything? No.

 I'm sorry.

 It's Wait a minute.

 When I said you needed a software update, it was not a criticism.

 We found what we're looking for.

 The kids? Sure, they could be here.

 Who knows? (tires squealing) Ooh, I love how your arms are too short and thin for your legs.

 Just like a crocodile.

 (in Duffman's voice): I'm feeling a strange, refreshing brew of emotions.

 Oh, yeah.

 (grunts) Milhouse? (in normal voice): How'd you know it was me? The top of your head has a 5:00 shadow.

 (gasp) Your hair is growing back.

 Tell me your secret.

 He's ten years old.

 Oh, there's always a catch.

 Is anyone here going to buy a condo? It's going to be yes, but don't rush me.

 And worst of all, you cast my vote.

 Who did you vote for in the nonpartisan judicial election? Williamson.

 No, no, no.

 I'm really sorry, Dad, but I have to say, it was pretty cool having your life.

 You mean that? I'd be happy to wind up just like you.

 I hope you remember that when I can't pay for your college.

 Now, how would you like to go to your own parent-teacher interview while I see a movie? I'd like that.

 Son, promise you will never look like me.

 I sure hope not.

 Why, you little That's not a heart-warming thing to end on!  Here comes your man  Here comes your man  Here comes your man   Here comes your man  Here comes your man  Here comes your man  Here comes your man   Here comes your man.

 Shh!   


                





                    			  HOMER: Do the Homer shake.

   Hmm.

 I can't believe you're reading when there's so much great stuff on TV.

 Hmm, you're right.

 It is the golden age of well-written, brilliantly-acted TV shows.

 (scoffs) Writing is for bathroom walls, and acting is for getting out of DUIs.

 The only reason TV exists is for reality shows about white-trash scuzzbags doing subhuman, made-up jobs.

 Um Oh.

 Ah.

 Eek.

 Yikes.

 Oh.

 Ew.

 Ugh.

 Well Ew.

 Ah.

 Dad! No.

 Ah! Oh.

 Seriously? Ah! (bluesy rock music playing) Ooh, jail music! NARRATOR: When storage lockers are abandoned, we open them up! Our expert bidders face off in the ultimate contest to discover the amazing treasures within.

 This is Storage Battles! I'll give it one marathon.

 I don't care what people say, I am feeling this unit.

 No one feels out a unit like CJ.

 Not Bubba, not Debbie and Danny, no one.

 Mostly worthless junk: family photo albums, home movies, ah, kids' drawings.

 Eh, just some nobody.

 Here we go, here we go.

 Bubble wrap.

 If there's wrap, it ain't crap.

 Bingo! Antique bayonets.

 Oh! I'm talking World War One, Spanish American War.

 Crimea, baby.

 Well, if you found the right buyer on the right day, and he knew nothing about bayonets, you might sell them for possibly $500.

 Definitely $500.

 $500! Five hundy! Five hundaminidos! (chuckles) (humming) High-five me, Marge.

 I want to know what it's for.

 Too late.

 We're gonna get rich off the poor and forgetful.

 And dead people.

 I bet I win a locker full of treasure, like a solid gold bar of silver or Picasso's TV.

 Oh, no, no, no.

 It is I who will be watching Picasso's TV tonight! (both grunting) Looks like you're not the only predatory opportunist in town.

 (gasps) There's other P.

O.

's?! Uh-oh, better put on my game shades.

 Do I hear $50? Let me get $50.

 Oh, yeah! $100.

 Is there $100 out there? Looking for $100.

 Thank you! $150, $150.

 (strums electric guitar) Do I have $200? $250.

 Do I hear (yelling grunt) $350.

 Yarr! Four.

 Do I hear $400? $450.

 Bidding! $500.

 (plays bagpipes) $550.

 Skinner! $600.

 (trumpeting) $650.

 $650 going once, $650 going twice (saxophone playing) $1,000.

 $1,000 going once, going twice.

 Sold to the man who didn't wait for the bidding to get anywhere near $1,000! In the money game, cash is king.

 (chuckles) (harmonica playing bluesy music) We spent $1,000 on a bunch of old boxes? You won't be laughing when these boxes are full of priceless treasures.

 I wasn't laughing, I was being worried.

 (humming) Feather boas? Mine's full of hand mirrors.

 I've got perfume spritzers.

 Makeup and baby oil.

 Tights? Robes? Oh, this stupid locker must have belonged to some old lady.

 "Property of Abraham J.

 Simpson"? This is Grampa's stuff.

 Why would my man-dad have lady stuff? It's not all lady stuff.

 Look at all these fitness publications.

 Beefcake mags? (gasps) I think your dad might be gay.

 Oh, that's insane.

 My dad was married to a woman who left him because he ignored her needs for decades.

 Ah, my gay dad is gay for gays.

 (harmonica playing bluesy music) (groans) I think this is great.

 Old gay men are adorable.

 Like wrinkle dogs in a wrinkle dog calendar.

 Those are pretty cute.

 Your dad's been in the closet for so long, he probably doesn't know how tolerant society's become.

 They even had a gay float in the Pride Parade last year.

 My dad has always been so angry.

 Maybe if we help him be who he is, he'll finally be happy.

 Oh, Homie, you're so enlightened.

 Yeah, gay rights are human rights, baby.

 (humming) Are you sure you're not just doing all this because it's cool to be accepting of a gay family member? Oh, honey, that's just silly.

 This'll show Helen Lovejoy.

 Always bragging about her he-she cousin.

 Abe, we found your storage locker.

 It's okay, Dad.

 We know the truth, and we love you.

 What?! The contents of that locker are my private business! Get out! Just admit who you are, and you can find new love.

 If you don't want to die alone, come out of your room.

 (moaning): Love love love love (all gasping) Hi, Marge.

 I was just taking Stanlerina to get her hormone shots.

 (groans): Oh.

 Your father wasted his whole life being married to your mother and having you.

 We've got to find him a boyfriend before it's too late.

 Why don't you put a personal ad on the Internet? That's how young people date these days.

 It's weird that you don't consider yourself a young person.

 I know.

 It's weird to me, too.

 "Help me out of the closet.

 "Wonderful older man seeks life partner before rapidly-encroaching death.

" No fatties.

 How about some fatties? Fine.

 Okay, post this under "Men Seeking Men.

" But what subheading? Hmm, nothing too serious.

 Here we go, "Casual Encounters.

" Perfect! No pressure.

 I hope someone saw our ad.

 If I can't find my father a man to kiss and cuddle, then I've failed as a son.

 (gasps) Someone's coming.

 Are you "Wrinkled and Romantic"? Huh? What the heck are you talking about, Spectacles? Oh, I've been hung up on someone for years, but I'm trapped in the friend zone.

 (sighs) It's time for me to move on.

 So move on.

 You're blocking the ducks.

 Don't you want to be happy, Abe? Admit who you are, a wonderful gay man.

 (stammers) What?! I don't ride sidesaddle! I'm straight as a submarine! Then how do you explain this? Oh, hello, Smithers.

 (chuckles) Fancy seeing you in Casual Encounter Park.

 (gasps) You're Glamorous Godfrey! Who? Glamorous Godfrey was the most famous wrestler in the world.

 And you are he! Is this true? BURNS: Behold.

 HOMER: Look at all this wrestling crap.

 LISA: Ah.

 BART: Ay, caramba! Fine, I was Glamorous Godfrey.

 (sobbing) What's wrong? I so wanted him to be gay.

 Well, on V.

E.

 Day, I kissed a man by mistake.

 Thank you.

 You were a world-famous wrestler? Spill the beans, old man.

 Word beans! Oh, all right, I'll tell you.

 It was the 1950s.

 HOMER (groans): Oh, those things? GRAMPA: It was the heyday of pro wrestling.

 You could make good money if you were the manly mixture of strong and fat we called beefy.

 Good guys were called "baby faces.

" And bad guys were called "heels.

" I was the king of the heels, Glamorous Godfrey.

 How dare he! That was drinking milk! GRAMPA: My motto was "Always cheat.

" (groans) (groans) But the thing that really drove them crazy was my vanity.

 You are the luckiest people in the world.

 You get to look at me.

 (crowd booing) Grampa, you were the original bad boy.

 Yeah, I was boastful before all your football showboaters, rap music-ers and TV beach Italians.

 But there was a down side to being hated: being hated.

 (crowd booing) (crowd booing) Well, I just couldn't take it.

 Being despised was no way to live.

 Pshaw! Pshaw, I say! Pshaw yourself! Pshaw! Pshaw! Homer, do something! They're killing each other! Oh, yeah? (muffled shouting) The world may have despised Glamorous Godfrey, but that conceited mother-puncher was my hero.

 Please, Abe, let me buy you dinner in exchange for a few tales of the golden age of professional grappling.

 Sorry, I been trying to forget those days for 50 years.

 But, Grampa, I want to hear about old-time wrestling, too.

 Well, it looks like you've made a new fan.

 It'd be a shame to let him down, hmm? Fine.

 One dinner.

 Excellent.

 So we'll take the boy and make a night of it.

 I don't know.

 Should I really let the men who ruined my past and present hang out with the kid who's going to ruin my future? I'll bring you home my dessert.

 Text me the choices.

 BURNS: I can't believe I'm on the town with Glamorous Godfrey himself.

 Tell me of your epic battle with Swedish Olaf Johannsen.

 Oh, yeah, "The Fury of the Fjords.

" (shouting in Swedish) (muffled grunting) (laughs) You settled that Swede's meatballs.

 What I wouldn't give to see Glamorous Godfrey in action once more.

 Would you ever consider throwing your wig back into the ring? Go back to being a villain? Oh, forget that.

 Being hated is the worst feeling there is.

 (chuckles) You've got it all wrong, my friend.

 Once you see it my way, you'll understand that being hated is the greatest feeling in the world.

  Don't really care for chasing women   Never was keen on booze  Don't take cocaine or Mary Jane   No, I get drunk on boos Uh, that's B-O-O-S, not Z-E as before.

 Uh, we get it.

  Because (grunts)  You've got to love to be hated   Find the good in being bad  Oh, the crowd is full of gentlemen   But they've paid to see the cad   Yes, it's a hoot, a kick, a gas   When you're the villain of the show   Once you wear black, you'll never go back   It's a high to be loathed  Chucky, Stalin, Megatron  Eric Cartman, Donkey Kong  Vader, Nader, Simon Legree  Terminators, one, two and three   Iago, Joker, Voldemort  McEnroe on center court  Mr.

 Burns and Skeletor  Keep your good guys, what a snore   When it's your head they wanna sever   And your blood they wanna shed   You know you're gonna live forever   If everybody wants you dead  So listen up, because I'm giving   The best advice you'll ever know   So feel the thrill  I know you will  It's a high to be  Loa  thed! I'll feel like I'll live forever as long as everybody wants me dead.

 Okay, Burns! Glamorous Godfrey will wrestle again! (all gasp) That cocaine I ordered is taking forever! (indistinct chatter) I can't wait to see Grampa kick some ass.

 He's always pretended to be boring, but he's really a straight-up psycho.

 Your grandfather is not psycho.

 The only thing he's "straight-up" is loves you.

 Gorilla Joe, Gorilla Sam, Gorilla Pete, Ook and Eek, the Gorilla Twins.

 Where did Mr.

 Burns dig up all these old wrestlers? Apparently, old folks homes are full of people that used to be things.

 Just like you and me.

 Swear to God.

 Welcome, aficionados of the roped ring, to a thrilling night of senior-on-senior action.

 (grunting) (snoring) (grunting grows weaker) (both snoring) (all snoring) (crowd cheering) Folding chairs! Folding chairs! Can't hit somebody when they're not looking without a folding chair! Can I have one? Can I? Fine.

 Ha! And now our main event.

 In this corner, Baby Face Palooka.

 And entering the ring, America's original vainglorious bastard, Glamorous Godfrey! (crowd booing) (baroque orchestral music playing) (booing continues) (quietly): Yes, feel the hatred.

 It makes you strong, powerful, alive.

 You are the luckiest people in the world! You get to look at me! (booing continues) (crowd coughing) (crowd booing) You show 'em, Godfrey! You're the prettiest old man in the world! Why do you think bad guys are so cool? Why do you still have a thing for Nelson? I'm not! That's ridiculous! I just it's that he, uh He's a rebel, and only I can change him! (clang) (crowd clamoring, booing) (crowd shouting) (booing) It's so sad that Grampa has to cheat instead of relying on his God-given wrestling skills.

 What kind of person revels in disapproval? What kind of person, indeed.

 (baroque orchestral music playing) MILHOUSE: It's the prettiest boy in Springfield, Bart Simpson! (indistinct chatter) What's going on? You are the luckiest people in the world! You get to look at me! (crowd booing) Hey! (grunts) (humming) (coughs) (booing continues) Hey, Simpson, tell your kid to quit showboating.

 I've never seen anyone so full of self-regard! And I've worked with Bob Balaban! (booing continues) Your behavior at that game was unacceptable! You're lucky they gave you your participant trophy! I got one just for watching the game.

 Listen, getting people riled up is what heels do.

 Heel? Oh, no.

 Tell me you're not trying to be like Grampa! Well, sure I am.

 I always thought Grampa was lame, but he's really awesome! Your grandfather is super lame! I mean, if he wasn't a terrible father, what's my excuse for this? (grunting) I know your grandpa seems exciting now, but all that preening and cheating-- those turnbuckle antics are not gonna make him happy.

 (Grampa and Burns sigh) Burnsy, I can't remember the last time I was so happy! You grandson- ruining fiend! Look what your number one fan did at show-and-tell! (Bart giggling) ROBOTIC VOICE: Wait.

 Ow.

 Ah.

 Wait.

 Who would film such a thing? It's found footage! So what? We could use another winner in this family! How are you a winner? You're cheating in a fake sport.

 Fake? Ridiculous.

 If professional wrestling were fake, that would make every fan in the history of the sport a complete and utter moron.

 Mercy.

 You know, I've always had a keen eye for tiny talent.

 Perhaps you and the lad could tag-team up.

 Wrestle with Bart? Well, he ain't beefy, but he is infuriating, and you can't teach infuriating.

 Monty, you're a genius! Bart cannot be an old-time wrestler! As your inattentive son, and your incompetent employee, I forbid it! Oh, why does everything I forbid always happen? (grunts) (indistinct chatter) So, Beautiful, you got your moves memorized? You know it, Glamorous! Eye gouge! Ear bite! Folding chair! Hair pull! Face-fart! Flying face-fart! And then I start fighting dirty.

 (laughs) They're gonna hate you so much.

 Oh, I get it.

 You're here to tell the kid he can't wrestle with his grandpa.

 (grunting) I don't care if Bart is a wrestler, a busboy, or even a stoplight squeegee man, as long as he's a nice person.

 But if he gets too much attention for acting bad, he might turn bad on the inside.

 Eh, that's women-talk.

 Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to comb out my curls! One two three (crowd cheering in distance) Beautiful Bart, can I have your autograph? Sure.

 Here you go.

 (hawks, spits) (laughs) Eh, hey, Bart, leave some of that bad attitude for the ring.

 The world is my ring now.

 (laughing manically) In this corner, for truth and justice, Captain Flag and Half-Mast.

 (crowd cheering) Now entering the ring, the first family of foul play, Glamorous Godfrey and Beautiful Bart! (crowd booing) (sniffing) You all stink! (crowd shouting) Glamorous Godfrey is dead! (all gasp) (crowd murmuring) I am Honest Abe! (all gasp) And this is Laddie Liberty! What are you doing? I ain't a heel no more, I'm a good guy.

 And you're a baby-face.

 But-but what about the cheating? No more cheating.

 And the preening? No more preening.

 But I'm so pretty.

 That's for others to say now.

 What are you doing, Godfrey? You're a villain, not some bullet-brained rail-splitter.

 Without someone to hate, there's no excitement, no thrill.

 I don't care.

 My grandson's soul is at stake.

 How dare you.

 I wrote a song for you.

 When am I ever going to use that again? Curse you, and this morbidly obese little half-wit.

 So, they only want to see a good guy fight a bad guy, eh? (gasps) Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa (crowd gasps) He's taking on Mean Man Monty! Go get him, Honest Abe! This is why we go to everything in this town-- it always pays off.

 (gasps) Honest Abe, can I pin him? Ha-ha! You know it, Laddie Liberty! (grunting) (crowd cheering) Damndest boos I ever heard.

 They're cheering, Grampa.

 This is what I've been missing my whole life.

 (cheering continues) Oh, that was so sweet.

 (sobbing softly) I wish Grampa was my dad.

 Shh!

(gun cocks) (saxophone playing the blues) (gasps) (playing the blues) (shotgun cocks) (all growling) (sighs) Mm? (ice clattering) Hmm? Mmm.

 (all gasp) (kids chattering) Everybody out.

 Everybody in.

 Bathroom break! I spilled my pills! Music today has no melody! (tires screech) Everybody out! Children, you can stop writing letters of support to our troops; that was just busywork.

 Now, I want to explain Miss Hoover's absence.

 She is suffering from severe depression.

 (kids murmuring) Not to worry, she has been treated with heavy doses of Lorazepam and other drugs from the Benzodiazepine family.

 Now, until Miss Hoover returns, this class will be getting a permanent substitute.

 (excited chattering) Please let it be someone smart, motivated, and who won't just teach us corporate-sponsored lessons.

 Lisa, without corporate sponsorship, we wouldn't be able to teach you the three R's: reading, refreshment and Raspberry Buzz Lite.

 Get your razz on! (tires screech outside, kids murmuring) Confident, Vassar sticker on the windshield.

 (gasps) Could it be? Do I detect enthusiasm? She's brought her own orrery! And it's got no Pluto! How cutting edge.

 Please be her, please be her.

 Is this Ms.

 Hoover's class? (quietly): Score! Meet your new teacher, Ms.

 Cantwell.

 Do not call her by the obvious dirty nickname.

 Now I must meet with the new art teacher, Mr.

 Testacleese.

 (snickering) Lisa Simpson.

 Hi.

 As second grade student-faculty liaison, I'd like to welcome you Get back in your seat.

 If I have any apples that need polishing, I'll let you know.

 I understand there are homework assignments.

 Mm.

 Well done, Ralpa.

 If I can't remember the right letter, I just put an "A.

" Well, here's another one.

 Well, while you're grading so generously, here's mine.

 "B.

" As in, "because I say so.

" (gasps) (Lisa groaning) Nothing brings them around like old cafeteria meatballs.

 Meat?! (Lisa groaning) I thought you might be cold, honey, so I put this chinchilla coat on you.

 Fur?! (gasps) (chuckles) It's not really chinchilla.

 I just thought she needed more sleep.

 (doorbell rings) Hey, Flanders.

 Can I borrow some sugar? Sure.

 Uh, a little cream? Goes with the sugar.

 Now if you could make with some bacon and eggs, I'll be on my way.

 (sighs) Why don't you come on in and have breakfast with us? Are your kids gonna be there? Eh, for a little bit.

 (sighs) Okay.

 Homer, you know my parents, Capri and Nedward.

 Hey, hey, Homer J.

 How many beers did you kill today? (laughing) Dad, don't encourage him! Son, you are the Mayor of Dullsville.

 Now, you know we don't discuss politics at the table.

 Hello, police? I'd like to report a buzz-kill in progress.

 There's no emergency here.

 And please charge us for the false report.

 I'm going out for a power walk.

 Whoa, this room just got a whole lot cooler.

 (laughter) (laughs): Oh, man.

 (both sigh) Okay, children, ten minutes of free play.

 (kids chattering) I'm a fun factory.

 Lisa, free play.

 But I am playing.

 I'm hop-scotching from paragraph to paragraph, climbing the monkey bars of plot and theme.

 Ugh, bull-pie.

 You're trying to get ahead of the other children.

 That's it, you're losing joeys.

 Please keep them together.

 If not for me, for the mother.

 (gasps) Is it possible I've met a teacher who doesn't like me? The joeys go in feet first.

 (chuckles) (gasps) Chauncey! (panting) Six miles, and I'm all smiles.

 Whew.

 Funyuns? Little Debbies? (sitar playing) That's cross-legged music.

 (laughter) Look at the size of that bird.

 I'd go Henry VIII on those drumsticks.

 Homer, I can't believe you're partaking with my parents.

 Yeah, it's medicinal.

 We had a pain in our neck.

 (laughter) (laughter continues) (grunts) I didn't know you were left-handed.

 (groans) Homer, you'll need to wear this eye patch for a couple weeks.

 And, uh, you may never see a film in 3-D again.

 (laughs) But the storytelling is finally catching up to the technology.

 Ned Flanders.

 I can't believe you struck my husband.

 Marge, I've been racked with guilt and pain.

 My mustache fell out; this is a clip-on.

 Sorry, Homer.

 Now, do you mind if I pray at your bedside? No, I don't.

 If you pray to Superman.

 (chuckles) Not praying to a character in a comic book.

 What about Christian Archie comics? Neither canonical nor comical.

 Here, I'll get you started.

 Hail Superman, wearing tights, Clark Kent be thy name, one nation, under Zod Not praying to Superman.

 Grouch.

 Ned, Homie's a little cranky right now.

 More than his eye, I think you hurt his feelings.

 Give him one of your famous murmurs, Marge.

 My what? Your famous murmur.

 You know.

 (murmurs) I never made that noise in my life! (murmurs) Thanks, Flanders.

 Punch my eye, destroy my marriage.

 Now just pull the plug and let me die! That's the plug for the light.

 (imitating flatline) (sighs) (yawns) Neddy, I know you feel guilty about coldcocking Homer.

 Please don't use that word in bed.

 (groans) You need to get some sleep.

 (sighs) Dare I take another sleep aid? (sighs) Better not take a full dose.

 Mmm.

 See you in eight hours.

 (snoring) (groaning) (gasping) (screams) (gate creaks) Was this always waiting for me, or was it recently thrown together? That's what I want to know.

 MALE VOICES:  Hey-diddly hell-diddly  Welcome neighborino  Hey-diddly hell-diddly  Welcome neighborino Down here, we worship famous atheist Richard Dawkins, author of The God Delusion! (laughs maniacally) I'm making Catholic saint stew.

 (gasping) (gasps) No, not Surf 'n Murph.

 (screams) The answer to my woe must be in here.

  Whoo  Let's get it on Nope, not that.

 Not to my taste.

 Flag that for later.

 Finally.

 I know what I must do.

 (school bell ringing) (sighs) Ms.

 Cantwell? Yes? Why are you so mean to me? You really want to know? More than I want unicorns to be real.

 Well, if you guess, I'll give you extra credit.

 I remind you of you? Now you've got a demerit.

 This class doesn't give demerits.

 Now it does, and you just got another one.

 What if I homeschool? You're bluffing; I've driven by your home.

 (gasps) Principal Skinner Not now.

 I'm dealing with Mr.

 Testacleese.

 Look, kids can be cruel, Dick.

 NELSON: Ha-ha! (singsong): We don't know when we've gone too far! (growls) "Ann, Mark, Bill and Sally are on the Ferris wheel.

 "Ann is behind Sally.

 Mark is in front of Bill.

 Your precious joeys! (laughs maniacally) (panting) Better switch to social studies.

 "Eleanor Roosevelt became Franklin's eyes and ears and" (gasps) Here's the new deal: you fail! (cackling) (groans) (grunts) Oh! I wish you wouldn't wear sweaters that the senior ladies knit.

 Well, putting my arms in sleeves is about all I got to offer a woman.

 (groans): Oh.

 What's the matter, sweetie? Is a book character having difficulties? I have a bully at school.

 Oh.

 Did you tell the teacher? My bully is my teacher.

 A teacher can't be a bully.

 Oh, they sure can! When I was a boy, teachers would rap my knuckles with a yardstick.

 Now you've got the metric system.

 We don't have the metric system.

 What? This isn't Sweden? And I'm not King Olaf? Oh, I got some explaining to do down at the bank.

 CHALMERS: Skinner! Why am I here? Did this fat boy injure his eye in shop class? That place is a killing field.

 We're here because our daughter is being bullied by your teacher.

 Mrs.

 Simpson, this school does not hire bullies.

 That's right.

 We Quiet, nerd! Well, she's just a substitute.

 Maybe you could transfer Ms.

 Cantwell to another school.

 Nix.

 She's already got two weeks tenure, so she's impossible to dislodge.

 I hate unions.

 There's this guy at my plant, caused three meltdowns, and he still keeps his job.

 Homer, that's you.

 Oh, yeah.

 (chanting): I say, "Union," you say, "Power"! Union! Power.

 Union! Power.

 (quietly): Marge, you're really dogging it on the "power.

" But don't worry.

 Because of the union, you're safe.

 So, just what are you gonna do for our daughter? We should talk about what we're going to promise to do, not what we'll actually do.

 We really appreciate that.

 (murmurs) (bird squawks) Look at those eyes.

 There's an employee with a healthy case of the go-get-'ems.

 (snoring) Hear that lion's roar of determination.

 Homer, Homer, I found the answer! Wha? Huh? Flanders.

 How did you get in here? This place is a highly-sensitive area.

 Who here wants to touch radiation? "Life shall go for life, eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.

" Hey, I don't go to where you work and read the Bible to you.

 I would embrace such a glad visit.

 Just what do you want? I want you to punch me in the eye.

 If you do, then we're even, according to Exodus, Leviticus and Matthew.

 You went and hired a law firm, eh? That's pretty aggressive.

 (sighs) Jeepers creepers, pop my peeper! Come on, man.

 What's the catch? Homer, just call me a little bubble, 'cause I'm on the level.

 Punch me.

 Hmm.

 Come on, Homer.

 I'm insisting on a fisting.

 What's this about a fisting? I'm not punching you, Flanders.

 What? Why? Because if I hit you back, we'll be even.

 But if I don't hit you, that makes me the better man.

 And I'm liking the way that feels.

 No, you can't.

 If I'm not as good as you, then I'm horrible! It's not for me to judge, Ned, because I am the better man! Now, there's no need to Better man, coming through! Way better-better-better! Way better-better-better! Zing! Enough.

 You may be the sweater man, but Homer is the better man.

 Now you're rhyming?! Oh! I didn't know you were left-handed.

 Hello, Lisa.

 I was shocked to hear from Principal Skinner that you and I aren't getting along.

 You should never tell on a bully, Lisa.

 Everyone knows that.

 Lisa Simpson?! In detention? Every rap sheet has a first line.

 What are you in for, murdering Chopin? (laughter) Chopin.

 Can I ask you guys something? Why does someone become a bully? Neglect.

 Abuse.

 I'm a Cubs fan.

 But why would my teacher be a bully? What? Huh? I don't know.

 Your bully's a teacher? That means all of us can be teachers.

 Boo-yah! I'm gonna buy me a Hyundai Elantra! Oh, cool! Whoa! (sighs): Oh.

 Do not cross.

 It is that monster that terrorizes the jolly fat man! Come on, people.

 You're safe as Sunday with me.

 I wouldn't hurt a fly.

 (coughing, gagging) I saw the whole thing! That innocent fly flew from that fresh pile of dog feces right into that monster's mouth! (spits) Fear not, people.

 I will lead you safely across.

 (horn honking) MAN: Idiot! (high-pitched voice): Help me, Flanders.

 (sighs) Never get into Heaven.

 Took harp lessons for nothing.

 ANNOUNCER (over TV): And here comes the tarp.

 The word "tarp," of course, is short for "tarpaulin," which Wikipedia defines as a strong, resilient, water-resistant material.

 That definition is a hit with no errors! What's wrong, sweetie? My teacher's still bullying me.

 Even after we came to school? (sniffles) That just made it worse.

 Oh, every time I try to fix things, it just makes things worse.

 But I'm gonna fix this.

 Uh-huh.

 I think I have an idea.

 Now there's a baby duck paddling around on the tarp.

 You think they move those legs one at a time or both at once? ANNOUNCER 2: Oh, I'd go with one at a time, Vic.

 ANNOUNCER: You know, the great Mel Ott used to raise ducks in Louisiana during the off-season.

 And when a duck got sick, he would take it to bed with him till it got well.

 Mm-hmm.

 (doorbell rings) Flanders, I've come to forgive you.

 Oh, my prayers have been answered! Well, actually, just this one.

 Uh, there is one condition.

 You want to hit me.

 Well, sir, here's a roll of quarters to put in your fist for extra punching power.

 Now, you can shatter my orbital bone.

 That'll knock the wax off my candle.

 Don't want to hit you.

 I want your wife.

 (gasps) To elaborate, I want your wife, the teacher, to help get rid of Lisa's substitute.

 Edna? You know how you said you could help me with any desire, and nothing was forbidden? Well, sir, I want you to rid of Lisa's bully teacher.

 Ooh.

 Well, there's only one way: the nuclear option.

 How much plutonium do you want? Got to warn you, it might take me Ms.

 Cantwell? Yes? I have a new student for your class.

 (demonic voices singing) Yo.

 Yes, this is a very rare mid-year two-grade send-back.

 Something's fishy.

 Are you dating this boy? Right.

 I can't be around him 'cause he's so delicious.

 (laughs) Well, I can't see what harm one kid could do.

 When I come out of this, I'll be a butterfly.

 (lawnmower whirring) I just went to the bathroom for two minutes.

 I know.

 Posted a video online.

 Stupid Lisa, stupid Lisa, stupid Lisa.

 Okay, you've won.

 You've driven me out of this plum substitute teaching job.

 Ms.

 Cantwell, I can make this stop.

 All you have to do is like me.

 I I can't.

 Wait, wait.

 There's no need to leave.

 You showed up before the students; that's all we asked.

 You two are the worst-dressed gay men I've ever met.

 (tires screeching) Ms.

 Cantwell, wait! I've got to know before you leave.

 Why don't you like me? Lisa, sometimes you just don't like a person.

 There's no logical explanation.

 It just is.

 That is so unsatisfying.

 (sighs) Here we go.

 If you don't get what you want, you get all pouty.

 All you pretty girls are the same.

 You think I'm pretty? Right, like you don't get told that every day of your life, with your perfect blonde hair, that Kewpie doll voice that drives the boys crazy.

 And what eight-year-old wears pearls? Bookworms like me can't stand party girls like you.

 She hates me because I'm pretty! (whoops) Not so pretty now, are you? Can you sign my yearbook? I'm glad the only beef between us is this burger.

 Mm, they sure are getting along.

 (laughs) They don't know it, but I slipped a little (whistles) into the brownies I gave them.

 How long has it been since we prayed together, neighbor? This is praying? Let me out of here! (whimpering) (whimpering) Help me, God.

 Shh!   


                





                    			 D'oh! Mm? A plague is sweeping through Springfield.

 A blue bonnet plague.

 Springfield's ladies are wearing colorful Easter hats to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

  I could write a sonnet  About your Easter bonnet  And of the girl I'm taking  To the Easter parade.

 Whoa.

 We'd better get this concert started.

 The giant chocolate bunny's melting.

 Hollow? We paid for solid! Chief, the company's named Bunny Hollow.

 I thought that was where they lived.

 Look at those delightful children, Smithers.

 All those healthy organs, ripe for the harvesting.

 Not here, sir.

 Not now.

 Mm.

 Hmm.

 Uh, not sure what I'm expecting to happen here.

  Here comes flute and piccolos   What comes next, the horns, horns, horns   The horns, horns, horns Blow, you little disappointments! Ah.

 Who could've shoved eggs up our brass? His amusement is tantamount to culpability! Easy, easy.

 Let's not jump to conclus Too late.

 Already jumped.

 Egg don't belong in a chicken's eye.

 It belongs in her pee-poo-birth-hole.

 Kill that boy! It's Easter; why aren't these people at work? Good Lord.

 Look at all these comical booklets.

 Yes, yes.

 Just don't exhale your death breath directly on them.

 Thank you.

 You know, I used to collect these bestapled fables.

 What are you reading? The adventures of The Good Shepherd and his sidekick, The Fleecy Kid.

 Bah! That's his battle cry.

 Baa! The sound which terrifies sheep rustlers the length and breadth of Michigan's untamed upper peninsula.

 You should be out in the fresh air, kicking dogs.

 I'm gonna buy this publishing company and burn it to the ground.

 Why did you have to lock us in? Teach my son a lesson! How much for your entire collection? Um, the speed of light, expressed in dollars.

 Just give him Faraday's Constant.

 Nice going, Bart.

 You've ruined Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter.

 The legendary grand slam.

 You guys, I swear I didn't do it.

 Oh, I don't like the sound of that funeral march.

 Okay, I'll pay for your damn band candy! What was it, $1,700? Forget the candy! We're here to turn this into this.

 Now do me wearing a sombrero.

 Now have me sleeping under a cactus.

 D'oh! Hand over your son, so we can administer "Band Justice.

" I know this looks bad.

 And I admit, I would totally lie in a second to Lisa or Mom or Dad, but I would never lie to Maggie.

 I did not do that prank.

 Wow, he passed the Maggie test.

 And remember how Maggie solved Cookiegate? All too well.

 To prove my brother's innocence, I demand a youth court.

 That's right! Bart must not be judged by these kids, but by a jury, of kids.

 Mostly these kids.

 There's only so many kids.

 I'm afraid once a youth court has been demanded, we are legally obligated to shut down mob rule, as decided in the case of Rubber v.

 Glue and reaffirmed by I Know You Are v.

 What Am I.

 Son, if there's one thing I've learned as a defendant and a juror, it's stay out of the courtroom.

 It's so frickin' boring.

 Run, boy! I'll create a distraction.

 Anyone can conduct Sousa.

 Good news, bad news: we're allowed to select the judge, but it's impossible to find one who doesn't hate you.

 I know someone who would make a great judge.

 Would you kids believe your Grampa once argued in front of the Supreme Court? No.

 Sorry.

 Not a chance.

 I mean, it's true.

 It was back in 1998.

 I say individual rights.

 I say the common good.

 Gentlemen, our system balances both.

 Oh, yeah, and how would you know? Attorney General Janet Reno? That's right.

 And that better not be your gum on the ground.

 Uh, it's not, but I'll take care of it.

 Stop doing that.

 This is better than being a real attorney or a real general.

 The attorney general and I have been playing chess through the mail ever since.

 I find that a little hard to believe.

 Yeah, why would you play chess through the mail when you can play chess through the Internet? Or preferably, not play chess at all? See here, sass mouth, you're not too big for me to tan your hide.

 It's not a threat if I don't know what it means.

 I'll fix your wagon! Thanks.

 I'd like that.

 I get a whiff of the immigrant from these newfangled superheroes.

 Hmm.

 Reclusive millionaire, stately mansion, damaged psyche.

 He's just like me.

 Smithers, I, too, shall become a crime-fighting bat.

 Hmm.

 But I won't become just any bat.

 I shall be the terrifying bat who swoops from the sky and sucks the vital essence of his prey.

 I shall be Fruit Bat Man! Great, great.

 I-I don't suppose you'll be forgetting about this tomorrow? No sooner than I'd forget my own mother.

 That's not your mother, that's your bear.

 Well, then, where's my stuffed mother? All right, you soft-skulled nitwits, sit up straight, because we finally have someone in this school who deserves your respect: former Attorney General Janet Reno.

 Thank you, Gary.

 Grampa's story was true? First, I would like to say, rook to E-8.

 Checkmate.

 Dagnabbit! Youth court is now in session.

 God, I love gaveling.

 Mr.

 Prosecutor? Over the next few days, you're going to hear how the defendant, Bartholomew Simpson, aka the Springfield Egger Objection! Prejudicial! Sustained.

 She sustained me.

 How Bartholomew Simpson wantonly egged this town with Milhouse aforethought.

 Now, hold on.

 Principal Skinner, are you wearing hard-soled shoes on this gym floor? No, ma'am.

 Sneakers.

 You're wearing sneakers to a trial? Oh, God, the press is gonna have a field day with this.

 Yay, field day! I can go cuckoo and no one can stop me! That's exactly what George W.

 Bush said when he was inaugurated.

 People don't remember that.

 This case is going great.

 Although as usual, I look nothing like the courtroom artist's drawing.

 Nice try, Pop.

 Very dramatic, sir.

 A little more brooding, and there's my superhero.

 Now let's get you to bed and Hist.

 Look there.

 This looks like a job for Fruit Bat Man.

 Perhaps we should, uh, just call the police.

 The police? Bah! Every last man on the take.

 And I should know, because I'm on the give.

 I've never felt more alive! Look, I'll give you each $1,000 if you pretend to let that old man out there stop this crime.

 Mm.

 Mm.

 Feel the crumbling fist of justice! Ouchers.

 Oh, dear.

 Who are you, mysterious octogenarian of the night? I am the squeak in the rafters, the flutter in the chimney, the tiny teeth marks in the peach.

 I am Fruit Bat Man.

 Now back to my natural realm, the inky night.

 D'oh! I'll just take one of these key chain penlights.

 You have to keep squeezing this thing? Who has the strength for that? So when I came in, the Monday after Easter, I noticed three dozen eggs missing.

 And do you think this boy took those eggs? Him? All he takes are sodas and desserts.

 Objection! Unhealthy! But could Bart have gotten those eggs? No way.

 They were under lock and key.

 No one could have touched those eggs except me and the seagulls that laid them.

 No further questions.

 Ah, to be young and on trial.

   A toast to our enigmatic new protector, who certainly isn't me.

 Smithers, wink my eye.

 Want to hit the hot tub, Burnsie? Well, I hate to get all pruney, but heated tubbery is what we playboys do.

 Great work, everyone.

 That's a wrap.

 It's nice to make an old man feel good about himself.

 You said it.

 So Bart couldn't have taken the eggs.

 I was with him the whole weekend.

 You'd make up any lie for that Simpson boy, wouldn't you? Yeah, but I'd pee my pants.

 Nelson.

 Dry as a bone.

 Now, that's what I call "legal briefs.

" I thought of the joke and rushed over.

 Your Honor, I think we've seen enough.

 I have demolished the prosecution's claims and made the prosecutor sweat through two shirts.

 I move that you dismiss this case and release this sweet, lovable boy.

 Motion denied.

 Miss Simpson, your grandstanding summation contained a grievous error.

 By calling your brother sweet and lovable, you opened the door to testimony from anyone who doesn't think he's sweet and lovable.

 The prosecution calls everyone in the world! Mr.

 Szyslak, what name did the defendant ask for when he called you at your bar? He asked for, um Mike Rotch.

 And then what did you say? Well, I said, um I said, "Mike Rotch.

" Um, "Mike Rotch.

" And then I I'm sorry.

 Take all the time you need.

 I, uh, I, uh, I yelled out, "Has anybody seen Mike Rotch?" See, they See, they thought I was asking if anybody wanted to see my-my Oh, man, this is so painful.

 My crotch.

 Thank you for your bravery today.

 I just had to make sure that he never did this to another bartender.

 Pass the gravy, Gloria All-Wrong.

 The trial's not over, and gravy is dead animal juice.

 Hmm? Hmm.

 Just remember this: a Simpson never gives up.

 You got to be kidding! A civilian.

 She mustn't know I'm a hero.

 Gouge her eyes out.

 Mr.

 Burns, I came here because my brother is about to be wrongfully convicted, and the man I'm looking for would help me find the truth.

 Don't you get it? I don't care who you are or what you want.

 Now get lost.

 I think you just sent away the first person you could have actually helped.

 What do you mean, "actually"? I've punched out four Homer Simpson shaped burglars tonight alone.

 All those crooks were fakes, set up by me.

 Even the Abominable Dr.

 Lenny? No, he was a happy accident.

 But the rest were fakes, just like you, a man who claims to be a hero but is nothing more than a fraud with a cute little bod.

 They're calling for you, sir, but who's gonna answer? Ah! What the hell is that?! And so I've learned that the only true Batmen are Christian Bale and Adam West.

 Why are you washing Bumblebee Man's pants? I volunteered to wash the egg stains off everyone's clothes.

 It's one of those things you say and hope nobody takes you up on it.

 That's odd.

 What's odd? This skirt has a small splatter.

 Splatter? Splatter as if the egg had been crushed against it by hand.

 I don't follow.

 Like someone faked being hit, so they wouldn't be a suspect.

 Interesting, except you missed one thing.

 What's that? It's not a skirt.

 It's a kilt! Oh, the wood chipper.

 Is there any sweeter music? Why'd you do it, Willy? Because the world is better off with four fewer Welshmen! Wait, what are we talking about? This kilt says you framed my brother.

 Why? Because I hate Easter.

 You see, ladies, I'm not just a Presbyterian, I'm a Scottish Old Believer Presbyterian! Old Believers don't recognize holidays not celebrated by the original apostles, especially one named after the pagan god, Eostre! But how did you get the key? I made sweet love to Lunchlady Dora, then copied the key as she slept.

 Hmm.

 Mm-hmm.

 Now, as for your evidence Behold, the pointed ears of justice.

 Ah! A human fruit bat! You're so light.

 It's like fighting a silk scarf! Or a kimono sash! Yes, feel the weightless tickle of justice.

 Which side won? Good or evil? Good.

 And which side was I on? Also good.

 Well, there's two surprises.

 Will the defendant please rise? It's amazing how much exercise I've gotten from those words.

 Pause the inquisition! Behold the real egg-flinging fiend.

 Aye, 'tis true.

 I pulled the prank, for some daft Scottish reason.

 I'd fire that man if he weren't so damned good at what he does.

 We have a school full of professionals, sir.

 Really? Where is that school? Inside your head? Another mystery solved by Attorney General Janet Reno.

 Case dismissed.

 You saved me, Lis.

 For the rest of my life, you'll always be my one phone call.

 Aw, but I do hope you'll try to be good from now on.

 Don't need to; I got you.

 Children, let me be clear.

 Despite what happened here, last minute confessions, shackled Scotsman and meddling billionaires are not how the legal system works.

 Well, the last one is.

 Today, you were truly a hero.

 Thank you.

 Excellent.

 You know, if you're gonna be a hero, you might not want to tent your fingers like that.

 Is this better? Maybe you should wrap your hands behind your head.

 Maybe I should wrap them around your gabby little throat.

 Ah! Tenting, tenting! Back to the tenting! Acquitted? Then my nightmare isn't over! Well, Fruit Bat Man, it seems you're no match for me, the Abominable Dr.

 Lenny! Gentlemen, this threat is too great for just one elderly hero.

 We have no choice but to activate The Octogenarian Initiative.

 The Rambler And then there was the time I taught a dog to make oatmeal.

 Early Bird, Hot Flash, Iron Lung.

 It is time to pull up The Dependables.

 I open one, no trump.

 Double.

 You've just made a powerful enemy.

 Shh!   


                





                    			  Maybe tomorrow  When he looks down  On every green field  Ooh, ooh   In every town  All of his children  In every nation  There'll be peace and good  Brotherhood What do women want? Throughout their herstory That's right, I said herstory.

 Of plant Earth, men have attempted to answer that question, and failed.

 Or should I say, "maled".

 Ha, ha, ha Keep it under your head guys.

 That I've got a date with a married woman.

 So let me guess.

 Is it Marge? Her husband's gonna be there too.

 Got it.

 You and Marge.

 Give up? It's Marge.

 I'm having a lunch date with my wife Good one.

 Yeah.

 You got us man.

 Ha, ha.

 A date with my wife.

 Yeah, well I got plans for lunch too.

 I'm lying under a tree.

 Hmm.

 Everybody's got something.

 Ooh this is the coolest sushi restaurant in town.

 It got three and a half stars in the Springfield Tire Guide.

 When we got married, I promised you a life full of romance.

 Now here it is.

 Not fresh enough.

 Can we get some soy sauce? We do not recommend soy sauce with that particular roll.

 No soy sauce! You and all your ancestors banned! But-but I but Edamame them away! You really think that's going to get rid of us? How you like this soy sauce? The customer is never right! If they can be that rude, the food must be great.

 I was just leaving a tip.

 Tip included! Oh, Marge, this is amazing! I never realized some restaurants are better than others.

 I hope you are enjoying your sushi.

 It's as yummy as your poorly produced local commercial said.

 I argued against that cowboy hat, but in the end, it worked.

 So, without the kids, we can have sophisticated grown-up talk.

 Oh, yeah.

 Mmm! And I'm thinking of getting Maggie swimming lessons.

 Beats drowning.

 When God rested on the seventh day, did he take a nap or do a hobby he enjoyed? I think I'm interesting! What?! What?! You're interesting! Why would you say that?! Can you chew with your mouth closed? It's like looking into a garbage disposal.

 Words hurt, you know? The most romantic part of this was the hold music when I made the reservation.

 Maybe it's time for a visit from Wally the Kissing Walrus.

 Everything has its breaking point.

 Even the strongest substance in the universe a married mother of three.

 That usually works, but not today.

 Uh-oh.

 Marge, I thought this was an innocuous lunch, but it's become terribly ocuous! Uh, conversation, conversation You look great.

 And, uh, how was your day? Lousy.

 You can't spell "lousy" without "us.

" I'm going to take a cab.

 Marge, wait! Listen, we swore we'd never go to sleep angry at each other.

 I'm not going to sleep.

 Well, you didn't have two beers with your lunch.

 Oh, my God.

 A marriage so perfect that I could take it for granted for years suddenly explodes.

 What do I do? What do I do? For a man confronted with danger, two responses immediately come to mind.

 I like that picture of the sneaker with the wings.

 I'm gonna flee! Where's an electric sidewalk when you need one? Fleeing didn't work.

 I have no choice.

 I will have to do whatever the other thing was! As Homer prepares to fight for his marriage, another battle between the sexes begins on the other side of Springfield.

 Just once, I wish Lisa would get up, come over and sit next to me.

 She's getting up! She's coming over! This is a nightmare! I think our lunches got mixed up.

 Oh, I'm sorry.

 That means I threw yours out.

 But I still have a couple of your mini carrots.

 Mm-hmm.

 What's the matter? Not a vegetarian? Milhouse, got anything good? Sure.

 I've got goulash, schnitzel, salmagundi Ooh, a cupcake.

 Oh, yeah Um do you want it? Mm-hmm.

 I'm gonna give up my cupcake for a second of attention? Isn't there a better way to relate to a girl? Go wash up and help me clear the table.

 Now, that's how I clear the table! He could board my streetcar any time.

 Why doesn't Blanche go for that delightful Karl Malden? Who, Potato Nose? Forget it.

 For some stupid reason, chicks dig Brando.

 Sweaty clothes and mumbling? I've been wasting my time with this sophisticated act.

 Lisa, you can't have my cupcake.

 Wha? You heard me, Duchess.

 It's mine, and I'm saving it.

 Oh, okay.

 If you'll excuse me, I have to go think of you in a different light.

 Great.

 She's never gonna talk to me again.

 I'm sorry I was inconsiderate, Milhouse.

 And furthermore, I respect you more for saying no.

 Tell you what, babe.

 Why don't you get me a milk? Milhouse, where are you going with this? Playing the biggest hunch of my life.

 I just have one thing to say: chocolate or regular? Huh? Why am I doing this? What are you doing, going to Wisconsin for the milk? I've seen cafeteria ketchup move faster! Who knew having a backbone was attractive? Certainly not I.

 It would change the way my suits fit.

 Milhouse, you'll probably think this is lame, but I was gonna go for a nature walk after school, and I thought maybe you'd like to Just start nature-walking.

 See if I show up.

 Milhouse has made his choice, and if there's any justice, he's doomed.

 Now let's see what Maggie's up to.

 Moving on Why are all his laundry-basket shots three point attempts? What are you doing home from work? I'm fighting for you, babe.

 Fighting like I would for the last slice of cold pizza in the box.

 And to show you how serious I am From the gas station? From the place beside the gas station.

 Hmm.

 Well, that does sound good.

 I'll just stick this in your apology card drawer.

 No.

 I'm tired of your broken promises.

 "Marge, I'm gonna lose ten pounds.

" "Sweetie, I'll be home at 8:00 p.

m.

" "Sweetie, I'll be home at 8:00 a.

m.

" "I'll take you out to the most romantic lunch of your life.

" I'm done! Marge was so happy when I made those promises.

 What changed? Milhouse, seeing you there saying nothing it's the cutest you've ever been.

 Uh Hush, sweet boy.

 Let me get lost in the blue of your eyebrows.

 Whatever.

 Did you bring me that sandwich what I sent you out for? It came with fries or salad.

 Whichever you picked, you picked wrong.

 Well, I wasn't sure, so I got both.

 Who knows her little Milhouse? I'm acting like a jerk, and Lisa's eating it up.

 Why don't I feel good? I need advice from the most important woman in my life.

 So everything was going great, and then I wondered if the me she likes is the real me.

 Well, let me say this is the first time you've been brave enough to sit in this office without a bunny in your lap.

 Where is the bunny?! He's in the closet.

 He's fine.

 I'm over here, Milhouse.

 Focus.

 You got to help me, Doc.

 I just don't know what to do.

 Don't worry, I'm here for you, and I'll be here for as long as it takes.

 I'm fired? You're on your own.

 I'll clean out my office immediately.

 I'll show you how to clean out an office! I don't usually say this to kids, but don't be yourself.

 Because yourself is not working.

 Be that guy you just were.

 Gotcha.

 Oh, I love you, Fluffy Fella.

 I just got fired! I need it more than you.

 Fluffy Fella! Fella! Meanwhile, Homer was doing something very difficult for him-- thinking.

 How do I win Marge over? I could get her kids to like me.

 No, that ship has sailed.

 Hmm.

 Fortunately, the modern man has a third alternative.

 Hmm.

 Would it make a woman happy to do the things she asked you to do? I think it would.

 Searchy, where can I find brake fluid? There are 14 Taco Joes in your area.

 That was yesterday.

 "Yesterday" by John Lennon and Paul McCartney.

 Where can I find a better voice-activated search machine? Oh, I can't please any woman.

 Milhouse, I'm not sure why you left me in the forest, so I made cookies.

 But I didn't know what kind you liked, so I made seven kinds.

 I've become my mother.

 Well, common sense never goes out of style.

 That was too easy.

 Lisa! Did you see Marlon Brando in "Mutiny on the Bounty"? No, nobody did.

 Then this is just me.

 Ta-da.

 Bart! Milhouse! Hmm.

 Okay, let's see how straight it is.

 Guess who's coming to dinner.

 What have I told you about comical entrances? Sorry.

 But you never said anything about comical exits.

 Homie, what are you doing? I'm planing down that door that always sticks.

 I put training wheels on Bart's bike, and made an appointment with the dermatologist to see about my slowly receding hairline.

 Oh, Homer.

 Yes, my love? This list is from six years ago.

 Oh, well, you know how, in the Special Olympics, they give medals just for showing up? How many times do I have to tell you to quit comparing our relationship to the Special Olympics? When all is lost, a man's mind turns to one thing and one thing only.

 What fish may I deplete from our oceans for your passing pleasure? Perhaps some shark fin soup? Whale tonsils? Baby dolphin blowhole? Turtle smile? I'd like a lot of food, and for this to be the last decision I have to make.

 Aye, you want omakase-- chef's choice.

 You're all I have left.

 I trust you completely.

 And I you.

 Let me run your credit card to celebrate that trust.

 Okay.

 This should do it.

 Thank you, Mr.

 Franders.

 Lis, you saved us.

 Milhouse, are you okay? Milhouse, for Superman II, I got $5 million for three days work, so don't expect any more free advice from me.

 How about me, Potato Nose? Uh later.

 I see tears in your toro.

 Marriage is so tough.

 Every second, it could explode catastrophically.

 Makes me not want to come home from my job at the nuclear plant.

 I say marriage is like fish.

 There are parts so delicious they could've been sliced from angels and parts we make into omakase.

 Omakase Where have I heard that word before? You haven't-- now, finish your omakase.

 Although we have but one ocean, it offers many special delights.

 Wow.

 Wow, this is the most delicious analogy I've ever eaten.

 I need to share this insight with Marge.

 Put this in your finest Styrofoam.

 Once again, by eating alone, I have saved my marriage.

 Please enjoy, with my compliments.

 You can even eat the eyes.

 Hmm.

 He ate the eye.

 Marge? For reasons I forgot in the car, this sushi represents our marriage.

 But what I know for sure is that I want to share it with you.

 He's taken a step.

 He's really close.

 All he has to do is not eat a piece before I do.

 Okay.

 But every man deserves a second chance.

 As long as he doesn't I'm not hungry.

 Good night.

 Well, at least you don't have to suffer, boy.

 Someone fed my sushi to a dog! You didn't get so mad when I told you I was fired today.

 Blessing in disguise.

 Now you can get your PhD.

 I don't want a PhD.

 I want a baby.

 Here we go again.

 Lisa, I could be anyone for you.

 Except someone who's mean to you.

 So I'm just gonna cave in and give you the cupcake.

 I don't know it's four days old, I just ate Who are you, the Queen of Siam? Just take the cupcake.

 Okay.

 I wonder if Brando liked cupcakes.

 I'm down to two a day, but I've been dead for ten years.

 Aw, Moe.

 Can you think of a way to please a woman that starts with "F"? Hey, you know, it's funny you should mention that.

 I've been reading that, uh, Fifty Shades of Grey, and it turns out that what chicks want now is a guy to give them what for in the bedroom there.

 Whoo-hoo! I'll woo her with whoo-hoo.

 Ah, you know, if this is what women like, I should be a lot more popular.

 But it does inspire me to work on my fan fiction.

 "Sheriff Andy took Barney in his arms "and kissed him deeply, then said, "'Now, if Aunt Bee asks, we were down at the fishin' hole.

'" I-I can't be the only one who likes this.

 Hello, there.

 The minister's wife-- what are you doing here? Um protesting.

 Is this dominating enough for you, sweetheart? Go back to the cowboy thing and wait in the car.

 Help me out here, Homer.

 Listenpal, this may sound kind of kinky, but, uh, I would like to, uh, please my wife.

 Well, are you comfortable with role play? I think I could give it a shot what-what, governor.

 Bob's your uncle.

 Okay, no role play.

 Oh, Marge.

 Come to the garage.

 You know it'll be good 'cause I'm saying it in a singsong fashion.

 It's a snuggle dungeon.

 Hey, Homer, can I get back my What does this do? Now, just relax.

 Sit down Not in that chair! It has no bottom! This is not putting me in the mood.

 Anger's a mood.

 Why would you think I'd like this? I don't know.

 It's just that you always say we should try new things.

 But I thought snuggle clamps just might rekindle Quick, call the Procter &amp; Gamble help line! Really? Geez, they make everything.

 Huh? Oh, my God, Marge is here.

 What is she thinking now? I'm glad you're okay.

 Mmm? Now, I'm going to give you a powerful muscle relaxant.

 Hmm, that was just a placebo.

 What does that mean? Powerful drug.

 Homer, I'm glad that you tried, even though now I can't find the washing machine.

 It's behind the Dingle Swing.

 Oh So you forgive me? Not because of what you bought, but because I realized that no matter what, you will never stop trying, and there's nothing a woman loves more than that.

 Aw, thanks, honey.

 So, uh, you're not cool with any of the toys? Actually, I'm cool with one of them.

 Which one? Not gonna say.

 What size batteries? D.

 Ooh, how many? Sixteen.

 Holy moly.

 And so Homer and Marge's marriage was saved for another week.

 As for Milhouse and Lisa Aw, that's sweet.

 And those are the only two that reached the window.

  What do you get when you fall in love?   A guy with a pin to burst your bubble   That's what you get for all of your trouble  Are we forever to be trapped here in this sea? Look, a light! Perhaps that is the way forward.

 Our journey begins.

 On the next new Simpsons, Springfield fights off a bedbug invasion.

 In two weeks, on Fox.

 Shh!   


                





                    			 Hey! D'oh! Our poor couch.

 It sure has taken a beating over the years.

 Might be time to get a new one.

 Really? You want to throw something out just because it's a little old? Hello, everybody.

 Rotten, damn, lousy Ow! Are there any two words more exciting than "couch shopping"? No need.

 Already went online and ordered a new couch just like the old one.

 And, you know, Marge, those salespeople weren't really our friends.

 But they let me take fabric samples.

 They charged a deposit.

 They had to.

 It came from corporate.

 That's right, sweetie, it always comes from corporate.

 Hey, this one's going to Springfield.

 Chumps.

 Don't everyone know that all New York furniture is full of bedbugs? Forget about it! It's forgot abouten! Ooh, wow.

 Mmm.

 New cushion smell.

 I'm gonna put all my stuffed animals on it.

 All right, get comfy.

 Gentlemen, the fort is complete and will stand forever.

 No way the Nazis will get in here.

 Oh, I thought we were the Nazis.

 The latest New York fashion has come to Springfield: bedbugs.

 Ew, just hearing about them makes me itch.

 Ooh, ooh.

 Funny how the brain does that, huh? It's making me see them.

 The brain is so stupid.

 Those are bedbugs! How did we get bedbugs? Probably one of Bart's dirty friends.

 Boy, why are your friends so dirty? Don't know.

 Why are your friends such drunks? TouchÃ©.

 I know this seems bad, but nothing brings out the best in Springfield like a crisis.

 Bring out your bed! Bring out your bed! No! Hold my hand.

 People, there is no need to worry.

 I have developed the perfect bedbug repellant.

 You see, behold the power of modified bear pheromones.

 Marge, Milhouse was clean as a whistle till he played with your boy.

 Now, we don't know it was the Simpsons.

 I think the most obvious culprit is the poorest family.

 'Tweren't us.

 We don't even have beds.

 We sleep in washtubs and coffins.

 Why won't somebody blame the children? Well, the good news is it forced us all to church.

 You know, in the Middle Ages, people took refuge in church to escape the bubonic plague, but that made the plague spread even faster.

 Church! Everyone, please, calm down.

 Reverend Lovejoy is here.

 He will give us succor.

 The Epistle of Jeremy is often cited as the most difficult book of the Apocrypha.

 But to me, none of the anagignoskomena are more contemplative than the book of Tobit.

 Mind if I p-p-pray through? It's the parson.

 Are you gonna let a sunny summer day be ruined by a few b-b-bugs? God's soldier in cardigan.

 Looks like I picked a swell day to return your six iron, Reverend.

 Now, looky here, Tim.

 This is a five-alarm brouhaha.

 Now, for chili, that's just dandy, but I brought you a little backup.

 I think I'm more than capable of handling this.

 Need I remind you of the bingo riot last summer? God called all their numbers that day.

 Please meet your new associate minister, the Right Reverend Elijah Hooper.

 He was the number two man from Shelbyville.

 Introduced angle parking.

 We got in six more cars.

 Folks, isn't he something? Big hand for Reverend Lovejoy.

 Mm-hmm.

 Everyone says great things about you, Tim, and I can see why.

 The posture, the haircut, the tiny feet.

 It's amazing they hold you up.

 But they do.

 They do.

 So charming.

 It's like he's selling silver polish at the state fair.

 Look, here's why I'm here.

 Church should make you happy, like a warm mug of soup.

 Why does it taste better from a mug? I don't know, but it does.

 God help me, I'm paying attention.

 Okay, who here has read Leviticus? Mmm! Okay, now, who here has seen Meet the Parents? Me! Me, me.

 Me, me, me, me.

 Hilarious film; showed a whole new side of De Niro.

 At first, he couldn't stand his son-in-law, but then they patch things up in a comical fashion, remember? The point is, at the end of the day, we love each other.

 And that's all this thing really says.

 So, don't waste your whole Sunday listening to us.

 Go home and watch one of the Die Hard movies on TV.

 They're always on, and they're always good.

 And, ladies, drop in on a neighbor's open house just to see what they did with their sun room.

 Ooh.

 Ooh.

 Ooh.

 Now, go on home.

 We're here every Sunday, just like Snoopy in color.

 Aw.

 Can you believe this guy, Helen? Hey Helen? Tim.

 Yes, Helen? My wedding ring is creating a glare.

 Can you hold it? This is the worst 17th Sunday in Ordinary Time ever.

 One day out of rehab, and I Ooh Whoa.

 Mmm, debugged and fresh as a daisy.

 Cool.

 They give you a bag of the bedbugs they killed.

 Homer's oatmeal, meet your raisins.

 Homer's Pie Man costume, Lisa's red dress, Lisa's red dress, Lisa's red dress, Sunday Best Bart Where is it? My wedding dress! Vodka? Is this Krusty's? A high-voltage monkey prod? It is Krusty's.

 He must have my dress.

 Let's go.

 What's the hurry? I don't want a comedian knowing my dress size.

 Wait a minute! This has oats in it! Ooh, a nose hair trimmer.

 Yeah, I found a wedding dress in my dry cleaning.

 We used it in a sketch.

 Where's my mail-order bride? Ugh, how long was he in there? Don't worry, we cleaned up the crate real good.

 What about my dress? Oh, gee, I'm afraid that dress is long gone.

 I threw it out the window during my post-show hissy fit.

 Some of us don't have dressing rooms.

 - Wooden! - Plastic.

 Wooden.

 Plastic.

 Why do we always argue over coffee stirrers? You know what's really stirring? Live, local theater.

 Yeah.

 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, before I let a Holy Joe walk in this bar, I got to know which of the two true faiths you represent.

 Well, I represent an easygoing offshoot of Protestantism.

 That is the wrong thing to say to a snake handler.

 Easy, Moe, easy.

 Ah, this thing's just loaded with rock salt.

 I use it to keep the raccoons out of my fridge.

 And, of course, to coat the rims of my margarita glasses.

 Uh, Padre, can I be honest with you? I've sucked every church book ribbon there is hoping to find one made of cherry.

 But there isn't.

 And if it's such a "good book," how come there's no blurbs on the back? Not even David Sedaris.

 And he'll flack anything.

 Seriously, "pews"? Homer, I love your passion.

 It's terrific.

 It's really something.

 Listen, I'm just thinking.

 Would you consider being my deacon? Deacon? Is that like one of those weird Catholic priest things? No, not at all.

 It's like a sexton or a rector.

 Oh, now we're talking.

 But why me? Because, if I can get the man who sleeps through church to be my guy, this town will know that religion can be fun.

 Well, I'm not one for taking new jobs on a whim.

 But, as we say in the snow plow business, I'm your astronaut.

 What do you think? I didn't think Shotgun Mike's Bridal Store had a nice dress, but you found it.

 Homer, you're not supposed to see the dress before the wedding.

 Just looking for the bathroom.

 This is not the bathroom! Aw, but this paper towel feels so good.

 I'm sorry your dress is gone, Mom.

 Oh, sweetie, it's not for me.

 I wanted you to wear that dress at your wedding.

 Well, then, you shouldn't feel bad, because I can't imagine myself ever getting married.

 Homer, your daughter doesn't want to get married.

 That would save us several hundred bucks.

 Tell her she's wrong! Right.

 Uh, I don't understand, Lisa.

 We let you get up early to watch the Royal Wedding.

 Hey, I have a weakness for pomp.

 Since when? So, you see, what Jesus is saying really can be explained by an episode of Californication.

 Oh.

 Now Reverend Lovejoy will lead us in song.

  God lifts you up where you be   God lifts you up where  God lifts you up Um give me a minute.

 Uh, but first, let me introduce our new deacon-- Homer Simpson! It's an honor, sir.

 Homer Simpson a deacon? But why? You bring in the lost sheep, and the others will follow.

 Lost sheep.

 Yes! Sis boom bah! I don't think there's a place for me here anymore.

 Heading for the door, pushing the handle.

 Left foot across the threshold.

 Now the right.

 Walking to car.

 Stepped in hole.

 Twisted ankle.

 Tremendous pain.

 Keep it elevated.

 Church bulletin? Church bulletin? Find out in whose loving memory this week's service is.

 The answer may shock you.

 Dad? You always hated church.

 Now, for the record, I hated the building, the people in it and the spirit it represented.

 I never hated the church itself.

 And now, finally, I believe in something bigger than myself.

 The only thing bigger than you is you tomorrow.

 Why, you little lamb.

 Oh.

 Mustn't kill own son.

 Only God can do that.

  Day by day  Day by day  Oh Dear Lord  Three things I pray  To see thee more clearly  Love thee more dearly  Follow thee more nearly  Day by day  Day by day   Day by day Church bulletin? Church bulletin? Church Someone finally took one.

 I'm mentioned in it 'cause I'm sick.

 Sorry, Maggie.

 I just don't have the touch today.

 Mom, I found your wedding dress.

 How? Using something this town has never, ever seen-- good, honest police work.

 I staked out the alley and befriended the garbage man who took it.

 Then he gave it to a local theater company, who used it in the first unsuccessful version of Mamma Mia.

 In a bankruptcy sale, it was bought by a young couple.

 That couple right there.

 I now pronounce you husband and wife.

 Oh.

 Thank you for finding it, sweetie.

 And seeing someone else get married in it is better than having it myself.

 You never know, Mom.

 I'm only eight.

 I might get married someday, even if it's only a green card marriage to keep a Chinese dissident from being deported.

 We can have the reception at Wong Lee's.

  Day by day, day by day  The deacon's job is pretty okay   Pretty okay  I'm going to be a deacon, day by day   I'm already a deacon, day by day  Dad, the Oogle street camera's driving around town today.

 Want to go moon it with me? Son, I'd love to, but I'm a deacon now.

 My butt's place is in my pants.

 Church songs with clapping.

 I don't think this is what Martin Presbyluther had in mind when he founded our religion by sticking his Three Suggestions under the Pope's windshield wiper.

 Mr.

 Flanders, this new reverend has thrown tar in your half-pipe, too? I don't understand that on any level, but yes.

 Well, let's get Lovejoy back.

 Do you know where he is? He's in a place full of brimstone and exposed flesh.

 You mean he's selling hot tubs? Yes.

 The 7500 is all about jets, jets, jets.

 That's the one place you cannot cut corners.

 That, of course, and underwater speakers.

 That sounds expensive.

 I need this, Apu.

 Sir, can you please turn up the bubbles so we can argue in private here? We wouldn't have to do this if you remembered your Hindi.

 Oh, I remember it.

 I'm just pretending I can't understand you.

 Reverend, we want you to come back.

 Well, let's face it.

 I wasn't cut out for that job.

 Nobody listened.

 Look, the boy's not even listening now.

 He's right-- these underwater speakers are amazing.

 Reverend, this is just the kind of tomfoolery that's been on the upswing since you left.

 Pure, unadulterated tomfoolery! We shall take the 7500.

 And not a single jet more! Sorry, Ned.

 I finally found my calling.

 How are you guys fixed for decking? Oh, what a surprise.

 A huge new expense you didn't tell us about.

 We've lost him.

 Buddy, there's a 50 in my vest pocket.

 Will you buy us some beers? The only cool thing about my dad was that he hated church.

 And now he's turned into a fat version of Flanders.

 No offense.

 None taken.

 God doesn't need Twitter to reach people.

 He uses leprosy and plagues.

 Hmm.

 Plagues.

 Ew, locusts.

 Darkness.

 Yawn.

 Bingo! Flanders, are you willing to get Lovejoy back by hook or by crook? Neither, and I don't like it when other people rhyme.

 Yes, but if I do something, will you look the other way? Hmm.

 I'd like to turn in this boy for thinking about doing something naughty, and myself for waiting 30 seconds before bringing him here.

 Whatever.

 Take 'em away, boys.

 And that's why Flanders will never, ever be my partner in crime again.

 Thanks for bailing me out.

 Yeah, but don't push it.

 There's only so many times I can tell Nana it's my birthday.

 Now, what's this prank? First, we got every dead bedbug in town.

 To think those exterminators were just going to throw these beauties away.

 Now, to leave a nice, clean trail of bugs out of the swamp.

 The frogs follow, and Hooper's got a plague he can't handle.

 Ugh! One of these bedbugs is still alive.

 Much better.

 Ow! He took my contact! Aah! Now I got two in one eye! Remember you said, "When hell freezes over?" I think this is close enough.

 Huh.

 I'm in no position to argue.

 Help! Help! What should we do? We need guidance.

 I have a plan.

 Save your civic leaders.

 Calm yourselves.

 In times like this, there's one almighty being we can put our faith in-- Reverend Hooper.

 It's okay, everyone.

 Who here has seen The Blind Side with Sandy Bullock? Remember when Big Mike was overwhelmed with scholarship offers? Well, that's kind of how we are with these frogs.

 To hell with your references.

 We're dying here.

 I'm more frog than Moe.

 Ribbet.

 Ribbet.

 Do something.

 Um, video games, uh, Twitter.

 Uh, How to Train Your Dragon.

 Fight Club.

 Aah! The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want.

 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.

 He leadeth me beside the still waters.

 He restoreth my soul.

 His words have soothed the amphibious beasts! His boringness saved us all.

 Lovejoy! Lovejoy! Lovejoy! Where do you think you're going? Let us pray.

 All right, we collected all the personal information from Flanders comma Ned.

 Let's move on to the next house.

 Hmm, that's weird.

 Four spheres-- two small, two gigantic.

 Better zoom in.

 Compliments of the deacon.

  Day by day, day by day  I've got three kids  And two are okay  Two are okay  One of them is the baby  The smart one is mine maybe  I hope the boy gets rabies  Day by day by day  Day by day  Oh, I pray  Day by day by day  By day.

 Shh!   


                





                    			 D'oh! Oh, boy.

 Hmm, is that the radon detector? Mom's deleting old TV shows off the DVR.

 What the?! Marge! You're deleting the 2009 Oscar Red Carpet! There were some awesome dresses! And quite a few disasters! Fine.

 What would you get rid of? Well, I can't part with a single one of my Hoarders, hands off my episodes of Episodes, and if you delete Revenge Oh, fine.

 I'll just get rid of these Itchy and Mitchys.

 For every one of my cartoons that you erase, I rip up a family vacation photo.

 And just so you know I mean business, here's an ear! All right.

 At least I can delete these Westminster Dog Shows.

 Fine.

 I'm getting rid of this American Masters "Kitty Carlisle.

" It's not what you think! So I stayed up for the last 87 hours watching all my show Nothing's gonna delete these.

 Guys, there's something I want to tell you.

 Something important.

 So who do you like, the Padres or the Tigers? I'm not talking about baseball.

 I'm asking if a priest can beat a big cat in a death match in some kind of polygon.

 Hexa or octa? Only one way to decide: arm wrestling.

 Eh, who am I kidding? They don't care about me.

 Suicide.

 Finally.

 I'm really doing it.

 No more cries for help! 'Cause this time, there's no one that's gonna save me! I mean, it's not like I'm begging you, please, please show me some love! Yeah, it's nothing like that.

 Eh, maybe I should call.

 Give one of the new kids a chance to talk to the legend.

 Hello, you have reached the Buzz Cola Suicide Hotline.

 Our options have changed, so please listen carefully.

 State the reason you are committing suicide.

 Nothing to live for.

 Ron, first name Moe.

 Moe Ron? Moron.

 It's you, you little puke.

 I am gonna tie a rope around your neck and hang I'll show you who's a moron.

 And that's why libraries use newspaper rods.

 Whoa! I know CPR! I took a class where you do chest compressions to a Bee Gees song.

  How deep is your love? How deep is your love?  Are you sure it wasn't "Staying Alive?" Too on the nose.

  I really need to learn  'Cause we're living in a world of fools   Breaking us down  When they all should let us be   We belong to you and me  I believe in yous.

 You-you guys, you saved me! You do care! Now, wait a minute.

 Got to make sure you're okay.

 Who's the president now? Some jerk.

 He's back! I really want to thank you all.

 You gave me a new lease on life, and I'm gonna take this opportunity to What's the point? Same old stinking world.

 Ah, this post-suicide afterglow gets shorter every time.

 Homer Simpson! The woman I love! I sent you to the store to get applesauce for Maggie two hours ago! Well, uh, I was just leaving, but Moe had an accident! What kind of accident? I, uh, may have tried to end it all.

 I wasn't even good at that.

 Excuse me, will you? That poor man.

 We've got to do something to change his life.

 We could write on his face when he passes out.

 Yeah, that's always good for a laugh.

 No, no, it has to be something big that'll change his whole outlook.

 Why don't we take Moe on a road trip? Aw, that, hey, that's really sweet.

 Hey, can Noosey come, too? Moe, this trip is about turning your life around.

 With the three desperate barflies that you see every day.

 Maybe I should come, too.

 Four guys, a chick and a noose.

 Just like the movies I like to watch.

 Grampa's in charge of you kids while we go to Capital City.

 Ooh, you're a good eater today, Maggie.

 Bart, you're in charge of Grampa.

  There's a swinging town I know called   Capital City Come on, Moe, stick your head out the sunroof.

 You'll look like the richest dog in the world! Eh.

 Lighten up, man.

 The big city! Wow, look at all them countdown clocks.

 Acres of rainforest left, deaths by lung cancer.

 It's magical.

 All I see is two million people happier than me.

 Moe, I know things haven't been easy for you, but you're with people who love you in the most exciting of the twin cities.

 Capital City has a twin? Moved to California to be a star, but it just turned into Glendale.

 So what do you say, Moe? Will you give me a smile? Well, I'll try.

 Maybe if I just tilt my head back here.

 That a boy!  And you'll feel better  You'll feel better, you'll feel better   Better than before  You'll feel better, much better   No, you won't get down anymore  Okay, Moe, one more surprise.

 Gentlemen's Whorehouse? Whoa, ho, ho! No, no, it's a Wearhouse.

 We're all gonna chip in and get you a new suit.

 A new suit?! Oh, ho, ho! I'll be the best-dressed john in the whorehouse! But, listen, are you guys sure you want to spring for something that expensive? Yes, 'cause every time you wear it, you'll know how much we love you.

 Like the one pair of blue pants I bought Homer 20 years ago.

 They're like a wedding ring; I can't take them off anymore.

 Oh, Moe, this suit really brings out the herringbone in your eyes.

 Hmm.

 Nah, it's a 44 long.

 I wear a 38 hunched.

 Got anything for a man my size? Absolutely not.

 Tent City is across the street.

 Tent, eh? Hmm.

 No husband of mine is wearing a tent.

 No tents, no barrels, no kiddie pools.

 Thank you, fashion police! Hey, not bad, not bad.

 And look over there, Moe.

 That's me? Hey, thank you, guys.

 Thanks.

 It's a brand-new day! Okay, final checklist.

 Checklist ready? Check.

 Mom and Dad still gone? Uh, check.

 What about that snoopy girl reporter that's always hanging around? You mean my sister? She's your sister? The plot thickens.

 Clueless little Lisa doesn't suspect a thing.

 Whatever Bart's doing, it's got to be pretty bad for him to get me tickets to this amazing jam session.

 All the greats are here: Jellyroll Jones, Boston Cream Basie, Birthmark Billy Jackson, Grabass Walker, the Fatneck Sisters and Bleeding Gums Murphy?  I got this bratty brother  He bugs me every day No, that impossible.

 He's dead.

 I lay a saxophone reed at his grave every year.

 Lights and magic, Lisa.

 You don't need anything else.

 But I took a bunch of stuff anyway.

 Well, maybe if it's in good taste.

 Aw, come on.

 Five seconds to slip-off.

 And four, three Boy, what are you doing up here?! Also, what am I doing up here? Bart, you said your grandfather wouldn't bother us.

 I gave him a caramel.

 He should have been chewing for hours.

 I couldn't unwrap it! I got you, Grampa! Hold, bolo, hold! I don't want to die! I want to still be a burden! Please be okay.

  How deep is your love? How deep is your love?  Boy? Yes, Grampa?! Kiss my forehead.

 Man, I must real love him.

 I'm not gonna die today.

 Aw, that's so sweet.

 Let's get all our grandfathers and chuck them down this thing.

 All right! All right! Why am I in the basement? Shouldn't I see a medico? If the Wilsons' calf is birthed, Doc Miller should be available.

 Thank God your mental powers haven't deteriorated.

 Well, why the hell am I down here?! I was supposed to be in charge of you.

 I can't let Mom and Dad know what I did.

 But I promise I'll take good care of you until you're well again.

 No deal! I'm getting out of here.

 Ooh, wow.

 My tailbone! And it was my last good bone.

 There, there, you'll be fine.

 I'll take care of everything you need.

 I want a foot rub.

 Yes, but do you need one? Nobody needs one! Now start rubbing! Rub harder! Sorry, pal.

 "Sorry, pal"? Hey, that's common courtesy.

 The kind I've only seen in movies.

 This suit is amazing! Eh, this dump is too filthy for a man with a positive worldview.

 I'm gonna start cleaning.

 Dirt.

 Carpet.

 Another layer of dirt.

 Congoleum.

 Hardwood! The perfect floor for doing a happy jig.

 And now to light up the sign and let the world know that the new, improved Moe's is open for business.

 Hmm.

 Wow, non-losers? Huh, I never thought I'd see the day.

 Gentlemen, what can I get you? We'll take anything you've got aged 15 years or more.

 Hmm.

 Hmm.

 Well, actually, I do have this bourbon that I brewed myself.

 It'll either be the best thing you ever had or the last thing you'll ever have.

 Mmm.

 Huh.

 Wow! Hey, are you thinking what I'm thinking? Moe, we're venture capitalists.

 We turn dreams into money that mostly goes to us, but you get a little.

 Tell me more! How many bottles of this Kentucky Kool-Aid do you have? Just the one, but I could whip up two or 300,000 more.

 Moe, you got a great product, a fantastic suit, and we're gonna give you everything you need.

 Startup money, branding specialists.

 Corporate jets, private drivers.

 If your feet touch the ground, we've failed.

 This is all so sudden.

 Now it's not.

 I'm in! Only one more thing we need to do.

 Check this out with our focus group.

 So, what do we think? Be honest, now.

 I love it! I've made a lot of mistakes, but liking this ain't one of them.

 Every time I call Grampa's phone, I get no answer.

 Uh, he told me he was gonna nap most of the week.

 Oh! Oh, good.

 Well, he needs his sleep.

 Time for your meds! Come on, blue! Come on, pink! Come on, come on, come on! Take it, take it, there you go, yes! After a pulse-pounding race, hypertension pills win again.

 Call me crazy, but I can't stop betting on dementia.

 Now, what say we turn the hot water on and off while your father's taking a shower? Oh! Hot, oh! Cold, oh! Thank God I'm not in the shower! Hmm.

 Grampa, we've been spending so much time together, I almost feel like you're part of the family.

 Aw.

 And I've been wondering.

 Not like I miss having my afternoons free or anything, but are you starting to feel better? Absolutely not! My crotch is crotchety, sitting down makes me uppity, and you call these cups pleated?! Okay, okay, just checking.

 "Dear She-Done-Left-Me Records, "Once again, I write protesting your holographic exploitation "of blues icon Bleeding Gums Murphy.

 "I call for a boycott and girl-cott of your entire catalogue until you" Sonny Rollins? That's right, Lisa.

 And I'm here to beg you to stop writing those letters.

 You're siding with record companies? This isn't about money, Lisa.

 From Tupac Shakur to Dwight Eisenhower, holograms have introduced some of our leading dead people to a new audience of people with money.

 Resetting, resetting.

 From Tupac Shakur to Dwight Eisenhower You're a hologram, aren't you? No.

 Resetting, resetting.

 Have you no shame?! Does this answer your question?  My name is Princess Di  And I'm here to say  When I watch a DVD, it's got to be Blu-ray.

  Take it, Gandhi! First Bank of Springfield-- say "Mumbai" to high checking fees! Hey, thanks, guys.

 I ain't never been to no fancy rooftop party before.

 No beer? That's a pretty big screwup.

 Moe, we got a special surprise.

 You like chicks with nose clips? Then you're really gonna be happy.

 Bring it, girls.

 Hey, that is the most accurate picture of my face made of girl-parts that I have ever seen.

 And it's not decadent 'cause you can ask interns to do anything.

 Thanks.

 Thank you so much, Ken and Glen.

 Ah, you're welcome.

 Anything to celebrate your I.

P.

O.

 tomorrow.

 You know what that is, right? Um Moe, we love your whiskey, we love your backstory, and we love that suit that hangs off you like silk on a skeleton.

 So, starting tomorrow, we're gonna sell shares in your company to the public.

 All you do is show up at the stock exchange, ring the bell, and you'll leave a rich man.

 We'll see you tomorrow.

 Enjoy your last night as a Democrat.

 Dang it, my suit's stuck in the door.

 No, no, no! This building's got 98 floors! And I'm going down to P-6! P-6! Moe? What are you doing? Midge, uh, the suit got a little mussed up.

 I-I got to ask you, is it noticeable? Thank God the kids aren't here.

 I was.

 Aw, without my magic suit, I'm nothing.

 The suit wasn't magic, Moe.

 Don't you know the story of Dumbo the elephant? I didn't go to movies as a kid.

 Spent all my time at the pierogi factory.

 Dab the potato, fold the dough.

 That was my Star Wars.

 Well, Dumbo had a magic feather.

 He thought he needed it to fly, but it turned out the magic was in him the whole time.

 So you're saying Moe is Dumbo, his bourbon is the giant ears, and we're that flock of racist crows? The crows weren't racist, the people who drew them were.

 Okay, I get it, I get it.

 It wasn't the suit that made the bourbon, it was me.

 And I can do anything.

 Don't stand up! Except stand up.

 Grampa, I made your favorite dinner: teething biscuits soaked in buttermilk.

 Oh! Oh! The pain! You're completely fine! I've been taking care of you, giving you love and attention for nothing! All right, boy, I admit it.

 I've been faking being hurt, just like I fake liking those terrible homemade Christmas gifts you give.

 But Mom said it was a gift made with love.

 Did she? No.

 Even she thought it was crap.

 But what you did wasn't for nothing.

 It was the best two weeks of this final horrible part of my life.

 Well, you are the first thing I took care of that didn't die.

 Oh, I hear that a lot.

 Hey-ya, guys.

 Security, there's a homeless monster up here! Hey-hey-hey, I'm your partner, Moe.

 N-Now, let's go make us a fortune, huh? Look! It's Quasimodo without the pathos! People, please, please.

 My name is Moe Szyslak of Makers Moe Bourbon, ticker symbol: M-O-E.

 I'm the CEO, and I promise that I will hand-brew every bottle with these very hands, huh? I-I'll supervise production, I'll manage marketing.

 My face is gonna be on every bottle! And we will only use the finest ingredients made in America.

 Glad you're back, Moe.

 At least I don't have to train the new bartender to make what I like-- beer to the top.

 Not today, old friend.

 But don't worry, holidays are just around the corner.

 Shh!   


                





                    			 D'oh! What the! Hmm? Ew, cheap PVC smell.

 Oh, no.

 I'm an action figure! And I hate action.

 Hiddiley-ho, articulated neighborino.

 Beautiful day, isn't it? Why, it's practically mint on card.

 Shut up, Flanders! This reality ain't all bad.

 Pastry power, activate.

 Whoa! Beep, beep, beep.

 Homer, give me a yank.

 I'm lonely.

 Typical.

 Homer, this isn't the way to the mall.

 The mall? I thought you said Badass City! Tokyo drift.

 I'm fatality.

 All right, Dad! Hey, put the chicken one back on.

 Urgent message from Nelson Muntz.

 Go on.

 Haw.

 Haw.

 Well, I am going to write a note back to Mr.

 Muntz.

 Sorry about that.

 So, Mrs.

 Simpson, the reason you're here Let me guess.

 You need a field trip mom.

 A library volunteer? Someone to Purell the CPR dummy? Resusci-Kate is just fine, thank you.

 We're here to talk about Bart.

 What did he do now? Oh, today, I'm not here to talk about what he did.

 I'm here to talk about the future.

 What did he do in the future? I'm not sure what he's planning, although there is a lot of Internet chatter.

 I want to change his character: less Dennis the Menace, more Casper the Ghost, if he were still alive.

 What if Bart took music lessons? Music classes could channel his destructive impulses into artistic expression.

 I myself have been taking flamenco lessons.

 Got it, music lessons.

 Mother! Right.

 Right.

 Inside.

 Oh, stupid clog.

 My head hairs! I'm bald! Get get get in there.

 D'oh! Aw, damn it! Welcome back to America's Most Tattooed Baby.

 Now, if the Lindblads can fit just one more tattoo on baby Jennifer-- and she's getting pretty full, I can tell you that-- they win the grand prize of $100.

 So what'll it be? Walk away! Walk away! TV's gotten so lousy.

 Did you ever wonder if hippopotamuses think that rhinos are unicorns? TV's not so bad.

 Sweetie did you ever think of doing something a little more creative with your time? If you're worried about your Mother's Day present, it's in the works.

 I was thinking something more artistic.

 Something musical.

 You could take advantage of a fantastic musician living right here.

 That's the kind of riff you can aim for after years of practice.

 We start off with the fun stuff: music theory.

 Don't worry, music theory's just a fancy word for music math.

 My dear boy, you undoubtedly think of the slide whistle as merely a whistle that slides.

 Let me disabuse you of that misperception.

 Pass.

 Do you have any idea how difficult Bye, now.

 Behold! From the pages of Dune and Dune Messiah, Gurney Halleck's beloved zither: the baliset.

 Pass.

 When I die, you will carry on the tradition of the Frink-e-min.

 Pass.

 Ah, Mr.

 Homer.

 I see you are wearing the bald man's beret.

 Is it that obvious? Oh, yes.

 The only thing that screams "I am hiding hairlessness" more is a goatee.

 I'm as smooth as jazz.

 Oh my wife has never seen my head naked.

 Maybe I should wear a cowboy hat.

 A cowboy hat means "I'm ashamed of my small penis.

" Don't even ask me what this means! Yee-haw! I'm a-compensatin'! New student.

 Sit at piano.

 My daughter teach you.

 You, mother! Come to kitchen and see picture of my dead wife.

 That's okay.

 I No, no, no, no.

 She is not dead in picture.

 Uh she is dying.

 Let's go, Bart.

 So, you want lesson? Yes.

 I want lesson.

 I accept your whip.

 A girl who likes candy? Wow.

 So, how much are lessons? I give you something you want you give me something I want.

 I'm sorry, did my voice go all evil? It is common with Russian accent.

 You'd better be asking for something PC: pie or cake.

 Here's my offer: my daughter give lessons, you teach me to drive car.

 There might be some nagging involved.

 Deal! Now we toast with vodka.

 Ah.

 Now we drive! Huh? Homer, I recommend getting drunk on my most expensive beer: Duff Platinum.

 Hey, what the? But I used the best label paste.

 Those two hairs were what was left of my youth, Moe.

 Hey, come on, there's sexy bald, like, um Babar, king of the elephants.

 I read his books as a kid.

 He married his cousin, Celeste.

 That was my takeaway.

 Those royal elephants have trainers to keep them in shape.

 Average schmoe like me, forget it.

 Well, let me see how bald you are.

 Whoa whoa! Dear Lord.

 Here.

 Oh.

 You need this more than I do.

 Just just what exactly is this good for? It's nice when something you plan in your head for so long comes to fruition.

 Where you going, Bart? Piano lesson.

 Ooh, piano lesson.

 We put two of those guys up there just for using a big word.

 "CachÃ©" is not a big word.

 Clickety clack! Wait, wait.

 I'm not learning anything.

 I'm just going 'cause the teacher's pretty.

 Okay.

 But you'd better steal bananas for all of us.

 I will! Let me go.

 I have a swim lesson with a gorgeous lifeguard.

 What gender? You're not allowed to ask.

 Okay.

 Check your mirrors.

 Hands at 10:00 and 2:00.

 Slowly back out of the driveway.

 Aah! Mmm Daddy said I was a accident.

 Okay, let's try again.

 That is so beautiful.

 Did you write it? These are scales.

 Now, memorize: Every good Boris deserves farm.

 Let me try.

 Every good booger deserves flicking.

 Your tongue is nimble, unlike sausage fingers.

 Sausage fingers! Do what I do.

  Druguyu nevestu  Drugoi iyunya  Drugoi solnechni  Medovyi mesyats  Yeshche odim sezon  Yeshche odna prichina  Dlya vupi makin' Ah  Dlya makin'  Whoopee Scales! Lesson over.

 Lesson over.

 Aah! What are you doing? I want to go backwards.

 Like Russian economy, under Putin.

 Stop making Putin jokes.

 You sound like police under Putin.

 Ugh.

 Speaking of police I'm sorry, Officer.

 I believe my license is, uh somewhere in these pairs of easy-fit blue jeans.

 Eh? Eh? That's not the way American police do things.

 Finally.

 Someone who knows what a traffic stop is really all about.

 Uh, Chief, don't you think those jeans are a little tight? We're all not high-waisted like you, Lou, okay? I'm just gonna lie down in the backseat here.

 Okay.

 All right, the blue knight is ready for action! What's wrong? Every note you play sounds like dying animal writhing on keys.

 Awesome! I just want to get more students and help my father with his dream.

 Buying a limo.

 He could tell big shots in the back that, no, they cannot smoke.

 Seriously, I'm gonna make you proud.

 I have hidden talents.

 Oh, Bort, if only you make such a miracle happen I would love your hands forever.

 Wait a minute.

 You can't hear.

 I am so proud.

 I would've been happy if Bart was just a piano mover.

 Thank you.

 I owe it all to Zhenya.

 Can you teach my boys? But no tickling the ivories.

 You treat them with respect.

 Can you teach my monkey? Then I can deal with the Musician's Union instead of the Humane Society.

 Much easier to muscle.

 Zhenya, I couldn't have done it without you.

 And you.

 Bart! Bart, I've never been so proud of you.

 Never, never, never! And now I'll always be at home in a saloon.

 Something smells fishy.

 Yar, that would be me.

 But I agree.

 There's something funny here.

 Is it me? No! Oh Hey, your baseball cap's one plastic bump tighter than usual.

 What gives? Okay, guys, here's the deal.

 I've gone bald.

 Then again, who cares? Yeah, you already landed a hot wife.

 That's the only reason men evolved hair.

 What are you talking about? You lured Marge in with your hair.

 You trapped her with marriage.

 You skinned and field-gutted her by having kids.

 Now she's mounted on your wall for good, with fake glass eyes and a rubber tongue.

 The way you put it, it sounds so perfect, but it's not.

 You sound seriously depressed.

 Why don't we talk about it over at Moe's? It's not even noon.

 Yeah, I've got a watch, egghead.

 I couldn't help overhearing your predicament.

 Mainly because my hearing is so great.

 Who are you? The answer to your prayers.

 Are you my guardian angel? If so, can you turn a pumpkin into a chariot? Even a used Camry would be okay.

 No, just a regular hairless Joe like you.

 Been bald since I was 23.

 With the money I've saved, I bought a yacht.

 Whoa You're cool with it? I haven't even told my wife.

 You wait for the right moment, you show her that glorious dome, and then you rest it sweetly on her bosom and let the kisses flow like rain.

 Wow, is that what your wife did? No wife.

 I just slept with thousands of bald women.

 Caught your recital, Bart.

 Lisa, isn't it great to have a musical genius in the family? Helen Lovejoy, you always have to stir the pot.

 Unlike you, when you make your lumpy clam chowder.

 I guess Bart must be a musical genius, because frauds are always found out.

 Always.

 My work is done.

 Now to reward myself with a case of wine.

 Hi, Zhenya.

 I'm here for my lesson.

 Good to see you, my love.

 Sit on porch.

 Are there other people in here? Because of your performance, I win many new students.

  me on.

 I got to learn my mom's stripper music by midnight.

 But if I got you all these students, shouldn't you be grateful? Oh, of course I'm grateful.

 Here is cushion for porch chair.

 Go to "bata boom.

" Mopped myself into a corner.

 Oh Mom, you'd still be proud of me if I couldn't play the piano, right? Of course.

 But very, very, very angry at all the time I wasted.

 Gulp? Was that a gulp? Are you getting a sore throat? Let me give you some castor oil.

 Hmm You'll need your voice to say, "Thanks, Mom," after your next recital.

 My wha? I signed you up for the 10-And-Below Talent Show next week.

 Huh? You know, I'm almost 11.

 It's not really fair.

 Bart, when you were on that stage, it felt like you were pouring those notes right into my heart.

 Hey, one of those notes could go to your brain and kill you.

 Are you sure you want to take that chance? A proud mother always does.

 First of all, you're over ten years old.

 Second, you're clearly Justin Bieber.

 That's another 25 bucks we'll never see.

 Gosh!  Who can make the sun rise? Why won't anybody tell me? Oh I'm sorry.

 I was faking it.

 I lied so I could see Zhenya.

 Zhenya.

 Oh, Zhenya.

 Everyone knows Zhenya.

 But there's really only one girl whose opinion matters to me.

 My mom.

 I'd like to go home now.

 And to think you'd do this on Mother's Day.

 Is it too late to make you breakfast in bed? Uh, Mom? I'm sorry I pretended to be good at piano.

 And I'm really ashamed that I lied.

 Excuse me.

 Mrs.

 Marge, I took my driver's test.

 Did you pass? More or less.

 If I eat an orange wedge, the whole thing's gonna blow.

 Well, I'm glad your side of the deal worked out.

 What are you talking about? Your boy is genius! No, he cheated.

 Marge, in Russia, everyone succeeds by cheating.

 Even Russian dressing is just Thousand Island.

 But your son is a good boy.

 He cheated for love, and he cheated for you.

 Thank you! All right.

 A chance to make a new friend.

 Listen, sweetie it was wrong of me to force my dreams on you.

 Yeah, your generation won't have any dreams come true.

 Sweetie, you're just gonna be who you are.

 Well, who am I? You are unique, you are special, and at some point, that's gonna come together and work for you.

 I know it.

 Thanks, Mom.

 And that means no punishment, right? Wrong.

 You have to walk all the way over to Grampa to take a plate of cookies I baked.

 Here's your new plate, Grampa.

 Oh, boy! There's crumbs on it! Marge I have something to show you.

 Is it your impression of Mr.

 Burns eating soup? Because I'm not in the mood.

 No, it's something else.

 So? I've always wondered what you were hiding under your curly locks, my beautiful yellow melon.

 Hair, no hair I don't really think about it.

 Confidence is so attractive in a man.

 Tell me about it.

 Oh, Marge, when you hold me like that Thank you, God.

 Shh!   


                





                    			 D'oh! It's been a brilliant night of women's tennis with Petrevkova narrowly edging Mashakova.

 We take you now to doubles action between Pavlyuchenkeka-Vilnikova and Strakova-Mishtnupetrateva.

 To me, it's legs versus boobs.

 What the? Change the channel? But I'm watching soft-core tennis.

 Ki-Ya Karate Monsters! What the hell is that? It's our favorite show.

 Mom said we could watch it.

 Did she really say that? Are you gonna walk upstairs and ask her? No.

 From a Shaolin monastery in darkest Transylvania come helpful hell-spawn.

 With homicidal honor, they rampage for peace.

 Ki-Ya! Ki-Ya! Ki-Ya! You like this now? What about Planet Jackson and the Earth Brigade? Dad, we don't watch that show anymore.

 It's for babies.

 Planet power! Kung Fu Werewolf chop! Blob Jitsu kick! Stop it.

 No Karate Monsters at the dinner table.

 It's Ki-Ya Karate Monsters.

 Samurai shampoo blast! Ninja throwing soap! No Karate Monsters in the bathtub.

 Ki-Ya Karate Monsters.

 - Happy birthday, Dad.

 - Happy birthday, Grampa.

 Did this really happen? Pill attack! Actual sword attack! I've had it.

 No more Karate Monsters.

 Ki-Ya  Ki-Ya That's it.

 Tomorrow, we're doing something educational.

 We're going to the science museum.

 Damn it.

 Finally, actual science.

 You did it, baby.

 You promised no fun, and you delivered.

 Ah, hello there.

 I am Blaise Pascal, inventor of the probability theory.

 What are the odds of meeting you here? Excellent, I would say.

 My friend Silly Squirrel is about to buy a lottery ticket.

 Silly Squirrel, do you know the probability of winning the lottery? I don't know.

 Why, you are more likely to be run over by a car.

 Or be hit by lightning.

 Or murdered by an acquaintance.

 If you understood probability, you would never play the lottery.

 Guys, this science exhibit told me how stupid it is to play the lottery.

 Whoa, whoa, whoa.

 So you didn't buy our weekly ticket? Are you nuts? You can't win if you don't play.

 Hey, it's time.

 Turn it on, turn it on! Four lucky numbers for four best friends.

 Yeah, I always go with three, the number of brothers and sisters I, uh, Hunger Games-ed in the womb.

 best year of my life, 1996.

 My number's 22.

 No reason.

 Just 22.

 And I'm 69.

 Because people always laugh when you say "69.

" No one knows why.

 And the winning numbers are three, 19, Oh, my gosh.

 We won.

 We won the Springfield Lottery.

 That's 200 grand.

 That's 50,000 bucks each! Guys, guys, we got to celebrate, throw a raging party! I'll cash the ticket.

 Homer, Homer, you get the food.

 I'll get mini Dumpsters of wings from Garbage Wings.

 And, Lenny, you get the drinks.

 But we're already at a bar.

 Oh, no.

 That's just gasoline and hot dog water.

 Who cares? We got the money.

 I'm so happy.

 I'm so happy.

 To the best feeling in the world money.

 Guys, I got big plans for these winnings.

 I'm going to build a swimming pool.

 In-ground? So freaking far in the ground, baby.

 What about you, Carl? What are you gonna do with your share of the money? Oh, uh, I guess Carl ain't back yet from cashing in the ticket.

 I'm sure he just got held up in traffic.

 Yeah, that's probably what happened.

 I wonder what's keeping Carl.

 I hope our friend wasn't in an accident.

 I'm glad we're the kind of people who are worried about Carl's safety instead of thinking that he ripped us off.

 I wasn't thinking that.

 Carl's our good friend.

 Our good friend.

 Yeah, good old Carl.

 Good old Carl's phone went straight to voice mail.

 Again.

 The power of friendship is so amazing, I don't feel at all suspicious of Carl.

 Drive faster because of the power of friendship.

 Carl's gone.

 Our money's gone.

 We've been betrayed.

 By good old Carl! Guys, I think we might need a new song.

  Four best friends  Who never quarrel  Homer Simpson, Lenny, Moe and   And And no one.

 All our lottery money, gone! If I ever see that Carl again, I'm gonna freeze him, chop him up into ice cubes and scoop him into the urinal trough at the Gathering of the Juggalos! Guys, give Carl a chance.

 I'm sure he's gonna come back.

 I don't think so.

 His travel neck pillow's gone from its pedestal.

 Fellas, he ain't coming back.

 You don't know that.

 I'm gonna keep looking till we figure out what really happened.

 See, I bet he flew to Quebec to bring us back authentic French-Canadian sugar pie.

 I can taste it already.

 Mmm.

 Thanks for the sugar pie, Carl.

 Hey, what's this? "I've gone home.

 Good-bye forever, Carl Carlson.

" Where'd you go, Carl? Had plans for that money, too.

 I was gonna be one of those guys who's really into hot sauce, you know? Hot sauce suspenders, hot sauce pajamas.

 Bolo tie with a little chili pepper on it.

 I still can't believe it was Carl who took your winnings.

 I thought it would've been you.

 Or you.

 Or you.

 I know.

 Me, too.

 It's the ultimate screw-over.

 Maybe he had a good reason to give you the ultimate screw-over.

 He said he went home, and his passport is gone.

 What country is he from? Uh Uh I don't know.

 You don't know where Carl is from? Come on, you know how dudes are.

 We don't go digging into the past.

 We talk about guy stuff.

 Like baseball and trucks and when guys lift too much weight and their bungus drops out.

 You know, guy stuff.

 Maybe if you'd talked less about guy stuff, you'd know more about your so-called friend.

 Well, it don't matter no more, Midge.

 Carl is gone, and we're already auditioning replacements.

 This could not be more offensive.

 Man! Oh, of course.

 Ugh! Hmm.

 Hey, hey, get that out of here! I don't ever want to see that moolah-stealing jackpot thief again! Wait a minute.

 Something's reflected in the lenses of Carl's sunglasses.

 I just need to get closer.

 He's looking at a geyser.

 And there's a sign in front of it! Oh It's too small to read.

 Oh, it's backwards.

 Try this.

 "Strokkur Geysir.

" Hmm.

 The geyser is one of the most famous natural wonders in Iceland.

 I guess that's where Carl's from.

 Ice-land? Is that even a real place? I thought it was Superman's Superman cave.

 Iceland keeps the most detailed family records of any country in the world.

 There! Carl was adopted by a couple who lives outside Reykjavik.

 Well, if that's Carl's home, then that's where our money is! And that's where we're going.

 We got to pack.

 I guess I'm only bringing one guitar on this revenge trip.

 You're going so far away.

 I'll miss you.

 Baby, I'm going for us.

 That money is going to dig us a swimming pool that'll take our broken family and make it whole.

 We're not broken.

 We're broken.

 We're pretty broken.

 How am I going to sleep if someone isn't pushing me all the way to the very edge of the bed? I've already taken care of that.

 Oh Oh, that's perfect.

 I can't wait to see the smile on Carl's face when we surprise him.

 I call first hug.

 Hey, Lenny, when are you gonna wise up? Carl never wants to see us again.

 I'm done talking to you! This is funny.

 It says here Iceland is green, and Greenland is icy.

 The Vikings switched the names to trick everybody.

 It's funny.

 That's pretty good.

 Great gag! Hey, Vikings, it's still pretty damn cold! I only packed shorts.

 Excuse me, uh, we're looking for our friend.

 He's, uh he's about so tall, uh, wears a jacket, he's, um, got no visible tattoos Just say he's black, Moe.

 You say he's black! His name is Carl Carlson.

 Carl Carlson! His family has been hated for 1,000 years.

 How do you know about Carl's family? Our country is very small, very judgmental and very nosy.

 Ingimar Ogmundsson, how progresses your gonorrhea? It heals, but slowly.

 Why does everybody hate Carl's family? Here's why.

 This saga tells of how Carl Carlson's family were the watchmen of the coast, always keeping an eye out for invading hordes.

 Iceland's safety depended on their vigilance.

 But the Carlsons failed in their duty.

 The enemy invaded, laying waste to our lava fields, burning our sweaters and feasting upon our tiny horses.

 Apparently, screwing over your friends is in Carl's blood-- his adopted blood.

 All right, this is it, Carl's family home.

 Twenty-two Ooh, phew, oh, that's a lot of letters.

 So that's why 22 was Carl's lottery number.

 Yeah, and that's why his sweatpants say "Hjorleifsstrati" across the butt.

 The gates are locked.

 Well, then we'll just have to wait for him to come out.

 Oh, man, stakeouts are so boring.

 I wish I had something to look at.

 Well, I guess I'll just read the car rental contract again.

 Damage waiver, check.

 Return with full tank of gas, check.

 All drivers must be over the age of 25 and check.

 Love you, Mom.

 See you, Dad.

 It's Carl! Wake up, wake up! Huh? Huh? Ah, damn it, we lost him! There he is.

 And he's got our money! It's no use.

 We're perfectly matched.

 We did it! Give us some answers, or you'll get a mouthful of rotten shark fermented in its own urine.

 No, no, anything but the inedible, repulsive food of my native land.

 Yeah, Carl, tell them the good reason you had for borrowing the money.

 Look, I admit it.

 I gave you the ultimate screw-over.

 But I did it to clear my family's name.

 Everyone blames the barbarian invasion on my ancestors.

 But that saga had a missing page.

 Oh, yeah a page was torn out.

 My family's always believed that we fought bravely against the invaders, and the missing page will prove it.

 I took the lottery money to buy that page and restore my family's honor.

 Why didn't you just tell us? We're your friends.

 I didn't tell you because we're not friends.

 Friends share their feelings, their hopes, their dreams.

 Friends know their friends are from Iceland! We are just guys who sit next to each other at a bar and talk about ugh guy stuff.

 So all those years of hanging out meant nothing? Not to me.

 Sorry, Lenny.

 That's all right.

 Now we know.

 It's all out in the open.

 I guess it kind of makes it easier now for me to to kill Carl! When the nice ones snap, it's always a good show.

 Ow, my eye! My eye! My eye! My eye! Hey, hey, hey, Lenny, forget him, forget him! Look, we still got the money.

 - What the? - Wha? What the hell is this? That's the missing page from the saga.

 That's what I spent our lottery money on.

 Then this belongs to us.

 Please, give it back! Please! It'll restore my family's honor! Maybe we'd give it back to our friend, but we're not friends, remember? Sorry, Carl.

 It's World War II all over again.

 America kicks Iceland's ass.

 No! Guys, do you think Carl was right? What if we're not real friends? Maybe we are just lonely guys who do guy stuff.

 Hi, Homie! Did you get the money? The kids have been stocking up on pool noodles.

 Put the noodles in the shed.

 There isn't gonna be a swimming pool.

 Hmm? Carl spent all our money on this stupid page from a stupid saga.

 I say we make it into saga soup and have ourselves a soup sip.

 That'll show Carl for de-friending us in real life! I know Carl did you wrong, but is destroying something he cares that much about really going to make you feel good? Well, we won't know that till after.

 Just read the saga and see what it says.

 But how can we learn to read ancient Icelandic? With these.

 Yeah, my doctor says it's better for me not to sleep.

 Thorn? Yes! Forvitinn.

 I can't do this, I can't do this! You can't not do it! Okay, let's see what this thing says.

 "When the barbarian invaders came, the Carlsons met them with their weapons ready" Wow, Carl's family really was brave.

 "weapons which they immediately "threw down in surrender.

 "The Carlsons then let the barbarians in the back gate "and joined in the sacking, the looting "and the volcano-ing of the village elders.

 "The Carlsons then wrote down this saga so no one would ever forget their treachery and cowardice.

" Carl's family was even worse than people thought.

 They were the original ultimate scumbags.

 Carl betrayed his friends, blew the lottery money all for nothing.

 Hey, guys I think I feel bad for Carl.

 Attention, everyone in Iceland.

 We have an important announcement.

 Take a break from your dreary lives to hear Americans lecture you.

 Ah! Ah! Eh! Is this everyone? No.

 Yes.

 I've learned something about the people of Iceland.

 You have endured barbarian invasions, total financial collapse and a lesbian prime minister.

 You've managed to survive on a craphole island that looks like the moon and smells like rotten eggs.

 And to do that, you have to be stubborn.

 But I ask you to put aside your stubbornness while I tell you about Carl Carlson.

 Shame on Carl's family! The blood of 1,000 tiny horses is on their hands.

 Doesn't matter what happened for Carl Carlson's honor has been redeemed by the deeds of Carl Carlson.

 Carl Carlson who helped me move, even though I moved the week before.

 Yeah, and when we were painting my house, Carl Carlson brought that blue tape, you know, that makes you really look like you know what you're doing.

 You peel it off, and you got that super straight line there.

 And when he brings a six-pack to my house, he doesn't take the extras home with him.

 Carl Carlson leaves them in the fridge.

 Carl Carlson is our friend, even if he doesn't believe it.

 If we can forgive Carl for stealing our lottery winnings, maybe youse can find it in youse's hearts to forgive his ancestors.

 The many small kindnesses of Carl Carlson have redeemed his family forever.

 Mom, Dad, our family can show our face in public for the first time in 1,000 years.

 Ai.

 Ai.

 How can you say these men are not your true friends? I I can't! I can't! Ai.

 Guys, thanks for teaching me the true meaning of male friendship.

 The stuff that comes from in here that is guy stuff.

 We don't get together to share our emotions.

 We get together to escape them.

 Yeah, I'd tell you guys I love you, but, uh, I don't want to say it, and you don't want to hear it.

 To nothing! Okay, everyone, get ready to see your brand-new Oh, oh! What is it, what is it, what is it? keg-pools! Yay! Yay! Hey! Aah! Fine.

 I'm going home.

 Shh!   


                





                    			 Whoa! Hmm? Our first anniversary.

 And we're more in love than ever.

 In your face, people who said it wouldn't last a year! I stand by my wedding toast.

 Let's just enjoy our happiness, Homie.

 Accidental motherhood is the greatest thing that can happen to a woman.

 And I think Bart's finally outgrown his misbehavior.

 Oops, better clean that off.

 You have a great day, ma'am.

 Wish I could get a little of that attention.

 D'oh! Hey, Simpsons.

 Don't mean to be a pesto, but I'll be happy to watch your scampi shrimp.

 Aw, thanks, Flanders.

 Got to warn you, he doesn't talk much.

 Daddy.

 He's not your daddy.

 Nice daddy.

 Moustache daddy.

 Good daddy no yell.

 Fat daddy smell like beer.

 I'll teach you to speak in complete sentences.

 But first, m'lady, let me escort you to Heaven.

 The fancy Swiss chocolate store on level three.

 Oh Oh, Homer, you're the anchor store of my heart.

 Just call me Borders Books, 'cause I'll always be here.

 Haw haw! His first word.

 Oh, Homie, what a wonderful anniversary.

 Yep, we've got something money can't buy.

 Love on a train.

 And I promise each anniversary will be better and better.

 Oh.

 They have to get off and get back on.

 Sometimes you have to say to hell with rules.

 But somehow our anniversaries didn't get better than that first one on the train.

 Wait, you named me after a train? Yeah, just like we did with Bart.

 Anyway, this year, I'm gonna re-create our magical first anniversary, ending with a romantic ride on that Why are you taking away the train? I'm afraid no one rides it anymore So we're replacing it with something that makes money and sends people to the food court.

 Step right up.

 Medical marijuana.

 You got nausea, my friend? Everyone's got nausea.

 And what is your malady, my son? Uh, I had one, but I forgot it.

 Memory loss! Could be a brain tumor.

 Take this and go see Fantasia.

 Kids, I've only had three great ideas-- marrying your mother, using a hot dog as a straw and this romantic train ride anniversary.

 Sir, I need this train.

 Eh, take it home.

 It's yours.

 Are you sure Mom is really gonna want a rusted-out kiddie train? She won't see it like this.

 I'll make this train look as beautiful as it did when this mall was young.

 Aw, Dad, I just got a little twinge in my heart.

 Try this.

 You stay away from my kids unless you're driving them to school! So, I'm not babysitting tomorrow night? Oh, we're still on for tomorrow night.

 Dad, do we have to ride like this? Hey, what could be cooler than a choo-choo with lollipops on it? Hey, babies-- where you going in your baby train? Babytown? Shake it off, kids-- they're just jealous.

 Hey, lardo, where you going in your lardo car? Lardville? There's no such place! Okay.

 I've entered my billing address, expiration date and charged.

 We're back from "Baby Beethovens.

" That's Mozart, dummy.

 Well, thanks for watching Maggie.

 I just ordered Homer's anniversary gift.

 Must be tough.

 Yeah, what size cuff links do you get an elephant? Well, in the first place, the elephant's cuff links would be the same size.

 It's the cuffs that would be bigger.

 As for Homer, I'm getting him a case of his favorite snack cakes, Dolly Madison.

 Marge, this isn't Dolly Madison.

 It's Sassy Madison.

 Trust me, Homer doesn't care where the cupcakes come from.

 Sassy Madison is a dating site for married people who are tired of the same old dessert.

 Check out their webvertisement.

  Kelly was at the end of her wits   Her husband was truly the pits   Her relationship spousal  Had zero arousal  Then she watched this commercial   And found herself Herschel  Thanks to Sassy Madison.

com.

 Sassy Madison.

com.

 It's not cheating if you don't know the person well.

 I just put all my personal information on their Web site.

 So now you're gonna get hit on by every loser in town.

 And this town's got losers like Mexico has headless corpses.

 So many unhappy men.

 How sad.

 You've got a lot of fish wriggling in that net.

 Maybe I should get married so I can date these guys.

 Selma, cheating is a sin.

 As much a sin as not replying to an instant message.

 So, if you'll excuse me, I've got a lot of sleazy gentlemen to let down gently.

 Are you watching the commercial again? I'm a fan of animation.

 Oh, Lord, may thy couplings stay forever locked, and may thy dead man switch never be used.

 Amen.

 All right, guys, let's get this train fixed up for Homer's anniversary.

 But first, start your power tools.

 One more to go, and I'm done.

 "Dear Horny in Haverbrook: "Sorry.

 I'm not interested "in cheating on my wonderful husband, "who is described in the attached PDF.

 "Say hello to my trash folder.

 Marge Simpson.

" Hi, Homie! A crazy thing happened when I was ordering your anniversary gift.

 Don't blow the surprise.

 Pretend you forgot.

 Uh, anniversary? That coming up? Yes, and it's a big one.

 Remember? Marge, I am focused on this like a laser.

 "Laser.

" That's a funny word.

 It's just "loser" with an "A.

" And speaking of losers, I lost my train of thought.

 Oh, and speaking of trains, wait till you see The surprise is safe.

 The expression on her face will be priceless.

 He forgot our anniversary again? He remembers the exact number of pork chops in the freezer.

 Currently-- zero.

 One of those cyber smoochers wrote me back.

 Thanks for your note.

 You seem way too nice for this site.

 Why are you here? Good question.

 "I thought I was buying snack cakes.

" That's so cute.

 Really, really cute.

 You you are over 18, right? "I am, and you seem more interested in my day than my husband.

" I know what it's like not to be listened to.

 Please ignore every sensible instinct you have and continue this conversation.

 And by the way, this is my real voice.

 Don't worry, Moe.

 When Marge is asleep, I'll sneak back.

 Oh, good, the strippers are here.

 Oh, yeah.

 Oh, yeah! That is all coming off.

 "Tell me more.

" Homie, I bet you're wondering why I stayed on the computer until 4:00 a.

m.

 Hey, those Yelp reviews don't write themselves.

 Did you know a well-placed one star can destroy a mom-and-pop hardware in nothing flat? Listen, I want us to be honest with each other.

 Uh-oh.

 If you're honest, you'll have to tell her about the train.

 Huh? What train? How stupid are you? Hey, thinking is your department, jerk.

 That's what I pay you in beer for.

 Just for that, I'm not gonna help you.

 What? Where are you going, you? Oh! Um, Marge, I have to go.

 What? Now? Why? He's writing me again.

 Better put a stop to this.

 Is that him getting the text? He's in the market.

 We might have squeezed the same tomatoes.

 Are you Marge? Ooh, I'm going to hell.

 I'm sorry.

 I didn't even know you were here.

 What a crazy coincidence that you buy food, too.

 Gee, I thought you'd be some kind of creep.

 But you're actually a perfectly normal-looking Whoa! "A" is for "apple," right? Okay.

 I'll-I'll just be going.

 Wait, wait, wait! Let me get the stain out.

 But not here.

 I know a place where no one in town will see us.

 There you go.

 Good as new.

 Now, let me at least buy you a coffee, or dare I say a Danish? No Danishes! Sorry.

 I go to pastry way too fast.

 I want to be very clear.

 I'm a happily married woman.

 Going on ten years.

 The aluminum anniversary.

 Nothing turns leftovers into swans like aluminum.

 What the heck am I saying? Homer's probably at that bar right now, getting hammered.

 All worth it for Marge.

 Marge, you are terrific.

 I am so glad I reset my distance filter from 15 to 25 miles.

 Mmm Your Homer is the luckiest man on earth.

 Well, he keeps falling down a cliff and living, so I guess that's true.

 The only time my wife and I talk is when I apologize.

 "Life's an infernal muddle," as Mr.

 Drake says on Upton Rectory.

 Ooh, I love that show.

 Isn't it great? Finally, a reason to watch TV on Sundays.

 Such great characters, like Buxton, the scheming larder-keep.

 Why can't Lady Cavendish see he's pilfering the aspic? Uh, does does Homer watch? He says shows set during World War I are too sad.

 Particularly how everyone's always climbing stairs.

 You are watching the season finale this week, right? Yeah.

 Alone, I'm sure.

 Well, we could, uh live blog it.

 Save that sugar for your coffee, bub.

  I've been working on the railroad  Why are you singing that? Because it's in the public domain.

 Hello! It's Moe from Moe's Tavern.

 Oh, uh, I'd better take this.

 You see, Moe's been depressed and needs to hear a friendly voice.

 Why the hell are you calling me at home, you moron?! Lovejoy went to get a hamburger, and the whole thing fell apart! I'm getting cooked like a cabbage.

 Then keep quiet like a cabbage! All right, all right, I'll be right there.

 Is it me, or did this house just get classy? Mom, Lisa made me break a lamp.

 Mom, Bart's twisting facts in an Orwellian fashion.

 Can I have one hour of grown-up time where you two aren't tattling on each other or using obscure references? Orwell, obscure? The author of Animal Farm? Grampa says he was a Commie.

 No tattling! Upton Rectory is made possible by a sizeable endowment from Hooters Restaurants, and a generous grant from a man named Generous Grant.

 Are you watching it? No, I can't.

 My wife's watching a reality show about a man who repossesses zoo animals.

 Come on, Taser that flamingo! Can't believe I'm missing the finale.

 Hmm Maybe I can help.

 Bless it all, Polly, I love you! And we shall be wed by Boxing Day Eve, aka Christmas.

 But Lord Upton has forbidden it, on the grounds that he once saw me exchange pleasantries with the Egyptian riding master.

 Can you follow everything okay? I guess sometimes you just don't end up with the person you're supposed to.

 Marge, can I use your free Amazon shipping? Not a good time! I know your password! Drake, Polly, perhaps I was too hasty.

 Love should flower, even an ill-advised alliance between a coarse Irish maid and a man who once served me soup from the wrong side.

 He hasn't been the same since the war, Lord Upton.

 Hush, Polly.

 Who you marry is none of your concern.

 I have something to say.

 The dowager grandmum! I'm afraid you cannot marry without a proper ring.

 Take mine-- the Star of Bombay.

 Once again, India is denuded of her treasure by the imperialist devils.

 Why do we watch this show? Because I like the costumes! I've never felt so flushed after watching public television.

 Maybe sometime we could watch it in the same room.

 Chat room? Room room.

 Show's over! That turned ultra-steamy in a jiff.

 I can still hear you.

 I can still hear you.

 Happy anniversary, Mom! Happy anniversary, Mom! Our gift is us! Three kids with no money, but plenty of love! That's great.

 I wonder what surprise your father has in store.

 Boy, oh, boy! Oh, Marge, I threw my back out! Can you please refill this prescription right away? Where's it from? It's in Drugtown not the nice part.

 That'll take hours! On our anniversary! And what better way to spend it than commemorating the glorious words you spoke ten years ago: "for worse.

" Oh! Oh! Ow! Ooh! Hmm.

 It's working.

 She's gone.

 All right, everyone, magically appear.

 Wow, Moe, great shrub costume.

 Yeah.

 I sell 'em on the Internet for like-minded people.

 Now, let's lay some track.

 You guys are the best.

 I just want you to know when I'm holding Marge in my arms tonight, I'll be thinking of all of you.

 When does it get better? When he's 800 pounds and has to be cut out of the house to go to a movie? I lost my cleaning stick in my belly fat.

 But I found a kitten.

 That is so sweet.

 There I go again, settling.

 Marge, run off with me.

 Bring your kid.

 I have three kids.

 Whoa, you really went all in with this guy, didn't you? Get out of my head.

 I guess this is good-bye, then.

  Someday  When I'm awfully low  When the world is cold I said no! Fine.

 Sorry.

  Just thinking of you, Marge  And the way you look tonight.

  The Nelson Riddle Orchestra! Leave me alone! Fine.

 Sorry, guys, you're dead again.

 I'm gonna do what I've done at every key point of my life: suck it in and smile.

 There goes a woman who's unhappy with her partner.

 Yeah, I know how she feels.

 Yeah.

 What was that? What the? Happy anniversary! Oh, my God.

 Our train.

 Homie, you do care.

 You care a lot.

 What a wonderful anniversary.

 Do you think we'll last 25 years? Nothing should.

 Trains they can fix every marriage.

 What the? Ugh.

 Happy moment derailed by the Bipolar Express.

 None of you heard that.

 Happy anniversary! Where is she? Where the hell is Marge Simpson? Ramona, please! When you asked me who she was and where she lived, I never dreamed you'd go confront her! Mmm, I'm Marge Simpson.

 So you're the kind of man-eater Hall and Oates warned us all about.

 Hall and Oates? What's going on here? Your wife and my husband have been watching British TV together! Costume drama or naughty comedy? Drama! Drama! You just dodged a bullet, Mr.

 Sugarpants.

 Ben, Ramona, I want to tell you something I've learned over ten years of marriage.

 The secret is: no secrets, except good secrets like this train.

 My only secrets are: My marathon time isn't 4:26; it's never, I often go online to see how Lindsay Wagner's looking now-- fabulous-- and I once pushed a kid off a swing and he broke his wrist or something.

 But it's no secret how much I love my Margie.

 Mmm Mmm Look at them, coochie-cooing like that time our connecting flight was delayed and we got drunk and friendly in the Admiral's Club.

 That was you? I mean, it-it was wonderful.

 And you're fighting for me.

 Maybe that means you still care.

 Of course I do.

 Now, let's go home and spend a romantic night looking through your computer's browsing history.

 That exists? Oh, boy.

 Honey, just what was going on with you and that guy? Well  I was trying to buy you snack cakes Oh, baby, that's all I needed to hear.

 How did we get here?  Marge was feeling lonely and bored   Every night she was ignored  But when Marge went boo-hoo  I was building a choo-choo  And love conquered all  With a train from the mall  So that very same night  Ben went back on the site  And he lined up a date with SelmaÃ³BÃ³88   She said that she's smokin'  And I wasn't jokin'  Find love on the net   You deserve what you get   Three awesome kids and a life of regret  And now it's time for Grampa's song!  Down by the old Not the new, but the old  Mill stream Not the river, but the stream.

  Where I first Not the second or the Shh!

 (doorbell rings) Give me your candy! LISA: But the Simpson abode was deep down in the dumps, 'cause from little to bigger, the kids had the mumps.

 MARGE: Now, I'm off to a party, my outfit is chic.

 It's a Catwoman costume, I'm sure is unique.

 (dog howls) Wait a second-- it's Halloween? Just rest on the sofa, I'll be home by 10:00.

 Can we have some candy? Just one M&amp;M.

 LISA: Then we heard a loud crash.

 HOMER: D'oh! We were tempted to scat.

 BART: And we looked and we saw him LISA/BART: The Fat in the Hat! I'll save Halloween for you three grumpy tots.

 Just stick out your rumps for some mump-stumping shots! (sighs) Now hop on my cycle, there's nothing to fear.

 And we shall have candy and maybe some beer.

 Huh? You should not be here when their mother's away! And you should be dead, you're so wrinkled and gray! I'll give you the business, you yellow sea cow! This go-getting oldster will Where am I now? (grunts) We'll fix up this mix-up in two minutes flat, with the helpers I've hidden right under my hat.

 (kids exclaim) I uh, I knew there was something I left off my list.

 Without food, air and water, they cease to exist.

 (explosion) I am the Borax.

 I speak for the woods.

 But I've plastered my likeness on consumer goods.

 HOMER: Sellout! Hey!  Oh, the Fat in the Hat doesn't care what moms say   The minute they leave you, he'll take you away  (gasps)  His breakfast is dinner  His dinner's dessert  You might see his name on an AMBER Alert!  Trick or treat! Who buzzed the buzzard? Don't pester the rich.

 I don't hand out candy, you son of a Gritch.

 BART: He pulled out bamfoozlers and side-winding gizzles.

 (explosion) (laughing) He laughed as he heard that old codger's house-sizzles.

 Let this be a lesson to those who love cash, that your nice stash of cash could be gone in a flash.

 And if you are awful and nasty and cruel Enough with the lessons! This isn't a school! (neck cracks)  Once a year we are not hungry   Thanks to Christian charity.

 And you just pissed off the wrong fat, furry drunk! (gasps) Hey, hey, hey! This is supposed to be a children's story! Go grab all his money and vodka and gin.

 And I'll knit a nice thnord from his leathery skin.

 Say, Mr.

 Hat, I don't mean to complain, but you promised us candy, not mayhem and pain.

 BART: The dude thought a while, then said: I know a man! With an overpriced store, who'll give all that he can.

 Take whatever you want.

 I don't want any trouble.

 Take Jims that are Slim, and gum of the bubble.

 I won't shoot you now, 'cause I've found something cruel-ah, an afternoon off with eight kids and Manjula.

 (bike bell rings, kids laughing) (kids laughing) No!  Oh, the Fat in the Hat  Has some anger issues  And some highly unusual political views   If he comes a-calling, you'd better hide   'Cause he's committing aggravated floop-fluffle-cide!  Don't forget me!  Floop-fluffle-cide! BART: We had to escape from this behatted mammal.

 (burps) LISA: So we hitched us a ride on a three-hump gumbamel! A gumbamel's a camel but faster and humbler.

 It doesn't take tips and it's never a grumbler.

 So if you must leave in a kind of a scramble, then jump on the hump of a humble gumbamel.

 BART: But if the gumbamel should ramble, then stumble, then just hop atop a Krustiferous Krumbull.

 But then if that Krumbull should happen to tumble, just call your amigo, the bee man of bumble.

 (exhales) BEE MAN: Ay-yi-yi! LISA: We thought we'd escaped from our psychotic guide but when we got home, he was waiting inside! I'm staying forever.

 You're all stuck with that.

 'Cause I'm your new daddy, the Fat in the (screams) I'm frightened of nothing, not even hellfires.

 Just don't let me ever be played by Mike Myers.

 (groans) BART: Now please do not worry, 'cause we did okay.

 Yes, kids will get candy, whatever you say.

 PILOT: What the hell?! (Bart laughs) Bart, isn't it dangerous to fly your kite PILOT: Stupid kids! by an airport? Hey, if they get on an airbus, they know they're taking their chances.

 Kite at 2:00! I don't know what that means, I have a digital watch! (pilots scream) (both groan) What's my wife's picture doing on your control screen? Over.

 Homina, homina, homina.

 Over.

 (yawns) (groans) Nowhere to tie my kite and I forgot my scarf.

 (gasps) Bingo! I'm seeing a 12-car pileup, a naked rooftop cookout, and Oh, my God! A box kite! (screams) (sighs) Well, at least it's a beautiful night.

 (grunts) I'm alive! All patched up! End of story.

 Actually, there's a little more.

 Ay, caramba! I'm sorry.

 This was the only way to lengthen Bart's life for a year while shortening yours by 30.

 I thought I was donating blood.

 You are.

 Along with lymph, spinal fluid, and all the trimmings.

 (chuckles) But, Lisa, your brain is still in complete control.

 I could do what I want to Bart's head? Aw, geez.

 Strangle me out of this, Fatso.

 Why you little! I'll teach you to make medical history! Oops.

 Ah, all good.

 D'oh! (neck cracks) (humming) (spits) Hey, boy, since you don't need a bedroom anymore, I finally get my man cave.

  Man cave!  Everyone's welcome to my man cave!  I assure you, we've spared no effort to accommodate your special-needs student.

 And done.

 So, in conclusion, my show-and-tell is this! Excellent, Lisa.

 A-plus.

 Bart, your turn.

 Well, my show-and-tell is that I'm on Lisa's body.

 Derivative and repetitive! F-minus.

 Aw! (giggles) Bart, I expected more from a fourth-grade head.

 (gasps) You're rotating it in the wrong direction! (both grunting) That was gonna be my show-and-tell! Bart, Lisa, I'm afraid you two are going to be together for a long time.

 Why don't you try to say something good about each other? Well, she's pretty healthy for someone who's been living with cooties.

 Bart, aren't Lisa's ears clean? Yeah.

 It's like looking down a Canadian tunnel.

 What else? Well now I always have someone to eat lunch with.

 Great! That's as much therapy as your parents can afford.

 I think we've made some progress here.

 Great Oh, and I have this "two heads for one" coupon.

 Well, that's for lettuce.

 How about this one? "One random disorder free with every schizophrenia.

" That's mine, but it's expired.

 D'oh! (playing "When the Saints Go Marching In") Should've chopped off Bart's head long ago.

 Sleep well, Lis.

 Somehow, sewing my head on your shoulder brought us closer together.

 Rainbow oh, Rainbow Oh not the pony dream again.

 (gasps) Hey, I did that.

 Yep, that's me.

 When she's asleep, I'm in control.

 Lis, I'm gonna make sure you stay asleep.

 (laughs evilly) Ooh, mix-ins! Mmm.

 (snores) (falls down stairs, grunts, shouts) Son of a (grunts) (snoring) (engine sputters, dies) You start a car as well as you start a family.

 You wait here while I go get the jumper cables.

 MRS.

 SKINNER: Oh, a panic attack, huh? Well, I'll give you something to panic about! (grunting) (groans) Now I'll just cut off her annoying head and this body will be all mine.

 Or we both die.

 Not really sure what the rules are.

 (gasps) Why, Bart? I thought we were friends.

 A brother can never be friends with his sister.

 Are you really, really sure? I'm afraid I am.

 Well, then, I guess I have no choice.

 (yells) How could this go wrong? 'Cause in a head-to-head battle, the one with the most brains wins! (groans) (groans) Well, wherever I am, it's gotta be an improvement.

 Guess again.

 (moans) Now I can always sing karaoke duets.

  Mock Yeah.

  Ing Yeah.

 I feel your pain, brother.

 Now, I need you to memorize these 10,000 setups by next week.

 Help me, Doctor.

 So this is what successful post-op looks like.

 (circus music plays) BURNSUM: Step right up.

 Step right up, only two bits! (snickering) (slurps, growls) Thrill as Thrill as Marguerite conquers the air! (cheering) Laugh at the clown's buffoonery! Seriously, folks, I really think we should stop this Hitler guy.

 (laughing) Disbelieve, as the Strong Man pulls a wagon with his bare tongue!  This is the song that you hear at the circus   Sung by a guy that you see at the circus  (muffled):  Do-do-do, do-do-do  Do-do-do D'oh! Or gape in terror at Almighty God's whoopsy-daisies the Freaks! (crowd exclaims) The Human Donkey.

 Hee-haw! The Terrifying Callback.

  Mock Yeah.

  Ing Yeah.

 Creatures from another galaxy! Actually, it's more of a globular cluster.

 Not the dark, not the dark! Ah! And now I must ask that small children leave, good women avert their eyes, and men take a stiff slug of circus whiskey.

 Behold, the most hideous creature of all.

 How ya doin'? (audience screams) So, uh, anyone here from New Jersey? I'm goin' there next week.

 (screams) (humming) (humming continues) Whoa! (grunting) (humming) Hey, torso! Huh? What's with the cookies? Even the human snail would've been done by now.

 I am so sick and tired of people assuming that the human snail is, in some way, slow.

 Good day! (grunts) All of you! Get back out there with your flippers flapping, and your stumps a-stumping! Joe and Jane Normal expect some entertainment for their nickel! Mr.

 Burnsum! You should treat these poor people with respect! Marge! Get away from those freaks.

 You belong to me! The dumb, hairless brute.

 Well, you are the best this circus has to offer.

 (laughing) Taste the strength of your fiancÃ©.

 Ooh! Ooh With the mighty tongue God's given you, why can't you speak kindly of these imperfect angels? Marge, they knew what they were getting into when their parents sold them to the circus.

 Enough! You will comport yourself with the dignity expected of a traveling freak show.

 (grunts) Excuse me, ma'am, but, uh, I ain't never seen a normal stand up for us.

 (sighs) I, too, am a freak.

 One eye is blue, and the other a pale brown.

 I wouldn't want to be you, lady.

 Never give up hope, my friends.

 Of all the kisses I have ever gotten in my life, that was the first.

 Hey, you should ask her out, Moe.

 Ah, but she's sweet on the strong man.

 You're fine unless Rabbit Ears hears and tells Big Mouth.

 (whispering) Wha?! I ain't got no chance with the strong man's girl.

 He makes ten dollars a week plus all the sawdust he can eat.

 Well, you've got an emerald ring.

 My mother's ring.

 (sobs) She gave it to me on her deathbed.

 She also acquired it on her deathbed.

 That was a very busy deathbed.

 With an emerald that big, I could buy anything.

 A jalopy, an icebox, a steamer trunk full of fedoras! But how do I get my hands on it? Oh, I'm an idiot! Of course! I get Marge to marry Moe, then I kill Moe, then she gets the ring, then I marry her and the ring is mine.

 And the brilliance of my plan is its simplicity.

 You're gonna be sorry you said that.

 You're gonna be sorry you said that.

 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh I just lost my keys! Whoa-whoa-whoa What do you know? I am gathering moss! (owl hoots) Hey, Marge, you want to marry Moe? I'm engaged to you, my love.

 The poor, lonely fellow is about to die.

 Really? How? Well, let me worry about how.

 But you know, you could make his last day a happy one.

 And the ring is just the icing on the cake.

 What ring? The ring that'll get me out of this lousy circus and into a good circus.

 Now, let's get you married.

 But wouldn't you be jealous, my love? (laughs) Dear, I am not the jealous type.

 And from you, I have learned to feel compassion for these disgustos.

 Aw (solemnly):  She's a superfreak  Superfreak  She's superfreaky  Yow.

 "Yow" indeed.

 And so, with the conclusion of our traditional wedding song, I now declare you husband and wife.

 Moe, whatever small time together we have will be wonderful.

 (laughs) A very small time! Those are strange things to say, but a wedding is no place to worry about threats from the bride's former lover.

 Now, the toast.

 To you, Marge.

 Now you are one of us.

 FREAKS (chanting): One of us! Gooble goo! One of us! Gooble goo! Why is it company parties always get weird? (cork pops) God, you are so beautiful in that peignoir there.

 I, uh, better freshen up a little bit.

 (humming) Set it to "massage," Jumbo.

 (humming) Hmm? What are you doing? Oh! Trying to kill Moe so we'll get his emerald! By the way, I haven't checked, but emeralds are valuable, right? (gasps) Strong Man! Moe may be ugly on the outside, but inside, you are the true monster.

 Leave my trailer forever! You're rejecting me? But I'm in the best shape anyone is in the 1930s.

 I said go! (whimpers) (chanting): One of us! Gooble goo! One of us! Gooble goo! What the hell does "gooble goo" mean? (chanting): We don't know! Gooble goo! We don't know! Gooble goo! (gasps) You killed Burnsum! Now who is gonna say, "Step right up"? FREAKS: Gooble goo! Gooble goo! Tar and feather him! Tear off his drumsticks! Make him one of us! FREAKS (chanting): One of us! One of us! This is exactly why circus attendance is plummeting! And that, kids, is how I met your mother.

 ( How I Met Your Mother theme music playing) and FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY FREAKS (chanting): One of us!   


                





                    			 (exclaiming) (school bell ringing) (Barney belches) (tires screech) D'oh! (tires screeching) (grunts) (gentle orchestral music playing) (wind whistling) S-So lonely.

 (raspy): No sex without a ring.

 Damn it! (gentle orchestral music continues, giants laughing) (belches) (creaking)  Mm.

 What the?! Hey, whoa! (ghostly moaning) (crackling) What about us, man? Get your own couch.

  (soft organ music playing) (organ music continues) Poor Chip.

 Such a big part of everyone's life.

 People called him the "sixth Simpson.

" I'm not sure why.

 Chip did such a wonderful job with my biography.

 (people murmuring) Chip was the life of Sector 6-F at the nuclear plant, but Chip once confessed to me he did have a few regrets.

 (all gasp) Chip regretted never ascending Mount Springfield from the south face.

 He regretted that the high school long jump record he set was wind-aided.

 He often spoke of that asterisk.

 He never broke par on hole 17 at Springfield Mini Golf.

 (organ music resumes) Let us pray.

 Eh, everyone has regrets.

 Not me.

 You? Your marriage is a dead fish floating in a tank of stale beer.

 Your baby's addicted to pacifiers.

 And your son is out of control.

 Let us kneel.

 (pained groans) Ow! My knees! (cackling) He's such a little dickens.

 Although Dickens was pretty well behaved.

 He's been screwed up since the moment Homer's DNA staggered into your womb.

 I have no regrets about that.

 It was a perfect pregnancy.

 Didn't smoke, didn't drink, lost three pounds.

 And every night before bed, Homer would give me a little kiss music! (gasps) Could Bart have been prenatally screwed up by the KISS music?  Get up! Everybody's gonna move their feet   Get down! Everybody's gonna leave their seats   You got to lose your mind in Detroit Rock City.

  Huh? Man, this is the weirdest pregnancy craving ever.

 Well, for some reason it relaxes me.

 Now, do that thing Gene Simmons does.

 Overstay my welcome for 40 years? (whistling a tune) KENT BROCKMAN: Regrets, eh? This local newsman's had a few.

 Covering a town of backwater rubes who, for some reason, hate my guts.

 This is Kent Brockman (sighs) live at the Springfield Peach Parade.

 Sir, could you give us eight seconds of your homespun wisdom? It's a little-known fact that you can get head lice from peaches.

 Uh, this is my daughter Peaches.

 (sighs) We'll have more regrets at 11:00 tonight following an all-new bottle of scotch.

 HOMER (scoffs): You have regrets, Mr.

 "I Get to See the Weathergirl From the Side"! I made the worst financial decision of all time.

 Oh, I can't think about it.

 I won't think about it.

 I don't want to think about it! Oh, I'm thinking about it! Mm Hmm.

 Huh? (shudders): Oh that's the coolest bowling ball I've ever seen.

 Hello, Bear Stearns? I'd like to sell all my Apple stock so I can buy a fancy bowling ball.

 You heard me.

 Technology is a fad.

 Heavy, black balls are the future.

 Now let us text on our ubiquitous Apple tablets and phones.

 (keys clicking) Oh, you cost me a piece of all that! Oh, don't cry.

 If it makes you feel worse, I'm the man who bought the stock you sold.

 I'll bet a rich man like you has no regrets at all.

 Just one.

 The girl that got away.

 She broke my first heart.

 So, is there truly anyone among us without regrets? I have no regrets.

 Really, Mother? Oh, I didn't see you there.

 (Irish accent): I'm Father O'Greedy.

 Dimes for the needy.

 (Milhouse chuckles) Milhouse, are you the bottom half of that mischief? MILHOUSE: Uh uh uh Oh, my.

 My pants, like the Lord, work in mysterious ways.

 Return those vestments.

 Speaking of return on investments, my Apple stock is up 3,500%.

 Aw, you misheard that on purpose! (grunting) Tithe denied! Tithe denied! Mm.

 Must find way to blame myself.

 Um, it says I should give you lumbar support.

 Better go to the lumber yard.

 "Lum- bar.

" It means "lower back.

" How many times will you make that mistake? (groans) Just put on the KISS record.

 Which one? Anything from Love Gun.

  Hey, book, are you expecting this? And while I'm at it Burn, dumb, helpful books.

 That is a good fire.

 (grunting) (pants) You're going down, Bart! (grunts, groans) Why? Ah, reckless youth.

 He'll be okay.

 I was referring to him.

 I had a spring in my step like that once.

 Back when I met Lilah.

 Lilah ran a little crepe stand in the seventh arrondissement.

 Oh, Monty, looking at you, I could lie in this unheated garret forever.

 There's heat.

 I just don't turn it on.

 Seeing you there, in the sweet light of Paris between the wars, there's a question I must pose.

 I have something for you.

 Oh! Not that.

 (chuckles) (grunts) (bubbling) (chuckles) Wrong box.

 Lilah, will you take that big step from cousin to wife? (gasps) Oh, Monty, you must promise me one thing.

 Anything she wanted I was willing to do.

 Anything, except All I ask is that you set aside five minutes a day to think of others.

 When you say "others," could they be bars of gold? (crying): I shall find another husband as good as you are evil.

 No one's that good.

 (sobbing) All I have left is my drawing.

 Hm.

 It looked a lot better in my memory.

 Uh, but you know what, Smithers? I will find Lilah and win her back.

 I'll just check with the old gang.

 Hemingway! Picasso.

 Matador Juan Belmonte.

 And Stalin.

 That man could really put pressure on you.

 Hello, Kent.

 Well, well, well.

 Rachel Maddow.

 Everyone came back for Chip's funeral.

 I was flying from DC to New York and, of course, I had the layover in Springfield.

 How's the gang at Channel 6? Look, let's get this out of the way-- just because we both worked at Channel 6 and you made it big and I didn't doesn't mean I'm bitter.

 Um, Is that your car? Maybe.

 Kent, I'm gonna tell you the most important mistake you ever made after this break.

 So, Kent, that mistake you made, that fundamental, life-changing error, that cosmic fail, that Just tell me already! After this break.

 You could have come with me, but you were suckling the dual teats of infotainment and celebrifawning.

 (upbeat theme plays) So, tell us about your new movie.

 It's fantastic.

 The studio let us play in their sandbox.

 Great.

 We have a clip.

 No! No, don't show it.

 There aren't five good seconds in the whole film.

 (car door closes, tires screeching) I'm not a newsman anymore, I'm a geologist.

 I keep discovering a new rock bottom.

 Kent, I think I found my ticket out of this town.

 Or at least to a better Springfield.

 You two newshounds working on a story? How about this? Mario's down the street found a rat in their pasta.

 When did that happen? Whenever you want.

 Eh? Rachel, can I come? We can share blazers.

 Just follow me.

 At Mario's, the picture of Sinatra on the wall is signed by Frank Junior.

 The frame hides the "Junior"! Someone's been dumping tires in the forest.

 Willikers! In my three years of soft news, I've never seen anything like this.

 Those are tires from my ill-fated Krusty Town Car.

 It would explode if people gripped the wheel too tightly.

 (laughs): What a scoop! You're not telling no one.

 As the 4:00 p.

m.

 clown, I have complete control of the Channel 6 news division.

 Local news is a joke.

 I'm going to cable.

 Cable news! Bah! People only want news at 6:00 p.

m.

 from white guys on weekdays and black guys on weekends.

 We'll see about that.

 Yes, we shall see.

 About that, things will be seen.

 By us.

 Kent, you coming? He ain't comin'.

 This little piggy's afraid to leave his cushy anchorman slop trough.

 Could you, uh, phrase that a little more nicely? Sorry.

 He "isn't" coming.

 You'll regret this, Kent.

 When I have my own show and you're stuck here tracking Santa's flight from the North Pole.

 "Oh, look, he's over Greenland!" Don't worry, piggy, you made the right choice.

 Eh, it'll burn out in an hour or so.

 Grunting as he lifts Bryce in the air.

 Look, Burns, I've got the dope on your sweetie.

 She's still alive, and she just got over being mad at you last week.

 Lilah's alive? Yeah, well, uh, she's alive, but she's a nun.

 Married to Jesus, eh? Does he beat her? Jesus? No, he's a real Eagle Scout, that one.

 But your penguin's not a Catholic, she's a Buddhist nun-- spent her life expressing her sexuality with a Zen garden.

 Those raked rocks could have been me.

 Now, since you're so good at finding things, find the exit.

 There is the little matter of my fee.

 You're becoming very tiresome.

 Who moved my desk?!  Well, here I am.

 Cable news alley.

 (dog howls) Fox News.

 Is this really how I want to get back in the big leagues? Let's see how print journalism is doing.

 Sir, do you sell The New York Times? Sir, we are The New York Times.

 And in I go.

 Why are you doing this, Bart? He's gonna visit my sky granny.

 To work at Fox News, all you have to be able to do is operate this device.

 Now, when a Republican is in trouble At the time, I didn't know it was illegal to sex up a cow on the Capitol steps.

 we simply do this.

 Now you try.

 Sorry, but I just discovered I have some scruples.

 I'm going back to my sweet little town where I can decide what news is.

 Like a god.

 We've had some good times.

  Memories  Rest between the pages of my mind   Memories  See me through the ages just like wine  And you sat on the gas pedal when my foot fell asleep, so I'm getting you shined up nice.

 What the? Oh! That's a ball-proof window, sir.

 Would you like me to ask Siri for a nearby hospital? SIRI: I'm sorry, I don't see any "hops petals" near you.

 Deleting all contact information.

 No, no, I didn't ask you to do that, Siri.

 I Delete confirmed.

 BART (groans): Oh.

 Okay, Bart, be cool.

 Calm down, you're not gonna die up here.

 (indistinct chatter) (whooping, gunfire) (yells, whimpers) Aw D'oh! Oh, Monty, I can't believe you found me after all these years.

 I've saved myself for you.

 Well, then, uh (nervous chuckle) I should disrobe at once.

 Housekeeping? Send up a Chinese dressing screen and one of Firestone's finest vulcanized prophylactics.

 Be right back.

 (laughs softly) Smithers? Which do I take first, the rhino horn or the tiger tongue? I have my doubts about both, sir.

 Bah! I'll just do it the old-fashioned way.

 With my pump.

 (engine sputtering) (sputtering continues) (chuckles): Just powdering my nose, darling.

 (engine continues sputtering) Smithers, run down to Sears, Roebuck and get a five-eighths-inch Phillips head bolt.

 (tires screech) (sighs) Here I am, slowly dying every day at 5:00, 6:00 and 11:00.

 BART: Help! Help! Child in danger with exciting visuals! This kid's corpse could be my magic carpet.

 Get me a cameraman! The movie Up has come horribly to life over Springfield.

 A local boy clings to life in a story that proves this reporter's relevance.

 BART: Ay, caramba! (gasps) It's Bart! Pray for a miracle, boy.

 God can hear you better from up there.

 Dear Lord, please help me land safely.

 Or transform this basket into a flying killer robot that I control with my mind.

 Amen.

 That's not a prayer.

 My God says it is.

 Oh, I see you're ice-cold with anticipation.

 Dead? Oh, Lilah.

 Even at the end, I waited too long.

 What if I give her the breath of life? (soft exhale) Oh, boy.

 I guess one regret just leads to another.

 You know, sir, maybe it would bring you peace to honor the one thing Lilah ever asked of you.

 Here you are, my good man.

 A little broth will cure your mental illness.

 (chuckles) Sir, that's five minutes.

 You can stop thinking of other people now.

 You know what, I think I'll give it another five.

 I'm proud of you, Monty.

 (kissing) I ain't eatin' that.

 Chief, what are you doing to save our son? Well, I've placed marksmen on the roof to shoot the balloons one by one, but frankly they're not very good.

 (gunshot) (grunts) (whining): Chief, it happened again.

 Aw, come on, guys, spread out.

 Arm's length.

 It's all my fault.

 I should never have listened to those KISS albums when I was pregnant.

 Marge, with all due respect, that's ridiculous.

 My Sarah listened to Mozart and Churchill speeches when she was pregnant with Ralphie, and he can't even open a refrigerator.

 Pushing, always always pushing.

 Really? Oh, yeah.

 That kid's a mess.

 Hey! Only I get to criticize him, Lou.

 Kid's scared to flush.

 Think's it's his brother.

 Can we focus on my son up in the sky? Oh, I've got a long-shot idea.

 By which I mean firing a shot over a long distance.

 (chuckling) Yeah, you see, if we could fire an exactly 12-and-a-half-pound weight into the basket, it would lower the boy very gently to the ground.

 Unfortunately, all our cannonballs were melted down to make a statue of Joe Paterno, which we changed to look like Eugene Levy.

 I think I just might have what you're looking for.

  Today I'm glad that I sold that stock.

 Uh, Apple closed up another 20 points today.

 (whining): Why does everyone know? Because their terrific products keep track of it for you.

 And anything else you could ever think of.

 That kid's not dying on my watch.

 Which ends right now, fortunately.

 (hums a tune) (whimpers) CROWD (chanting): Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart! (laughing): Hey.

 CROWD: Bart! Bart! Hmm.

 (yells) Homer's rising faster than Apple stock.

 (laughter) (Homer yells, grunts) My boy's okay! CROWD (chanting): Bart! Bart! Bart! I won the science fair! I get to go to Chicago! CROWD: Bart! Bart! Bart! Ugh.

 Bart, Bart, Bart.

 You know what I think about regrets? As long as your family is together, every choice you've ever made is the right one.

 And together we are.

 (gunshot) Would you guys knock it off? He's down safe already.

 (gunshot) MAN: Sorry, Chief, that was me putting it down.

 And there you have it-- a family reunited.

 And a grateful nation gives thanks for some solid reporting.

 Back to you, Rachel Maddow.

 Great job, Kent.

 I think we might have an opening for you at MSNBC between our weekend prison documentary block and the two hours it takes to make up Joe Scarborough on Monday morning.

 (chuckles): No, thanks, Rachel Maddow.

 I'm happy right here.

 No regrets.

 and FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY Hah! Shh!   


                





                    			 (exclaiming) (school bell ringing) (Barney burps) (tires screeching) D'oh! (tires screech) Not again! (classical music playing) Now, I, Bart Simpson, shall send the first coaster down the track.

 Hmm.

 (Milhouse grunts) (gasping) No, for once, I want to go first.

 But, Milhouse, I already let you push me on the swings.

 And it's an honor, but I'm doing this.

 Ow! Knock it off, Milhouse! (grunting) (yells) Eat safety bar! (muffled): Why are we best friends? Because your seat was behind mine! (both grunting) (groans) (both crying) Feels like this playdate's gone on forever.

 I'll handle this.

 "Dear Weirdo, pick up weirdo kid.

" And send.

 Aah! (gasps) Did you eat a peanut? No, I just sniffed a nectarine.

 It's okay.

 I can breathe through my tear ducts.

 (whistling) Tell me if this gets annoying.

 (whistling continues) I think I'm gonna throw up the mac and cheese you fed me.

 I'm not supposed to have it.

 That's why I had so much.

 HOMER: What the?! If this kid's dad isn't here in one second, he's going in the garbage can.

 (car honks) Hey, guys! Who wants a whiff of New Kirk Smell? "YOLO"? You Only Live Once.

 Once again, cats have it better.

 Kirk Van Houten.

 I hope you're not having a midlife crisis.

 Please.

 Just 'cause I bought a new car, lost a little weight and started taking a DJ class, everyone thinks I'm having a midlife crisis.

 Dad! You got me a skateboard? It's for me.

 Now get in the back.

 And while you're there, use this cream to massage the leather.

 (leather squeaking) To the tooth-whitening kiosk! (laughing) I'm sorry, but does Kirk know how silly he looks? Look at me! I'm afraid of dying.

 (laughs) Oh, Homie.

 I'm so glad you're happy with your life just the way it is.

 You've had the same job, same car, same house for 20 years.

 And that's all you'll ever have.

 A cycle you'll never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever change.

 And you're okay with it! Like I say night after night after night nighty-night.

 (birds chirping) Kent Brockman is here for your interview.

 So, Kent, what brings you here? The miraculous tale of how we lost, then found, our Lost and Found box? Actually, Principal Skinner, I'm here to talk about something else cheating! (chuckles) I thought this was a puff piece.

 You're wearing a sweater.

 This journalism just turned gotcha! (gasps) That's right, Channel 6 will uncover the truth in a five-part series two minutes a day.

 People, make room for your local Emmy nomination certificates.

 No, do not make room.

 Except for Mr.

 Largo and his diet, there's no cheating in this school.

 These 30 identical "What I Did This Summer" essays say different.

 Um Myra, don't I have another appointment? Oh, this is your first appointment ever.

 Let's take a look at this monitor.

 This school is more corrupt than the Italian parliament.

 If these children are our future, then I, for one, do not want to live.

 NELSON (quietly): Ha-ha.

 Please don't air this.

 I'll tell you the winners of the kickball games in advance.

 You can make a lot of cabbage betting on K-ball.

 And that's what we'll end the story with.

 No! This is Kent Brockman.

 Pleased with himself.

  You only  Live once  Or so it seems  No life for yourself  And none for your dreams  You work  Every day  At a job so lame  And every night  The ending's the same.

  No dream will come true  You only  Live once.

 (deep breath) (crying to the tune of "You Only Live Twice") (higher-pitched crying) Yeah, well, at least you got your health, huh? Now let's see if I can take that away from you.

 Your poison.

 (groans) I'm tired of living once.

 I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm starting to regret saying "YOLO.

" Marge, if you don't mind, I'm gonna quit complaining about my life and start wallowing in the past.

 Postage, marked in pesetas? Who are those letters from? My old pen pal from Spain.

 - Eduardo.

 MARGE: Hmm.

 Back in fifth grade, you either had to write to a foreigner or a prisoner.

 I picked a foreigner because the prisoners wrote back too fast.

 We'd write each other with our dreams of the future.

 I was gonna be King of Cheeseburger Mountain.

 (sighs) Did I change or did they stop making mountains out of cheeseburgers? Probably a little bit of both.

 So sad.

 (indistinct chatter) (overlapping chatter) What kind of moral example is this dump for my boy? (burps) (crowd clamoring) Please, calm down, everyone.

 You know, maybe this so-called cheating scandal is actually an opportunity to, uh (clears throat) initiate a-a dialogue that would, uh, create a teachable moment.

 Uh, something, something buzz word I got nothing.

 Quick, get a picture for the yearbook! (crowd clamoring) LISA: I have a solution! You took your sweet time coming to our rescue, Lisa.

 Maybe the best way to keep students from cheating is to trust them not to cheat.

 (crowd murmuring) That's it? That's all you've got? Something I can read on a tea box? What I'm suggesting is we create an honor code.

 Oh, swell, more work for the teachers.

 The students would do it.

 Let her speak! If every student pledges not to cheat, and to turn in any cheater, no one will cheat the system because they'll be the system.

 ALL (chanting): Honor code! Honor code! I did it.

 I saved the day.

 The same way I won that battle in Vietnam.

 By fainting! (doorbell rings) If you're my wife's secret lover, come in.

 There's nothing I can do for her anymore.

 I am looking for my amigo de la pluma.

 Or "pen pal.

" (gasps) Eduardo? Is it really you? Why are you here? To save the soul of Homer Simpson.

 Now where is he, old man? I'm Homer Simpson! Ay, dios mio! What has happened to you? (speaking in Spanish) Did your hair burn off in a fire that trapped you in a candy factory? I wish.

 Marge Simpson.

 It's so nice to meet a friend Homer met through the mail who isn't a sea monkey.

 Yes, Eduardo Barcelona.

 Or in English, Eddie Miami.

 Homie, I thought a visit from your old pen pal would cheer you up.

 Ah, how eagerly I would wait for a letter from the EstadosUnidos, and Homer Simpson.

 HOMER: "Buenos dÃ­as, Eduardo.

" HOMER (continues): (chuckles) What happened to us, Eduardo? We had so many things we were going to do.

 And I, my friend, have been doing them.

 Yeah, well, listen, pal.

 I have my treasure-- my wife and my children.

 Ooh! I've had eight wives and 200 children! Among them artists, doctors and revolutionary chefs.

 Do you have a disrespectful son who calls you by your first name? I cannot imagine such a creature.

 Hey, Homer.

 Did you just fart? Did you just fart, sir.

 BART: Whatever.

 Easy, easy, Homer.

 I want to help you fulfill some of your childhood dreams.

 Really? Now? I have two pizzas coming.

 I wanted to see who would get here first.

 Now, Homer! Get your coat.

 I asked him here to cheer you up.

 But I didn't think you'd drop everything to go gallivanting with some, no offense, Spaniard.

 I promise you one thing, madam.

 When I return your husband, he will be happy, bringing a new sense of adventure to your marriage and to the bedroom.

 (panting) I'm not used to strange men saying the word "bedroom" around me.

 Would you prefer, uh, "sala deamor"? That's even worse.

 Could you say it one more time? Sala de amor.

 (gasps) Ooh! Hello, children.

 I hold before you a copy of the school's new honor code.

 (all groaning) I know if I can get the toughest kid in class to sign it, the rest of you will sign it.

 Milhouse? (grunts) He's not the toughest kid, I am! Mm-hmm! Now, the smartest kid.

 Milhouse? He's not the smartest kid.

 I am.

 Now the class nerd.

 Milhouse? (sighs): Oh.

 (snickers) Homer, are you prepared to achieve the dreams of a ten year old? I took the liberty of crossing off the, uh, stupid ones.

 Now, this book of your childhood drawings will come to life.

 Why are you doing this? Wait, are you in love with me? In love with the concept of you, yes.

 Woo-hoo! I'm an attractive concept like Liberty! (siren wailing) (tires screech) One more ride? All right.

 Don't forget to ring the bell.

 (bell ringing) (laughing, grunting) I'm sick of pirates off the street ruining my play! I'm going back to my old career! Care to see a dessert menu? We have the best cobbler since Daniel Day-Lewis.

 How much did this cost to restage? They rented everything from Comic Book Guy for ten bucks.

 Don't stink up the Gorn head.

 I need it for a Bar Mitzvah later.

 (birds chirping) Now don't forget, this is the first exam under the new honor code.

 They're doing it.

 They're self-proctoring.

 Can't you say anything in a normal way? The answer, sadly, is not yes.

 (crickets trilling) I don't know what it is about having all my dreams fulfilled, but I feel great! Oh, if you're happy I'm happy.

 What? That doesn't sound happy.

 I feel kind of, oh melancholy.

 Mmm, melon collie.

 (barking) That's not helping.

 Well, what was your childhood dream? Jumping on the bed.

 But I never disobeyed my parents.

 Till I married you.

 Let's do it.

 Oh, I'm a little tired.

 Could we just snuggle again? We do that every night! Come on! Jump on the bed! (Homer giggling) Ooh, okay! (both laughing) Can I help you, stranger? I am just watching my friend and his wife innocently pleasure themselves in bed.

 That sounds salty, but you seem sweet.

 I'm gonna call you Kettle Corn.

 Eduardo, I haven't felt this good in years.

 You're like the Tooth Fairy.

 Except you don't collect human bones.

 Yes, yes.

 Of course I don't.

 Here.

 So, that's it? All my dreams, lived? Eh all but one.

 Well, we've got to do it! I never leave a job unfinished.

 It's as true now as that week I worked on the high school yearbook.

 So much infighting.

 I had to get out of there.

 All right, Homer, we shall do this thing.

 The editor put in like six pictures of this girl 'cause she was his girlfriend.

 Everyone has a bad yearbook story.

 They spelled my name wrong! Get over it! Ha! D'oh! (propellers churning) So don't do what I did.

 That concludes our safety video.

 (grunts) Just step out that door and you can glide to earth like your boyhood hero Rocky the Flying Squirrel.

 Uh, actually, my hero was the actress who provided Rocky's voice, June Foray.

 A true legend in the voice-over community.

 I'm just gonna stay on the plane and think about her influence.

 She has lived her life.

 Now, you must live yours.

 No! Do not worry! I will follow the trail of your fear! (Homer yells) ANNOUNCER: Will Homer make it? Or will he leave a crater the size of the one that destroyed the Yucatan? Find out in our next exciting installment: Fat Splat or When You Squish Upon a Car.

 Mmm, it's amazing.

 Every day has the peace and serenity of a flu outbreak.

 (laughs) Guess I'll be getting some extra credit for this.

 Lisa, I'm afraid you've gotten all the extra credit we can give out.

 So Willie has been growing you a nice pumpkin.

 Here it is, lass.

 You want me to carve it into a thank-o'-lantern? No, this is good.

 Well, this knife's got to carve something.

 (menacing music playing) (grunting) Homer! (grunts thrice) You don't have to flap.

 Just glide on the wind.

 Uh, okay.

 Flap! Flap! Flap! Flap! Flap! Flap! (grunts twice) Yes, good, much better.

 (groans) I got Bart's backpack.

 He got a hundred on his test? That's impossible.

 (gasps) Is Bart cheating? Are the Pope's tweets infallible? (laughs) Bart, I'm gonna tell! No, you're not.

 Because if you tell people I cheated, that means your system failed.

 Oh, my God, you found a loophole! Why don't you put this much inventiveness into your work? Because then I'd be the one thing I swore I wouldn't.

 You.

 (whistling) I'm doing it! I'm flying like the squirrel I always knew I was.

 Ooh, indigo! MARGE: Homer? (yells gibberish) It's me, talking in your earphone.

 Come down, Homie.

 "You only live once" also means when you die, you die! (cries out) What's going on? Hello? (goose honks) Hmm? (honks) Hmm? Hmm? (honks) Are you mocking me? You can listen to your wife when you are dead.

 Savor the moment.

 Majestic eagle.

 Just like me, unashamed of his baldness.

 (eagle cries) So beautiful.

 Aw, he probably sees a mouse he wants to tear in half.

 (grunts) D'oh! Stupid tallest building in Springfield! (grunting) Hmm (grunts) (grunting) Ha! Whoa! You've presented me with quite a conundrum.

 A word you should know since it was on a vocabulary test you aced.

 (giggles) But after some thought, all my worries went away.

 I know the answer.

 I'm gonna force you to turn yourself in.

 Good luck with that.

 The only thing that'll change my mind is a sign from God.

 (Bart grunts) Son, it was so beautiful! I went faster than the speed of sound.

 (Homer yelling) (grunts) Well, Bart, is that enough of a sign for you? All right, I'll turn myself in.

 It'll give me a chance to work some more on the detention quilt.

 (humming a tune) (all grunting) This patch is for all the victims of atomic wedgies.

 My friend, you've lived your dreams.

 No matter what, Homer Simpson has done it.

 And soon I hope I remember who Homer Simpson is and his relationship to me.

 But I have no regrets.

 In fact, all this has given me a sense of calm I've never had before.

 That's the morphine.

 Can you give me the morphine forever? No way! A person on morphine all the time would constantly dissolve in inappropriate laughter.

 (laughs) (sighs) Eduardo? Eduardo! Eduardo! (grunts) Oh.

 It was all just a dream.

 EDUARDO: It was not just a dream.

 And you said you'd drive me to the airport.

 Oh, yeah.

 Great.

 Um Do I drop you at the curb or do I have to park and walk you in? Go as far as your heart will take you.

 You are a good friend.

 and FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY  You only live once  But that's okay  You'll live quite long  In the USA  But back to my point  You only live once  You've got years and years  Unless it's just months.

 Shh!   


                





                    			 (oogah horn blows) (exclaiming) (school bell ringing) (Barney belches) D'oh! (tires screeching) (grunts) (angry shouting) (dramatic music plays) (cries out) (belches) MARGE: Oh! Come on.

 Just pick one.

 (sniffing) Oh.

 Fine, you can have your old one.

 (Marge sighs) You can have one of these.

 (sniffing) Hmph! Did you know some historians think American football is based on an ancient Aztec game? It's not American football, it's just football.

 Bart, you're not annoyed that Milhouse asked me to go to the American football game instead of you? Mom, Lisa's ruining football.

 American football.

 No time for breakfast, Marge.

 Just give me a banana.

 (humming) Now, listen.

 I have to work late tonight.

 Again? I was hoping you could spend some time with the kids.

 It's a tough economy.

 Money doesn't grow on trees.

 It grows on threes.

 (laughs) Yeah, I'm out.

 Me, too.

 Too rich for my blood.

 I should not have anted with my blood.

 Whew.

 You got the touch tonight, Homer.

 (chuckles) Nice sunglasses, Lenny.

 Homer Simpson.

 Do you really want to keep cheating your friends, lying to your wife, and avoiding your kids? What would Jesus do? Hey, you gotta pay to find out.

 You looking for a tell? I don't have one, my friend.

 What? What are you lookin' at? I'd better call it a night, guys.

 I don't want to take any more of your money.

 Mm.

 Mm.

 Mm.

 Hmm.

 Who's president now, Alexander Hamilton? I think it's Obama.

 Hold the door, please.

 (breathes heavily) Two minutes apart.

 Timing the elevators, eh? Oh.

 Smart.

 Oh.

 No, no.

 I'm timing my contractions.

 I think I'm in labor.

 Deep in labor.

 Okay, okay, no worries.

 What the? Oh! Do you have a cell phone? Everyone has a cell phone.

 Mine's at home.

 The most beautiful moment of my life is happening now.

 Everything will be fine.

 UmOh you, uh, you like movies? This reminds me of that scene in Alien.

 What? The scene where she escapes with the cat at the end.

 Aw, well, that's sweet.

 Listen, I'm glad I'm not going through this alone.

 I haven't seen my boyfriend in months.

 Oh, uh, he was just here.

 No, he wasn't.

 But thanks for lying.

 You like lies? Here's a few: College is expensive but it's worth it.

 I think the baby's coming.

 Okay Homer, remember your Lamaze training.

 Now, this next position is fantastic for women who are carrying especially big.

 Homer, can you demonstrate? Mm-hmm.

 Mm Oh.

 Yeah, wow, that does feel good.

 Oh, no, I think it's coming.

 Oh, I haven't even picked a name yet.

 You did this to me.

 No, I didn't.

 I'm talking to the baby.

 Here it comes.

 Um, I don't know how to tell you this, but your baby doesn't have any legs.

 What? Oh, wait, there's more.

 Mm.

 (grunts) (baby cries) It's a dude.

 And he's uncut.

 Very Euro.

 Now, hug your mommy.

 For unto you is born this day, in this elevator, inspected in August 2009, a baby.

 (elevator motor humming) (relieved sigh) Well, it was nice to share this moment with someone who cared.

 Yeah, that guy didn't even look over once.

 Lobby please.

 (grunts) (moans) How was work? Miraculous.

 Mm? Mothers are so awesome.

 Oh.

 These are great seats.

 You can hear the players swear from up here.

 PLAYER: I'll kick your ass, Milhouse.

 ANNOUNCER: And now, to take your minds off the massive concussion and subdural hematoma you just witnessed, please welcome the Springfield Atomettes.

 Now, for this routine, we need the help of a junior Atomette.

 They're picking me, Dad.

 Don't call me "Dad.

" If people think peanut vendors have families, it's too sad.

 ANNOUNCER: Looks like we've got a volunteer right there.

 (gasps) Look, while I'd like to help, I'm kind of pessimistic about the team's chances.

 They're gonna get creamed.

 Go, go, go! Mm? (crowd cheering) Uh  (crowd cheering, whooping) I'm dating a cheerleader.

 LISA (in the distance): No, you're not.

 PLAYER: Burned again, Milhouse.

 (crowd chatter) Wow, that was great.

 Can I have my regular clothes back, please? No problem.

 Great job, ladies.

 Now here's your which should just about cover your parking.

 I can't believe he pays you so little.

 The crowd was crazy about you.

 I know, but what are we gonna do about it? If we pipe up they'll put us in the mascot costume.

 WOMEN: Ew.

 After you wear that, you need to be hosed down for bedbugs.

 Good game, everyone.

 I never dreamed a night where you discovered I was cheating and beat the crap out of me could end on such an up note.

 See you next week.

 WOMAN: Homer.

 Hmm? Hey, Gretchen.

 I had your jacket cleaned.

 Good as new.

 And thanks for loaning me your sweater for the ride home.

 It may be a little stretched out.

 Geez, that was a pregnancy sweater.

 So, you want to hold little Homer? Wow, so nw there's two things named after me-- a baby, and a law banning air horns after 3:00 a.

m.

 (nasally): Aw that's sweet.

 (tires screech) MOE: Read 'em and weep.

 The novels of Charlotte Bronte.

 CARL: Um, I thought we were playing cards.

 Uh, hey.

 I was just driving by with some baby stuff we didn't need and, uh, well, here's some diapers Maggie's too big for, and an incredible educational toy I forgot to give Bart.

 Thanks.

 Hey, could you babysit for an hour? I've been alone with the baby for days.

 Wow, I'd love to help, but I did kind of have plans for tonight.

 MOE: No, you can't leave.

 I'm dealin' you in.

 (grunts) (screams) Full house? You win again? I think I'll be good tonight and stay in with you.

  Baby, baby, please let me hold him  Where's Hoju? Where's Hoju? (screams) Where's Hoju? Where's Hoju? Where's Hoju?! (sobbing)  We want to make him stay up all night   Yeah, we do.

  (song ends)  Itchy and Scratchy show.

  A child arrived just the other day   He came to the world in the usual way   But there were planes to catch   And bills to pay  He learned to walk while I was away   And he was talking 'fore I knew it   And as he grew, he'd say, "I'm gonna be like you, Dad"   "You know I'm gonna be like you"   And the cat's in the cradle  (explosion, music stops) Kids blow up so fast.

 (Homer humming) Oh! Homie? Aw, you're shopping ahead for Maggie.

 Oh, no, I'm shopping for Homer Jr.

, a baby I delivered in an elevator the night I pretended to go to work but was really playing poker.

 What?! (grunting) This simulation has been brought to you by your brain, a subsidiary of your penis.

 Oh, yes, I'm shopping for Maggie, our baby together, so this looks perfectly innocent.

 Why are you saying that? Oh, you know how the first few weeks are: sleep deprived, walking around in a fog.

 First few weeks of what? Um, November.

 (groans) (grunting, low chatter) Hey, Atomette.

 I want to say Caitlin? Lisa.

 Guys, do you realize you're being exploited by this team? ALL: Wha? They sell your posters, workout DVDs, and all of your practices are broadcast on a webcam.

 And some of the angles are low.

 But don't worry, collective bargaining will enable us to secure concessions.

 Uh, we're gonna push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em way, way back.

 All the way to a new contract.

 'Cause union power is a fact.

 And we're Okay, okay, we get it.

 Well, look who's here.

 You been hit by the cheerleading bug, little lady? Actually, I've been hit by the unfair labor practices bug.

 What? Why, that's Samuel Gompers talk.

 Now, little missy, the only thing you should be organizin' is your dollies.

 How? By size, brand, value? And don't even suggest race, 'cause I don't see that.

 I just see little people I own.

 What do you say, ladies? (indistinct whispering) Not right, not fair.

 Let's say it with our hair.

 Okay, fine.

 I'm gonna give it some thought, then say no in the nicest way possible.

 No.

 Oh, good.

 Nice.

 "Beat Dallas.

" Can never argue with that.

 Hey, ladies.

 My vest isn't the only thing that's ripped.

 I am in the market for a backup mistress.

 Possibly two.

 Have you kids seen your father? Surprised he's not here ogling these girls.

 He said he was going to work.

 On a Friday afternoon? (gasps) I bet he's playing poker again.

 Coming through.

 Wife on a mission.

 Go, fight, win.

 Marge.

 Wow, I've never burst through a banner before, but it really does the trick.

 (pounding on door) Homer, I know you're here.

 Your car's outside.

 Where is he? I honestly don't know.

 I'm just teaching myself massage here with online videos and a store mannequin.

 Oh, I'm so sorry.

 So, do you have any injuries I should know about? Oh! Hmm, if he's not in there, where is he? HOMER: Oh, baby.

 Oh, baby, shake it.

 Homer like.

 (gasps) Oh.

 Shake it.

 Now, roll over on your tummy, just like I taught you.

 Tell me what a cow says.

 (toy moos) Aah! My other baby mama.

 So this is where you've been going.

 Another woman's apartment.

 Marge, it's not what you think.

 Quiet.

 You're upsetting Homer Jr.

 (quietly): You have a baby together? Oh, it's cool.

 We did it in an elevator.

 (gasps) I'm a Schwarzenegger wife.

 But you're also the housekeeper, so it's all good.

 It's not good.

 None of it's good.

 I haven't had a drink for a week.

 That is pretty good.

 So then you delivered her baby right there  in the elevator.

 It's true.

 Even the other guy in the elevator-- he's right here.

 And the really funny thing is I'm a doctor.

 Well, I'm glad you did a good deed, but you shouldn't come here again.

 I thought that was strange poop on your collar.

 (moans sadly) Good-bye, Homer Jr.

 I guess you're the man of the house now.

 And never forget, even though the mortgage is due on the first, you can usually wait till the 17th.

 (sobbing) You know what? I think it's fine if Homer spends a few hours now and then with Homer Jr.

 Exactly.

 You always said charity begins at home.

 But not which home.

 It's true, I never specified the home.

  There's a great and a bloody fight   'Round this whole world tonight   And the battle, the bombs and shrapnel reign   Hitler told the world around  He would tear our union down   But our union's gonna break them slavery chains   Our union's gonna break them slavery chains  (tires screeching)  I walked up on a mountain in the middle of the sky   Could see every farm and every town   I could see all the people in this whole wide world   That's the union that'll tear the fascists down, down, down.

  Now to sing you a lullaby my father sung to me.

  Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep   Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep.

  (snoring softly) Oh, man, I really overdid it tonight.

 Late night at Moe's, eh? No, I'm exhausted from  Head, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes.

  It's the toes that get you, Marge.

 It's the toes.

 What about your own children? Way ahead of you, Marge, I'm taking all four of my kids to the zoo tomorrow.

 Three.

 Yes, we'll be back by 3:00.

 Homer has a very tight nap schedule.

 Quit talking about that baby.

 I was talking about myself in the third person.

 Oh.

 We can't take much more of this, Lisa.

 The girls are getting so antsy they'll cheer anything.

 You're the greatest generation, worthy of our veneration.

 Go Grampa! If this is heaven, why don't my shoes match? (doorbell rings) (deep sigh) Okay, I give up.

 I'm gonna do what we secretly did at the Alamo-- surrender.

 (cheering) While you're at it, how about a little boost for peanut vendors? What do you think I'm taking their raise out of? (jabbering happily) I wanted you all to be happy together, so I brought you to the zoo where all the animals live in harmony.

 (growls) (triumphant wail) Okay, guys, I got your ice creams.

 Hey, ah, ah, ah.

 Now, Maggie, we don't hurt each other in this family.

 Are you nuts? You can't even kiss me good night without slicing me with your stubble.

 Why you little I'll give you a good-night kiss you'll never forget.

 Come here, you.

 (grunting) Aah, ooh, ah! Ah! Ow! Yeah! Dad, we're missing the giant capybaras of Uruguay.

 Okay, I know what'll cheer you kids up.

 Seeing me out-monkey the monkeys.

 (hooting like a monkey) (angry hooting, screeching) I have a soul and you guys don't.

 (hooting) Aah! Monkeys! (grunts) (angry grunt) Dad, Maggie's rolling away.

 (gasps) She's heading for Prairie Dog Village.

 If they get her in their warrens, we'll never see her again.

 (chittering) Look, shiny keys.

 Jingle jangle.

 (grunts, laughs) Stupid monkeys.

 That's it, Maggie, use the Dino-Wand.

 This is the last time you'll see that elevator baby.

 I'm sorry, Homer Jr.

 You'll occupy an idealized place in my heart that no one can ever quite fill.

 (Homer sobbing) Therapy, please.

 Me, too.

 Okay, I've got to impart all my fatherly advice in this one walk.

 The sky is blue, but nobody really knows why.

 Don't believe what they tell you.

 Girls are great and terrible at the same time.

 Get used to it.

 And, most importantly Oops, we're here.

 You'll have to figure it out on your own.

 Sorry, little fella.

 One day I'll be that guy who comes to your wedding, makes you feel a little weird, and then runs away.

 Homer, great news.

 Chase came back.

 (whoops) Who's Chase? Homer Jr.

's father.

 Oh, my God, is that my son? You didn't tell me he was a soldier.

 You didn't tell me you were pregnant.

 I didn't want you to marry me because I was pregnant.

 I wanted you to marry me because I was nagging you.

 (fusses) Um, he likes it if you tickle his toes.

 Dude, he's my kid.

 He likes what I like.

 But n-n-n-nurture.

 Gretch, I think he's got my calves.

 He does, baby, he does.

 Can I just say good-bye to him quick? Sure.

 I guess this is it, little guy.

 Da-da.

 (gasps) The most beautiful words a father can hear.

 Da-da.

 Da-da.

 Oh.

 Hey, one day you'll have kids of your own.

 I do.

 Really? Then this is much creepier than I thought.

 Much.

 Shouldn't have bet his door if he didn't want to lose it.

 (sighs) Hi, Maggie.

 If you could talk, I know you'd have a few choice words for me.

 You want me to take care of your dolly? That's the sweetest thing any baby has ever done for me.

 Honey, you know where the bottle opener is? I think it's in the drawer.

 Whoa, little dude.

 Where did you learn that? This is what we're fighting for, babe.

 (marching band playing theme song ) HOMER: Hey, what's this marching band have to do with Homer Jr.

? What?! There were cheerleaders in our house and nobody told me? (Homer moans) and FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY Shh!   


                





                    			 (metronome ticking) (classical music playing) (jazz music playing) (classical music playing) (jazz music playing) (low note blaring) (classical music playing) (chugging) (dramatic classical music playing) (bluesy sax riff plays) (all playing blues) (orchestra playing bluesy song) (whistle blows) (tromping footsteps) (playing rock version of The Simpsons theme song) (jazz music playing) (all playing The Simpsons theme song) (playing jazz version of The Simpsons theme song) (bell ringing, kids cheering)  One is the loneliest number  That you'll ever do  Two can be as bad as one  It's the loneliest number since the number one   No is the saddest experience you'll ever know   Yes, it's the saddest experience you'll ever know  (grunts)  'Cause one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do   One is the loneliest number, worse than two   And one You know, I really think I've made my point.

 (thunder crashes) Oh, the rain has washed away the playground shed! I'm being chased by sports! It's called "precipitation," 'cause it never fails to precipitate unruly behavior.

 (thunder crashes) And saddest of all, those who do not have a friend to play with in the rain, doomed to get only single pneumonia.

 A spit wad? Well, at least I'm getting some attention.

 And the best part is I'm bombarding her with her own homework.

 (laughs) (sighs) (screams) Begone! (hisses) (chuckles) Well, you're never alone surrounded by The Autobiography of Charles Manson? (screams) Hmm.

 Huh? Hi.

 New kid, second grade.

 Don't you love the rain? (gasps) New kid? Uh, have you made any friends? Just Charlotte, Emily and Anne.

 (gasps) That's a reference to the Bronte sisters! (gasps) You got my reference to the Bronte sisters?! Nice to meet you, Lisa Simpson.

 How do you know my name? I deciphered the anagrams on your notebook.

 Oh.

 Be Lisa? (gasps) Isabel! (both giggle) HOMER: Ooh, spaghetti.

 (phone ringing) Y'ello! Lisa, you got a call from someone named Isabel.

 (gasps) May I ask what this is regarding? Ooh! A budding new friendship? Oh! Boy, how come you can't get a new friend? What's wrong with the one I got? I finally got that M&amp;M out of my inner ear.

 I remembered correctly; it was a green one! Don't eat it.

 It's been in his ear.

 Don't eat it.

It's been in his ear.

 Don't eat it.

 It's been in the boy's ear and the dog's mouth.

 Don't eat it.

 Oh, for God's sake! And don't you hate being the middle child? Yeah.

 In the car, I always have to sit on the hump.

 It makes reading impossible.

 MARGE: Lisa, your food's getting cold! It's raw veggies.

 They're supposed to be cold! Well, someone who loves you put melted butter on them! Thank you, Mr.

 Bergstrom.

 I'll tell Lisa you dropped by.

 I better go.

 Okay, but one more thing: I noticed we're both doing presentations on Franklin Roosevelt at school.

 Why don't we do them together? (quietly): Oh, my God.

 Someone wants to be my partner.

 Can't screw this up.

 Downloading, downloading, downloading, downloading, downloading (computer chimes, electronic fanfare plays) Whoo-hoo! (clears throat) Franklin Roosevelt bravely instituted a series of reforms called the New Deal.

 Which ran totally counter to America's tradition of limited government.

 P.

S.

 It was also unconstitutional.

 Oh? Um, FDR's steadfast leadership also helped America win World War Two.

 Until the weak-kneed Democrats sold us out at Yalta.

 If you haven't guessed, Lisa, I'm a Republican.

 A Lincoln Republican? Not really.

 A Reagan Republican? Keep going.

 First President Bush? Getting there.

 Oh, dear God.

 (chuckles) I must say, Lisa, it was amusing to see you thoroughly de-high-horsed.

 That isn't a word.

 Ooh, back on the saddle she climbs.

 I just can't believe someone like you would be a Republican.

 I mean, isn't your last name GutiÃ©rrez? Just what exactly are you saying? I'm just saying that people of your heritage-- which could be any one of many heritages, I'm not pigeonholing Is it a Catholic thing? I'm a non-observant Jew from Argentina.

 Ay, caramba! Do you even know what that means? Uh, there-there's a caramba in my eye? It's the Spanish version of "hot damn.

" Ay, caramba! Hmm? Lisa, is everything okay? Yes.

 Why? Because you're doing your homework and you don't look happy.

 (groans) My new best friend isn't what I thought.

 She's a Republican! (laughs) What is so funny? They're destroying the world! They are, huh? I thought I'd show you this when you were older, but (gasps) You voted for Reagan?! MARGE: It was a crazy time, the '80s.

 You don't hear me listening to the Thompson Twins anymore.

 Although (tape warbles)  Hold me now (humming along) So, you were going through a phase? Mm-hmm.

 All right, '80s party! Where's the beef? Tear down that wall! Because I think the beef is behind that wall! Hmm.

 Hmm.

  You say I'm a dreamer Now get up here, boy! We're gonna do "The Super Bowl Shuffle.

" No! You never let me be Mike Singletary! Fine.

 You're Mike Singletary.

 Enjoy your mediocre coaching career.

  My name is Homer, I'm a real fullback   Gonna run that ball, don't want no flack   If you try to run, you'll get a heart attack  Why you little!  Hey, big man, don't want no trouble   I'm just here to do "The Super Bowl   Shuffle" Excuse me.

 (grunting) People's views change.

 Bobby Kennedy worked for Joe McCarthy.

 Larry David was on Fridays.

 What are you trying to say? Isabel's only eight.

 As she grows up, surprising things will happen to her body of beliefs.

 But she could always use a friend like you.

 Hmm.

 Hmm.

 Isabel? Lisa? Listen, I'm really sorry about No, it's okay.

 My mom says you're just going through a liberal phase.

 What?! My mom says you're going through a conservative phase.

 There's no such thing.

 Conservatives only get more conservative.

 Because every year, they get a little further through Atlas Shrugged.

 Listen, we're both eight years old.

 Can't we just play Monopoly or something? My father owns a monopoly! (whirring) That young filly is exactly the kind of candidate we need to start recruiting! She's a young, dynamic Latina.

 Yee-haw! I said that just right! Without the Hispanic vote, even Texas is poised to turn blue.

 Blue! Yeah, we must reach her and groom her before she fattens up like Chris Christie.

 He thinks GOP stands for "Gravy on Pancakes.

" (laughter) But despite my mirthful remarks, obesity is no laughing matter.

 (chuckles) Just can't resist those words, "sign-up sheet.

" Oh, looks like I'll be running against Isabel.

 And Ralph? Just call me Ralph Nader.

 I don't know why.

 Isabel! I want this campaign to be about the issues: same-sex field trip buddies, providing class pets with a path to citizenship And no digging up past relationships.

 Sure, Lisa and I dated.

 Sure, she broke my heart.

 I'm sure your researchers know all about it.

 This is the first I've heard of it.

 Really? But I got this! Ew.

 How long has it been since you washed your stomach? You can't ask that anymore! (chuckles nervously) Quit shoving! I'd like a word with you, young lady.

 How did you get in there? Slid in through the grates.

 Here's the scoop.

 You're our future, so we can't afford to have you lose.

 And I love the Spanish-- from the Inquisition to the delightful Franco years.

 What are you talking about? Move over! I know how to talk to kids.

 We want to give you a little present.

 A tainted victory that will haunt you forever.

 I'd rather do this myself.

 But who'd own you then? You couldn't buy me with a wheelbarrow full of ice cream.

 Whoa, nicely done.

 You've charmed another one right into the arms of the Libertarian Party.

 Maybe we can help her without her knowing we're helping her.

 No one says I can't buy a second grade election.

 Why, I had enough money to fix People Magazine's Sexiest Man Alive.

 Most of the money went to convincing them that I was alive.

 Who ordered the Yumboni? Right here! Now, Smithers, I want you to eat this for me.

 Describe every taste.

 And don't forget the brain freeze.

 Sir, I am lactose-intolerant.

 And I'm back-talk-allergic! So start eating! (groans) Have a great day, kids.

 And, Bart, I'll pick you up after school to take you to karate lessons.

 Mom, after six weeks, I figured out that Sensei Weinstein is really my psychiatrist.

 Either way, for 45 minutes, you're not my problem, sweetie.

 (horn honking) (gasps) Don't worry, Lisa, despite the paid ad, I am strictly middle of the road.

 Idiot! (horns honking) Pick a lane! (tires screech) Wha?! What are you doing?! I'm as bewildered as you are.

 I don't know why, but the Springfield Republican Party is grooming me.

 Grooming? Yuck! Unfortunately, I can't stop it.

 The Supreme Court says spending money is free speech.

 Well, then you could use your free speech to denounce this intrusion of big money into our election.

 Mm, I'll think about it while I'm on my listening tour of the cafeteria.

 (slurring): Pour me another.

 What are you doing? It's imaginary.

 Fine.

 I got to go.

 I'll see you later.

 (humming a tune) (grunting) Ay, caramba! Bart, I need you to help me win the election.

 I can help, but it's gonna get rough.

 I'm fine with rough.

 You don't know what rough is.

 That ain't rough.

 More like a gentle breeze.

 Maggie hits harder.

 Did the good night pixie just kiss my cheek? Ow! Okay, you got my attention.

 You want to win this election? Then from now on, you do exactly what I say.

 You got it.

 First, go make me five pans of brownies.

 You're just taking advantage of the situation.

 Hmm, maybe Isabel likes baking.

 Cakey or gooey? I'll make both.

 First, we reel them in.

 Then, we scare the hell out of them.

 By discussing the school's budget crisis? No, with balls to the head.

 (blows whistle) Bombardment! I associate Isabel with a pain in my tummy.

 Bombardment? (groans) Miss Simpson, your platform calls for the creation of a student-run garden.

 Organic gardening is an essential part of 21st century education, teaching both hands-on And what programs would you cut to pay for this precious garden of yours? The new Wiffle bats? Pizza Friday? (gasps) Not Pizza Friday! Sorry, Lisa, you lose again.

 (air horn blares) You got to get on your game, sister.

 You think I'm tough? Wait till GutiÃ©rrez sinks her teeth into you.

 Remember, you got an ace in the hole: chocolate milk in the water fountains.

 That's impossible.

 We've already had the best plumbers in the city look into it.

 Hey, we'll worry about that after you're elected.

 (groaning) (whistling) What are you so happy about? It's in the bag, Lis.

 Once everybody sees this.

 Training wheels.

 She still uses training wheels.

 (snickers) And watch this.

 (crying) Excellent.

 What am I doing? Untent! Untent! Oh, Bart, I want to win, but not like this.

 I'm sorry, you're fired.

 Leave the bottle.

 I bet by the end of the night, you're gonna look pretty good.

 Welcome to our first in a series of 37 debates-- good Lord-- before the elementary school elections.

 You're a booger head! And I say we move beyond name-calling to solve our real problems.

 (all booing) Booger head! Vote for whoever you want to.

 To me, these are both losers.

 Now, the second grade debate between Isabel GutiÃ©rrez and Lisa Simp-a-son.

 Sounds weird.

 Mm.

 ISABEL: Ivy Agee, Frank Marino, Glen Gloyd.

 These are men who fought at Omaha Beach.

 And they are the reason I'm running for second grade rep.

 Dios los bendiga a todos.

 (students cheering) I'll bet my bologna sandwich that girl's gonna win.

 Oh, a little rich for my blood, sir.

 Yes, you can fog a mirror, Seymour, but I wouldn't call you alive.

 Now, the other candidate, Lisa Simpson.

 Okay, I'm a liberal.

 And sometimes that's a dirty word.

 (laughter) Liberal.

 But what liberal really means is someone who believes that those who have more than enough should share a little with those who don't.

 And those principles have consistently been in place during this country's most prosperous times.

 So if that's a liberal, then I am a liberal.

 And hang me.

 (screams) Sorry, we're just setting up for An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.

 (groaning) Ooh.

 The Democratic Party pantheon.

 Such lofty ideals.

 (gasps) And here come the spirits.

 Michael Dukakis, Walter Mondale, John Kerry? These are all losers! I'm afraid you're heading for a loss, Lisa.

 And when we lose, we lose big.

 What about Obama? Harry Truman? Bill Clinton? Lisa, you're a lot like me.

 Play the saxophone, come from a small town, raised by a mother with no help.

 So, do you know how I can win? I don't even know why I'm a ghost.

 All these guys are alive.

 John Kerry here is Secretary of State.

 Doing a bang-up job.

 Well, we still have a long way to go on Asian currency issues.

 Absolutely.

 And, Lisa, I'm only appearing in this dream so I can visit with you about the Clinton Global Initiative.

 See, our mission is to turn ideas into action.

 And to find innovative solutions that will hel (snoring) Hey, hey, hey! You can't fall asleep in a dream! (snoring) (groans) I know what I've got to do.

 Hello, Isabel? Listen (snores) (groaning) CGI also convenes CGI America, a meeting devoted to economic recovery and job creation.

 You used to be fun! Kevin Costner used to be a movie star.

 Get over it.

 And now for their final debate, please welcome, uh, Li um Li-sa? Li-sa, uh, Simpsone.

 Yes.

 And, uh, Isabel Adolpho-Guzman-Lopez GutiÃ©rrez.

 Uh, ladies.

 (grunts) I just want to say, I don't care about politics, electioneering or negative campaigning.

 If my friend Lisa wins, so be it.

 (speaks Spanish) (cheering) And I also want to say that if Time's up.

 But I Stop showboating.

 (grunts) Back in the banner shed you go.

 SKINNER: Good morning.

 We have completed the tally of the votes for class representative.

 One brief announcement: the tainted Greek salad has given several students nightmares involving Michael Dukakis.

 It may recur tonight, so if possible, have your parents strap you to the bed.

 And now the results.

 First grade rep-- results delayed indefinitely due to jelly on the ballots.

 Second grade rep-- Isabel GutiÃ©rrez.

 (grunts) Third grade rep, no votes cast.

 Congratulations, Isabel.

 Fourth grade rep-- last name Weiner, first name Ima I truly hope you enjoy the Friday morning council meetings.

 Simpson! (crying): And the-the free snicker doodle cookies.

 Smithers, we won! Drop the balloons! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Can I at least remove the balloons? Do it and you'll kill him.

 (groans) Hey, Lis.

 Hey.

 I'm sorry I fired you.

 Eh, no hard feelings.

 A lot of good things have been happening to me.

 Mm-hmm.

 Thanks, Bart.

 I think you might feel better if you looked at these exit polls.

 They find me a pointy-haired know-it-all.

 Yes, but they agreed with everything you said.

 What are you getting at? for a liberal.

 Just not you.

 Huh.

 You hear that, world? They love my ideas, just not me! And that is half the battle! Ha! Hello, I'm elder Anderson Cooper.

 Welcome to our first debate between Republican Isabel GutiÃ©rrez and Lisa Simpson, representing the Democratic Robot Zombie Coalition.

 First question: Ms.

 Simpson, what would you do to get America out of Afghanistan? I'd just throw in the towel and make it a state.

 That's our girl.

 (toots twice) and FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY Shh!   


                





                    			 (exclaiming) (school bell ringing) (Barney belches) (tires screeching) D'oh! (tires screeching) (grunts) (groaning) (laughs)  Skinner!   Skinner  He patrols the school halls  Skinner!   When you spit, he's got the balls   As you mosey through the school   All the kids say you're so cool   And you even made  Bart Simpson spill his milk  Skinner!   Skinner  You're the master  Of your fate! Skinner!  Skinner  You sure look good in chaps   Skinner Wake up.

 You're on! (grunts) Children, I have some exciting news.

 (kids murmuring) I'm here to tell you about a field trip so amazing, we've put "sign here" stickers on the permission slips.

 As you recall, these stickers came from last year's field trip to the "sign here" sticker factory.

 But thanks to my old navy buddy-- we both love to shop at Old Navy-- the students of this school will be taking a ride on a nuclear-powered, attack-class submarine, the USS Tom Clancy! (all gasp) (chuckles) So you're all excited, eh? ALL: Yay! Well, that's too bad, because many of you will not be going.

 ALL: Huh?! There's limited room on the submarine, so only the best-behaved students-- as determined by me-- will go on the trip.

 Whoo-hoo! Well, I get to go! To increase the tension, everyone starts with a clean slate.

 But from this moment on I am the law.

 I hold the red pen.

  Skinner!  Pranks, inside use of outside voice, off-color whistling, and you're stricken from the list.

 And once crossed off, you stay crossed off.

 That's what pens do.

 (gulps) (bees buzzing) Help! I'm trapped in space with a man I don't like! BART: Aooga! Submerge! Periscope! Aooga! Aooga! Die, Nazi octopus, die! (makes explosion sound) Sweetie, about the submarine what's your favorite food to eat when you're disappointed? I'm going shopping tomorrow.

 Ice cream sandwiches.

 Why? What your mother is trying to say is we don't think you can be good that long.

 Mom, is that true? Well, that's sort of what I was trying to say, but What your mother is trying to say is No, you're wrong! You're all wrong! I didn't say anything.

 Were you thinking it? Yes.

 Get real, ding-dong! You've already done so much bad stuff, Skinner's never gonna let you on that boat.

 No, Skinner said I had a clean slate, so right now, I'm as good as any other kid.

 (Homer and Lisa laughing) Good one, ding-dong.

 Mom! Don't listen to them.

 They're the ding-dongs.

 Wha?! Bart, sweetie, this is an opportunity for you to turn things around yet again.

 And I believe in you.

 Yet again.

 Thanks, Mom.

 I'll start by taking my plate to the dishwasher.

 Wherever that is.

 (cupboards open, shut, dish breaks) Pfft.

 Marge, I love Bart as much as you do, but actually not.

 And that kid cannot go one week without getting in trouble.

 Now, if you'd be so kind as to start my car for me, I'm going to Moe's.

 (blowing air) Ooh.

 (engine starts) Thank you.

 (tires squeal) Whoo-hoo! Mm-hmm.

 Mm-hmm! What are you doing? To avoid temptation, I'm getting rid of all the things that could get me in trouble at school.

 I buried all my whoopee cushions in the backyard.

 (flatulence sounds) Hmm? (groans) What the? That's not where I buried them.

 Come on! Don't take my custom limo! At least let me sniff my coke out of the floor mats! (grunts) (sniffing) (bicycle bell dings) Oh, hi, little girl.

 What brings you to see Uncle Krusty? (chuckles) Krusty, are you broke? Yeah.

 All it takes is some bad luck at the ponies, worse luck in the Bitcoin market, heavy investment in a high-end bookmark company.

 You could do what Everybody Loves Raymond did.

 Go off the air while I'm still good? That horse has left the stable, gone to the glue factory and has been used to make art projects.

 I mean, you could sell foreign rights to your show.

 Even SpongeBob did it.

 Buon compleanno, Squiduardo! No, no, no, Roberto! E 'una mina della seconda guerra mondiale, che farÃ  saltare in aria e Ah! Calamari?! No! (sobbing) No! Uh it's cute stuff, but I'm still broke, girlie.

 Not my Monet! I only looked at it once! What I'm saying is, you could produce foreign versions of your TV show with actors from other countries.

 Okay, I'll do it! Not my Shetland dolphin! Although I won't miss the constant yapping.

 Papa! Not anymore, he ain't.

 (booming thud) Gum on the floor.

 Off the list.

 Unauthorized meat-a-pult.

 Off the list! Lips touching the fountain.

 Off the list.

 It's not my fault there's no water pressure.

 Excuses are like handkerchiefs; everybody's got one.

 I don't have a handkerchief.

 Off the list! Firm but fair, sir.

 Don't want any troublemakers on our submarine.

 Not bad, Simpson.

 Did you wash your knees? Front and back, sir.

 You're like egg salad at a picnic, Simpson.

 Even when you look good, we know you're going bad.

 Principal Skinner? I object to this arbitrary use of power and request I be taken off the list.

 Off the list! Thank you.

 Oh, man! Five days without pranking? I'm getting strange red marks.

 But I'm gonna make it! (engine backfiring) Uh-oh.

 (alarms buzzing) Something's wrong with my long yellow car.

 (starter chugs) Any of you kids got a Triple A card? What? No.

 I'll be late.

 Skinner will cross my name off the list.

 (grunts) All fixed up! (horn honks) (tires screech, horn drones) (school bell rings) (laughs, hums triumphantly) Off the list.

 For what? Muddy footprints on the school floor.

 (gasps) I've broken a ten-year-old's spirit.

 Time to celebrate with a fruit- on-the-bottom yogurt.

 Plain, plain, plain, plain Mmm! Fruit! No, Mother, I did not use any of your talc.

 I don't know why the bottle feels lighter.

 Maybe you're just getting stronger! Some days I could just kill you.

 (phone rings) She heard me.

 Hello? BART (nasally voice): Hold for the president.

 OBAMA (on spliced recording): This is Barack Obama! Is this a prank? OBAMA: No.

 (gasps) That's offensive.

 (gasps) I want to talk about submarines and trips.

 Simpson has to go.

 Simpson has to go on the submarine.

 On the submarine.

 Of course.

 (tweeting) This is Barack Obama!  So in love with you I like Ohio State You can put lipstick on a pig  So in love with you Welcome.

 Welcome, foreign-market Krustys.

 If you examine your "Krusty Kit," you're gonna find unremovable green hair dye, a used red nose and a guidebook on how to capture a monkey.

 But now, the man they call Mr.

 Monday Afternoon Krusty! Hey-hey! Hai-hai! Hu-hu! Heil-heil! Rodgrod med Flode! Now, there are many words for what I'm looking for-- rubles, renminbi, baht-- but they all mean money, which rhymes with funny, which you can be if you want.

 I don't care.

 Just do the Krusty show in your country and send me ten percent.

 Then send me another 60%.

 Then five percent more, and you're good.

 Nice job, Simpson.

 You even got my Suze Orman tape unstuck from the cassette player.

 She's the reason I was able to purchase a new watch band.

 Always bragging about his watch band.

 If only I could tell time.

 Okay, I washed your car like you asked, I did your paper route, and I'm sorry.

 I really am.

 This could be the turning point of my life.

 Where you, as a school guy, made a difference.

 What do you think? Can I go on that sub? Sorry, Simpson.

 Take her down.

 KIDS: Yay! RALPH: Yay! NELSON: Yippee! MILHOUSE: Poor Bart.

 Rasta hey-hey, on the left-hand side.

 (laughs) As my mother used to say, "Wanti wanti can't get it, getti getti no want it.

" Now here's Itchem and Scratchem, mon.

 (laughs) (cheering)  They smoke  They toke  They smoke and toke and smoke   Ha!  Smoke, smoke, smoke  Toke, toke, toke  The Itchem and Scratchem Blow.

   Eye and eye say good-bye.

 The blessings of Jah upon you all.

 Nice.

 You're a hit all over the world.

 There's Chinese Krusty with Sideshow Mao.

 Even Irish Krusty.

 Me ma, she had 12 children, but only three lived.

 Then they closed the mill.

 (chuckles sadly) Hey-hey.

 (Irish flute plays melancholy tune) And it's all thanks to you, kid.

 To show my appreciation, I'm gonna bring you with me next time I entertain the troops.

 Warning: they're not American troops.

 (slurps) Hello, boy.

 At times like this, there's not much you can say, especially if you don't know what happened.

 (sobs) Skinner didn't let me go.

 Really? Hey, I bet that submarine isn't so fun anyway.

 (sniffs) You think so? Fire that torpedo, Milhouse.

 Aye, aye.

 Where'd it go? It was just imaginary.

 I know a kid should never turn to his father for help, but I got screwed.

 Is there anything you can do? As I always say, don't get mad; get dinner.

 Then get even.

 With Skinner.

 You'll really help me get revenge? Yes.

 What's Skinner's weakness? Everything.

 Good.

 We can use that.

  Skinner!   Skinner   You are feeling pretty smug   Skinner!   Sipping cocoa from a mug   When you've reached the mountaintop   Your next step is a drop.

  No, no, no, no, no!  Skinner!  (knocking) I'll be right there.

 Just saying good-bye to Mother.

 (imitates Mother): Seymour, I'm going out for a walk.

 Uh-huh, see you in several months at the soonest.

 (knocking continues) We have a problem, Seymour.

 I did everything for you and you stabbed me in the back.

 Wait a minute, I knew you were a neat freak, Skinner, but you beat your rug till it bleeds? (gasps) All right, I'll come clean.

 I woke up and, surprisingly, Mother wasn't there beside me.

 She was dead.

 Still, I can't be sure I killed her.

 Well, I'm sure our town's police force will handle this competently.

 Now, I could investigate further, but you don't want to sit in a jail all weekend.

 Chief, that was awfully arbitrary.

 Not compared to this.

 (groans) Let me handle this.

 Just go upstairs and shut the door.

 There are some things only a boy should see.

 (door closes) (both laugh) (cackles) Now do you want to dispose of this jelly-soaked pillow? Just call me The Cleaner.

 (slurps) Um, where's the body? She's in a better place.

 (chain saw rumbling) The deed is done.

 Oh, I wish you'd asked me before you Look, you kill them, I get rid of them.

 That's always been our deal.

 But I do have one question: Do you want the head? No, no, God, no.

 Well, if you change your mind, it'll be in my freezer.

 But only for a week.

 Got a lot of ice cream coming in.

 Ugh, if this were a movie, Mother wouldn't let me watch it.

 Now, I'm afraid it's time to start your new life.

 You'll be hunted, on the run, searching for the man who killed your mother, which is you.

 So avoid mirrors.

 (Krusty humming) Krusty, I have some very bad news.

 The foreign Krustys are all hotter than you.

 Irish Krusty's got a show on Broadway.

 Oi, where's your monkey? There never was a monkey.

 I was just tellin' stories to forget me consumption.

 (coughs) (applause) Well, you see there, they need to hit the word "monkey" harder if they want to get a laugh.

 Don't you get what I'm trying to tell you? You are now the least popular Krusty in the world.

 What about Romanian Krusty? What, you mean President-for-Life Krusty? (low groan) I still get a piece, right? Putz.

 You're the least successful version of you there is.

 A piece.

 Now, let's see where this goes.

 Irish Krusty, this is your baby.

 The only thing working round here is your libido.

 Now I know why Ma walked into the sea with her pockets full of rocks, on Christmas.

 Why doesn't this material work for me? Seymour, the cops are on their way.

 (siren wails) Here's a bus ticket to Juarez and your fake I.

D.

 SKINNER: Oh, come on, I don't look anything like this "Dick Fiddler.

" No, you don't yet.

 I don't want to sound ungrateful, but could I eat one of the potatoes? Sorry, but Dick Fiddler is allergic to potatoes.

 I understand.

 (both giggling) Dad? Thanks for sticking up for me.

 (laughs) Someday I may have to fake my own death.

 And maybe you can help me with that.

 Sure, Dad.

 Someday soon.

 As in, what are you doing this Friday? Aah! Dick Fiddler! Gentlemen, I can't run away from what I've done.

 I accept that I killed my mother.

 My whole life, she's belittled me.

 Maybe deep down, I'm glad.

 This has gone far enough.

 I'm starting to think this "school project" is more than meets the eye.

 Mother? You're alive? Seymour, when this fat guy and his kid asked me to fake my death to punish you, I said, "Sure, that's something to do.

" You know, when you glare like that, you look really beautiful.

 (grumbles): Mm-hmm.

 But when I just heard you say you were glad to see me dead I thought, "Now I'm gonna be meaner to you than ever.

" How is that possible? I've stopped taking those pills that keep me nice.

 (gasps)  Fiddler!   Fiddler, you look stupid   In that beard   Fiddler!   This dream is getting weird.

  KRUSTY: So I heard many of you are dissatisfied with my 75% cut of your take.

 Well, we did consider letting you keep more.

 (cheering) But instead, we're giving you something even better.

 I will do a guest shot on each of your shows.

 Huh? Eh? (jeering, shouting) Twist him like a balloon.

 Cut off his hey-heys.

 Let's slice him up and cook him in our traditional dishes.

 Krusty, can't you think of something? I'm very bad in a crisis.

 I also can't ad-lib, memorize anything, improv or tell a joke.

 Uh, you know, why did you even become a clown? Well, I was supposed to be one of the sad ones.

 and FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY  They smoke, they toke  They smoke and toke and smoke   Ha!  Smoke, smoke, smoke  Toke, toke, toke  The Itchem and Scratchem Blow   Ha! Shh!

 Mouse! (screams) (listless): Hey-hey.

 Due to modern sensitivity, we've been asked to block any violent images that appear in this children's cartoon.

 Oh, my God! I never watched one of these sober! I gotta get this bloodbath off my kids' show! (grunts) KRUSTY: Damn it! Aw, geez, when did everything turn to crap? Bart, don't use language like that.

 MARGE: Man, things sure have turned to crap.

 (Homer humming) Homer, you have to take the Halloween decorations down before you put the Christmas ones up.

 Marge, to that I say, boo, humbug.

 (hissing) There's a new Grinch this holiday season, and its name is "global warming.

" Meteorologists warn there'll be no snow this Christmas anywhere in America, not even in Alaska, where the Eskimos now have a hundred words for "nothing.

" Global warming.

 Huh.

 By pure coincidence, every scientist was right.

 But it's not all doom and gloom.

 Illegal poachers are having a field day.

  80 degrees, water won't freeze   God help us, please, no one's on skis   Happy, happy, happy, happy hunting  (owls hooting)  Happy, happy, happy, happy hunting.

  (worried moaning) (Marge sighs) Sorry, kids, I guess the hats and mittens will have to wait until next year.

 Oh! Oh! (humming) Hmm? Snow? (laughs) Snow! (both gasp) Oh, you know what this means, kids? (both gasp) I don't have to pick up the dog poops! (sobbing) Uh, so you see, the "snow" is a microclimate aberration caused by radioactive steam from the nuclear plant and, of course, tire fire particulate.

 So, we're the only place in America with snow, if you can call it that.

 I guess you can.

 Don't you idiots see what this means?! Idiots? Why do we reelect this guy? 'Cause his opponent has a long Slavic name.

 (crowd grumbling) Who want bumper sticker? People, Springfield is now the only town in America that has snow this Christmas.

 So tourists are going to want to come here.

 Stay in our hotels! Slurp our spaghetti.

 Die in our hospitals.

 (chuckles) I say we welcome our winter tourists with open arms, then gouge the hell out of 'em! Who? Who will gouge with me? I, too, will gouge! Duff Beer is proud to make a corporate commitment to gouging! (cheering) Here come the tourists.

 Man your ATMs.

 Yar.

 (both chuckle) (belches) Why would a robot need mittens? Why would a little boy need an aspirin? I don't know.

 (grunts) The one thing Bongo Comics are good for.

 (groans) Are you okay, Chief? (panicky): I'll be fine, I'll be fine.

 God, I bent down to pick up a piece of candy and rolled down a hill.

 You always think it's the other guy that'll turn into a giant snowball.

 Never you.

 Have you seen Lou? LOU: There's snow in my lungs! Lot of attitude in that hand, Lou.

 Lot of attitude.

 (horns honking, Marge groans) Look at all these out-of-state license plates.

 "First in Freeways," "The 'Yuh-Huh' State," "Jewel of the Fracking Belt"? "Still a British Colony at Heart," "Land of Many Water Snakes"? (Marge groaning) Valet parking, five dollars.

 (tires screeching, horn honks) Oh (gasps) People, I'm completely out of milk! I do have several DVDs of the movie Milk, an inspiring return to form for director Gus Van Sant.

 Uh, do you have Life of Pi? No, but I have some home movies of me on a canoe with a big dog.

 People who have never seen a movie say it is a good movie.

 Mmm? (sighs) We can't afford Christmas.

 And when you can't afford Christmas, you've failed as a family.

 (voice breaks): That's what all the big stores say.

 Excuse me, ma'am.

 I'm so sorry to bother you, but my kids are exhausted and the town is sold out.

 Is there any chance you'd have a spare room for us? Well, there's a rec room off the kitchen, but sometimes it's there and sometimes it isn't.

 Our house is very odd that way.

 Please? Please, ma'am? We'd pay you $300 a night.

 Well, you seem like a nice, pushy stranger.

 Ma'am, because we talk this way, people always think that we're, um Uh, what is that word, honey? Passive-aggressive.

 Right, right, but we're not.

 Please, please take our money and everybody wins.

 (Homer humming) Hmm? Oh, good.

 Marge remarried after I died.

 Wait a minute.

 I'm not dead.

 What's going on?! These are our new boarders.

 Uh-uh.

 No way.

 I'm not sharing my bed with anybody except you.

 And maybe that guy.

 Lincoln-style.

 But that's it.

 This is a great thing.

 We're helping people celebrate Christmas, and we'll be able to afford Christmas.

 Oh, I don't know.

 It won't seem like Christmas without opening up a giant credit card bill in January.

 Take a look at this.

 HOMER: What the? "The Simpson Bed and Breakfast"? (chuckles) I always wanted to stay in a place like this.

 But Christmas is a special time.

 And I like to spend it in the warm embrace of watching football.

 Homer Simpson, ask yourself, W.

W.

B.

J.

D.

? Huh? What would Baby Jesus do? (The Beach Boys' "Merry Christmas, Baby" begins)  My baby she told me she don't want to hold me   And kiss my lips anymore  She's gonna leave me  And she don't believe me  That I'll be true now  Well, maybe she don't love me   And is not thinkin' of me  But why'd she do it this time of year?   Doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo   She knows that I'll miss her and I'll want to kiss her   If just for Christmas  Merry Christmas Well, this crazy scheme is the kind of impulsive behavior I want to encourage in you.

 Mmm I'm in! 100%! Oh, thank you.

 Now, Homie, table three needs more bread.

 I'm on a break.

 (groans) (groaning) (groans) Welcome to our day care center.

 All girls, please move to cootie quarantine.

 We've got a two-month-old.

 Are you sure you can handle her? Just don't lose this claim ticket.

 That church doesn't look very inspiring.

 What a bland marquee.

 It doesn't look very inviting.

 (indistinct chatter) This whole crowd's gonna be at my sermon today.

 Darling, did St.

 Paul worry about the crowds? Oh, he wrote letters.

 Any fool can write letters.

 (sighs) Lord, I'm just a small-town minister.

 We don't have Mormon money.

 But if you could see your way to guiding my fingers as I type this sermon Oh, yeah.

 Oh, this is black-church good.

 My friends (feedback drones, congregation groaning) When he starts with "my friends," it's always bad.

 (sighs) Friends, every year, I tell you this holiday is about the birth of our Lord, not singing Santas and full stockings.

 (all murmuring) You're losing us! Christmas is not about what happened in a manger some 2,000 years ago.

 It is about what you do for others now.

 Oh! (all murmuring) Get my the church bulletin.

 Lovejoy's on fire.

 Christmas is the Holy Spirit.

 Ooh, I didn't know there were doves in there.

 Give with your hearts! Give with your acts! And you will know the true meaning of Christmas.

 (congregation gasping) (oohing and aahing) Wow, what a showman.

 (cheering, whooping) I haven't felt this inspired since the blueberries at breakfast.

 Daddy, permission for a religious fit? A brief one.

 (speaking in tongues) I said a fit, not a fervor.

 That sermon really inspired me.

 This whole Christmas has been about money.

 (bell jingling) Oh, are you with the Salvation Army? What makes you think that? (clink) Bless you.

 (laughs) But I'm gonna give gifts that aren't expensive and come from the heart.

 I don't know.

 Christmas didn't get to be the number one holiday by being about love.

 Um, when a woman talks, she just wants to be heard.

 (groans) MARGE (groans): Where's the end? (gasps, groans) Hey, Marge, we're running out of chestnuts over here.

 Well, they don't grow on trees.

 Uh, yeah, they do.

 Oh.

 What about our romantic carriage ride through the snow? Setting it up.

 I don't think you're giving them what they were promised, Dad.

 The secret is: Don't read the comment cards.

 Where do the people sit? I thought they were just gonna watch me.

 Excuse me.

 This eggnog is terrible.

 All eggnog is terrible.

 Those stockings are not hung by the chimney with care.

 Why did I do this for money? Why did I do this for money? And the Christmas special on your television is one of the worst.

 ANNOUNCER: We now return to King Winter Feasts On His Children.

 By the time Princess Summer comes to save you, you'll all be blood in my beard.

 Ho, ho, ho, ho.

 Your own father's beard.

 (King Winter cackling) How long to see Santa? How would I know? I'm an accountant.

 I imagine for small business, huh? God, I hate Christmas.

 Huh? Mr.

 Flanders, where's your store? Well, I'm down to a kiosk, thanks to that place.

 Actually, half a kiosk.

 Sharing it with Nasreen here.

 No cream is finer than mall kiosk cream.

 J.

Lo use it.

 No, thanks.

 It is no wonder you are not married.

 Flip me back.

 If I have to give presents, I'll give presents with a purpose.

 One for Maggie.

 Check.

 All that's left is Bart.

 No.

 No.

 No.

 No, no, no Ah, perfect.

 GUESTS:  All from Satan's power  As we were gone astray  Oh, tidings  Of comfort and joy  In Bethlehem, in Israel this blessed babe was born  Enough.

 Stop.

 Christmas carols only have one verse.

 Well, they may have more, but the second verse is where they get all weird and religiousy.

 Uh, more wassail, please.

 And don't skimp on the aromatic bitters.

 For your information, Gloria, my wassail is just Gatorade I put in the microwave.

 (both gasp) I drank that under the mistletoe.

 It's not mistletoe, just cherries and lettuce.

 Oh! I thought when I ate it, it wasn't poisonous.

 I've opened up my house to you and all you do is fill this joyous season with petty complaints.

 Ho, ho, ho.

 Not now.

 Take out that pillow and put it in room three.

 (sighs) The pillow acted as a girdle.

 Any more questions? Uh, yes, will the pudding be figgy? The pudding will be Jell-O.

 Quite so.

 I'm going to sulk in my room.

 The only thing good about this place is the piano player.

 (coins rattle)  (gasps) An Angelica Button wizard robe.

 With wand pocket.

 And wand.

 (gasps) Professor Digglesby's wand.

 Now I have every wizarding stick from the Spells and Potions Department of Wagglepoofs Academy.

 Don't make me learn about it.

 I know this Christmas has been a little rocky, even for the Simpsons, but I think these gifts born of thought and love will restore the balance of prajna and samsara.

 I mean holly and jolly.

 Now, Dad, I'd like to give you your present.

 You got me weed? Even better.

 They're bags of seeds.

 So that you can plant a garden and watch it grow.

 That's great, sweetie.

 After all that time and hard work, I'll have radishes?! It's the most hated part of salad, which is the most hated part of dinner.

 Radishes, nothing but radishes.

 Dad, stop.

 What? I'm saving them from the struggle of life.

 Well, at least you're eating vegetables.

 Vegetables?! Okay, Bart, open your present.

 It's the one I'm most excited about.

 Plastic bubbling vomit, plastic bubbling vomit.

 What? Lis, you're smart.

 Why would you give me a book? 'Cause it's easy to wrap? Nothing is easy to wrap.

 I have trouble with scissors.

 (sobs) (guests murmuring) Marge, the brochure promised us a happy Christmas.

 My uncle died in your bed.

 Merry Christmas.

 (yawns) What? (gasps) N.

C.

 Wyeth.

 (huge gasp) These are book illustrations.

 Stop it! Stop it! Why in the world would you burn a book? Actually, the idea to do this came from a book.

 Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury? What? No, I got it from this.

 MILHOUSE: See? How could you burn the present I gave you? Because it's my present.

 Did you give it to me because you thought I'd like it or because you wanted to feel better about yourself? Children, perhaps it's time that I explain the true meaning of Christmas.

 HOMER: Shut up, Flanders.

 Okily-dokily.

 Now, did you check the room to make sure you haven't left anything? All set.

 Need directions or a bottle of water? No, thanks.

 We're fine.

 Thank you, sir.

 (clears throat) Oh, right, we're still doing that.

 Come on.

 I'll drive you to the airport.

 Where are my keys? Oh, right in here.

 Bart, you were right.

 If you smell your farts in a dream, you die? No, about Christmas.

 So I went out this morning and I got you this.

 It's a tablet with books on it, but also apps, like Worms With Friends.

 (muffled grumbling) Wow.

 But how'd you afford it? I sold the gift you gave me.

 Get the twist? Obviously.

 You're saying it's from Maggie, but actually it's from you.

 Thanks, Lis.

 Now, why don't you donate that to whatever hopeless cause you want.

 Thanks, Bart.

 This will make a lot of arctic loons very happy.

 (Marge groans) Uh, listen, I just wanted to say I'm sorry I overreacted.

 Thank you all for coming.

 Yeah, well, we have something to say to you, Marge.

 (groans)  We wish you a merry Christmas   We wish you a merry Christmas   We wish you a merry Christmas   And a happy New Year.

  Good tidings we bring No second verses.

 They creep me out.

 Okay, we'll sing a different one.

  Good King Wenceslas looked out   On the feast of Stephen Oh, that one creeps me out from the beginning.

  When the snow lay round about   Deep and crisp and even (loud whirring) Oh, the happy sound of a blender.

 and FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY Shh!   


                





                    			 (crow squawks) Oh, boy.

 Monday morning chit-chat at the water cooler.

 The only reason to have done stuff over the weekend.

 The only part of the movie I didn't get is: now Radioactive Man gets his powers from his suit? The suit is slowly killing him, but if he doesn't wear it, he'll die.

 Oh Wait, you guys saw the new Radioactive Man sequel? Uh, it's not a sequel, it's a reboot.

 Actually, this one undoes the stuff from the last one, so it's a de-boot.

 Stop talking! I haven't seen it yet! Radioactive Man Re-Rises came out three days ago.

 It is fair game.

 Yeah, if you haven't seen it, then you gotta leave the water cooler.

 But what if I want some cooled water? You should have thought of that when you were not seeing the movie.

 Fine.

 I'll drink alone.

 (grunts) It was so awesome when Radioactive Man had to erase his own memory.

 Yeah, so he wouldn't be tortured by his past when he was born in the future.

 Oh, they're talking about the movie! Hurry up, you idiot! No, no, don't stop! I'm sorry I got mad.

 I'll do that thing you like.

 I got Radioactive Man's new villain the Collider.

 I turn out to be a good guy.

 I die, but come back to life after the credits.

 Oh! Sometimes we feel there's nowhere left to turn, much like Radioactive Man, when he had to kill his own antimatter twin with a blast of time particles from the Chrono-cube -  Amazing grace  How loud I sing and in doing so, mortally wounding  To drown the spoilers out! his girlfriend, who was pregnant with his own  Shut up, shut up, shut  (yells) And stay out! HOMER: Okay.

 I gotta go see the Radioactive Man movie before it gets totally ruined for me.

 Ooh, date night! I'll go change my bra.

 I want to see Radioactive Man Re-Rises.

 If Bart's going, I'm going! If Grampa's going, I'm going! If you all go, then I have to pay for a babysitter.

 We'll call that nice girl who's getting her Masters in Child Development.

 Emily-Beth? We can't afford Emily-Beth! She brings her own puppets! (cooing) Bye-bye, Maggie! Bye-bye, money.

 Two adults, two kids, and one senior with the mind of a baby so he should be free.

 For the 3-D show, that'll be $72.

 What?! Or, for ten dollars more, you can see it in IMAX Hobbit Frame Rate Virtual Reality Vision.

 (moviegoers shuddering) (vomits) All right, movie, you better be worth it.

 (dramatic music plays) (engines revving) (dancers screaming) HOMER: The motorcycle dudes are chicks! I wonder what else is chicks? (women gasping)  Don't ask.

 Do smell.

 ANNOUNCER: Also available in "Arctic Slut," "Morning After Melon" and "Elon Musk.

" Hey they tricked us! That's a commercial! If I wanted to pay for commercials I can't skip, I'd sign up for Hulu Plus! Shh! You're shushing me? This guy's on his cell phone, she's texting, he's sexting, and that guy brought a baby to a 9:00 movie! (Spanish accent): That's negative, man.

 What happened to the movies? First they got worse than TV, and now this! (all gasping) (yelling) And stay out! (Homer moans) Chins up, Homer.

 You don't need a theater to watch the movie.

 You just have to illegally download it.

 Illegally download it? Is that legal? Who knows? But it sure is easy.

 I'll walk you through it.

 All you have to do is ANNOUNCER: The FOX network forbids the broadcast of step-by-step instructions for illegally downloading copyrighted intellectual property.

 In the meantime, please enjoy this footage from NASCAR's 2011 Martinsville Cup.

 (engines roaring) Wow, that was easy.

 All I had to do was click on (engines roaring) And play!  Bless you, boy.

 That was the greatest thing I've seen on a computer that I can talk about with you in the room.

 How did you know how to do that? I'm under 30.

 Guys, guys, I saw the Radioactive Man movie! Here's my ten favorite scenes from worst to best.

 Number ten: when what's-his-name did that stuff with those dudes.

 Number nine Uh, Homer, that movie's been talked out.

 We're discussing the new James Bond flick.

 I like that James Bond is ugly now.

 I like that he doesn't have any gadgets.

 I like that he's not good at shooting, doesn't say funny quips, or do any James Bond stuff.

 Shut up, shut up, shut up! Homer, go to the theater and see the movie.

 (scoffs) Theaters? All I need to see this movie is a laptop and a Web site based in a country that's really just an offshore oil platform.

 Care to join me?  That was so much better than the cinema.

 It mixes the wonder of movie-going with the rush of stealing.

 All we want is brand-new, big budget entertainment in our homes for nothin'.

 Why doesn't Hollywood get that? Gentlemen, I am inspired to create a theater for the people an experience free of all the nuisances and gouging of modern-day moviegoing! Yeah, no more jerks talking on their cell phones! No more jerks telling me not to talk on my cell phone! And best of all we'll never have to sit through another annoying commercial again! Welcome to "Cinema Pirate-diso.

" Tonight's movie is Life is Funny, directed by Judd Apatow.

 It's based on his life, starring his family and ad-libbed by his friends.

 So for the next three and a half hours, enjoy! (frustrated groan) Did you just pass gas while we were making love? You're the one who hired the Korean taco truck for our private school fund-raiser.

 (chuckles) I live it, he writes it.

  Well, what did you think? We may be going to Hell for seeing "side bosom," but this backyard is a little slice of Heaven, all thanks to Homer Simpson! (cheering) This is fun! And it was so nice of the movie company to let you show their film.

 Let me? Uh, sweetheart, I downloaded it off the Internet illegally.

 An illegal download? But Hollywood says stealing from Hollywood is wrong.

 (scoffs) Why should a regular guy like me have to spend so studios can pay huge salaries to the Air Buds and Ray Liottas of the world? Oh! When I watched that pirated movie, I was stealing with my eyes.

 So I'm repaying the good people in Hollywood for the ticket I should have bought.

 Now this money will end up in the hands of the talented people who make magic happen on the silver screen.

 (inhales) Ah (startled gasp) Karen, get me the FBI! Karen! You people joined this squad for one reason: to fight movie pirates.

 I wanted to catch serial killers.

 (mocking, whiny tone): "I wanted to catch serial killers.

" From now on, you will lay down your lives to protect America's chick flicks, buddy comedies and steady stream of animated misfires.

 Sir, you have to see this.

 "Took it off the Web "watched for free never pay for a movie again"? Men, set your guns on "kill.

" We're going after Homer Simpson.

 I now present, direct from the computer of an angry editor at a special effects house, Cosmic Wars Episode Seven.

 (epic orchestral theme playing) (audience cheering) My childhood has been un-ruined! Listen up, seat meat! You are all in violation of Title 17 of the U.

S.

 Copyright Code.

 (all gasping) Easy there, hotshot.

 All the people are doing is watching a movie.

 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! I'm not wearing an undershirt and my badge is poking into my skin.

 What's going on here? Is there a fondler in the neighborhood? I'm here to arrest and hopefully stage the prison suicide of the mastermind of this operation-- Homer Simpson! Ooh, mastermind.

 We got our man, thanks to a tip from a heroic American snitch.

 (gasps) One of you turned me in? Who was it? You! Superintendent Chalmers, you never forgave me for that time we wore the same Hawaiian shirt to that luau! They're gonna take Dad! We gotta do something! I'm on it.

 (screams) Copyrighted material! Don't look at it! Someone sell me a ticket! Ear plugs in! Blinders on! We trained for this! (gunshot) (grunting) From now on, the only place you'll be watching movies without having to buy a ticket is jail.

 Oh oh (whimpers) Baby, promise me you'll find out who turned me in.

 (moans) It's probably someone I would never suspect.

 Never suspect.

 (moans) Your moans of sympathy are all I have.

 Oh HOMER: Whoever did this to me will be haunted by unbearable guilt forever! Forever! What are you guys in for? Bank robbery.

 Drug trafficking.

 What about you? Movie piracy.

 (all gasp) What?! People in show business work hard to make those movies.

 My media stocks under-performed because of people like you.

 My brother lost his job as a grip on a movie set because of piracy.

 He had to sell his Jet Ski.

 A grip without a Jet Ski ain't no grip at all! (yelling) You're about to find out what we do to copyright infringers.

 (yelling) (tires screech) (all clamoring) (train horn blowing in distance) Uh huh? (horn blowing) Huh? (screams) (men yelling) (grunting) (screams) Whoo-hoo! It's almost like having Dad here.

 Only with less growling when I go near his food.

 I just want to know who dropped the dime on Dad.

 Lousy rat.

 Maybe the person that turned your father in thought they were doing the right thing.

 Homer just pirated a movie.

 But it's not the worst thing Dad ever did.

 It's not even the worst kind of pirate Dad's ever been.

 Lisa, tell your brother that stealing is wrong, no matter what.

 I don't know.

 It wasn't like Dad was stealing for himself.

 He created this wonderful experience for the whole town.

 I just can't imagine anyone turning him in.

 (door creaking open) Dad, Dad, you're back, you're back! Hey! Dad, you're back! Dad! Homer, what are you doing out of prison? You have to go back and give yourself up.

 I can't go back to jail! There's no shampoo, just soap! Wait, I know one place in Springfield that doesn't care about Internet piracy laws.

 Thanks for taking us in.

 Our family always appreciates asylum.

 This consulate is like being on Swedish soil.

 You're as safe here as you would be in the Skatteskrapan.

 (whistles) Your country doesn't think illegally downloading movies is wrong? The people of Sweden believe all movies should be shared freely.

 How is that not stealing? Bah, your Hollywood studios are the real thieves, claiming all their hit movies have lost money.

 I spit on their bookkeeping.

 Yeah, and why don't they make a sequel to Taken where The Hangover guys get taken and the only ones that could rescue them is Fast and Furious.

 Aw, man, I would love to pirate that.

 As would the proud people of Sweden.

 (sirens blaring) (tires screeching) They've found us! There's only one surefire way to get fugitives out of a foreign building-- blasting death metal.

  Respecting the law, respecting the law   Copyright law, copyright law   Copyright law, copyright law  You like this? Oh-oh, Swedes love death metal.

 It reminds us of death.

 Damn those Peace Prize-giving fish-smokers.

 I'm so tired of being trapped in this embassy.

 Consulate.

 Consulates are regional offices, which serve the embassy in the capitol.

 Thank you so much for sticking with me through all this.

 You're the greatest wife in the world.

 (moaning) It was me! I was the one who told the FBI.

 You? How could you? You're my own flesh and blood.

 I was just trying to do the right thing.

 Who would've thought the authorities would use a confession against me? Have you forgotten what you promised at our wedding? To love and cherish? To aid and abet? I never wanted to say funny vows.

 Well, you did! And they got laughs.

 Solid laughs! I didn't mean for this to happen, but you were stealing.

 All I ever had was you looking out for me.

 I got nothing now.

  All rise in the matter of The People vs.

 Homer Simpson.

 The people call Hollywood ultra-producer, Judd Apatow.

 Homer Simpson is an enemy of art.

 Art created by writers, directors, and the guy who uses a computer to erase or enhance nipples.

 And not just the people who dream for a living, but the people who depend on us.

 The spin class instructors, the personal rabbis, Seth Rogen.

 (laughing) (crying): It's true, I need him.

 I saw a bootleg DVD of The 40 Year Old Virgin for sale at a car wash.

 They left off my director's commentary! It didn't even have a blooper reel! (all groaning) (gavel banging) Homer Simpson, you have been found guilty of illegal reproduction and distribution of copyrighted material.

 Before sentencing, do you have anything to say for yourself? No.

 Homer, tell them your side of the story.

 I know I hurt you, but please trust me now.

 It'll work.

 You know what, Judge Apatow? I do have something to say.

 These movie people may say I'm a pirate, but I'm just a man.

 A man who loved Hollywood too much.

 So I made my own rules and fought the big guys who tried to destroy my way of life.

 He doesn't sound like a villain.

 He sounds like a classic underdog.

 He's the unlikeliest of heroes! But where's the love story? At first my wife didn't believe in me.

 Maybe we forgot why we fell in love in the first place.

 But when times seemed darkest, one minute ago, she was there and gave me the strength and courage to fight for what I believe in.

 He's a downloading David versus a greedy Goliath.

 An Erin Brockovich but with more cleavage! Two, three Good Lord, he's hitting all four quadrants! One family, against all odds, took on the system and lost.

 (clamoring) Mr.

 Simpson, I'd like to buy the rights to make a movie based on your true story.

 I'm attached as executive producer! Attached! Attached! One movie? We envision a trilogy.

 Will Smith's family wants to play your family.

 I'd be Jaden.

 (all clamoring) On behalf of Hollywood, we are dropping all charges.

 These people hate my dad.

 How can they want to make a movie about him? Hollywood may be run by big corporations trying to squash people, but they make movies about people standing up to big corporations trying to squash them and winning.

 I'll sign with whoever can convince Channing Tatum to gain the most weight to play me.

 Surprise! - Surprise! Surprise! What the hell is all this? We're so excited about your movie that we're having a special screening.

 But the movie isn't in theaters till next week.

 Yeah, we ripped a version off Bootleg Bay just like you taught us.

 It's still got timecode on it, but, otherwise, it's a clean copy.

 (chuckles) You're pirating my movie? The hell you are! Piracy is stealing! You're taking money out of my family's mouths! (gasping) But the movie is i-it's about you pirating movies.

 Oh, that's Hollywood fantasy.

 We live in the real world, where I have something called prof-it par-tic-i-pa-tion.

 That's negative, man.

 Oh, Homie Now all of you go see my movie in the theater the day it opens! No bargain matinees! And tell your friends it was great! Buy the stuff they advertise in the commercials before it! Homer in the movie wears Ask Body Spray and so should you! Don't ask! Do smell! Homie, do you really think you should be Up-bup-bup-bup-bup! What have we learned about not blindly supporting our husband? Ask Body Spray! and FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY But then when times seemed darkest, she was there; she gave me the strength and courage to fight for what I believe in.

 On behalf of Hollywood, we're dropping all charges! (cheering) (laughing) So what do you think, Lise? Who are the good guys here, the media companies or the Internet freedom guys? Well, both groups claim their intentions are noble, but at the end of the day, they're both trying to steal as much money as they can.

 So everyone's a pirate? And the worst one of all is (Seth Rogen laughing) Shh!

 Clueless fanboys in costume.

 I won't know which day to write in my diary.

 Homer.

 What? Will you take me to buy a comic book Tuesday at midnight? And miss the back half of Jimmy Kimmel? That's when he experiments, boy.

 Yes, I have.

 After the Oscars, when he forces you.

 Can I go first? I was once cast to play Fallout Boy in a movie.

 Tell it to Harlan Ellison.

 I think, you over-privileged kids with your electronic tablets and your talking phones, wouldn't know a good piece of fiction if your iPod read it to your ass.

 I wish someone would have come from the future, and warned me not to talk to you.

 That's my idea! You're stealing my idea! Sorry.

 C-B-G.

 What's the happs, my man? Well, well, well.

 If it isn't Milo, the owner of my main competitor, Coolsville.

 Or should I say, "Foolsville.

" That is some tasty cashish, my friend.

 Indeed.

 And how did you spend your evening? Um Let's see.

 I wrote a Lost fan fiction finale that also answers all the questions from Twin Peaks.

 Reranked all the DoctorWhos by puffiness of the hair.

 Oh, and I also got married to my actual, non-imaginary, comic-tolerating girlfriend, Strawberry.

 Now when Milo talks to himself, it won't seem crazy.

 So, Milo talks to himself.

 We will treasure that information.

 Yes we will.

 Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna share this primo origin ish with my bride.

 Even the mintiest comic is just acidifying pulp, if you have no one to read it with, right? Nerds don't get girls.

 These days they do, man.

 Comic-Con is now eight percent women.

 STRAWBERRY: Burn! Wrong Wrong! Wro-- Where is he? Come on, buddy, I gotta get home and climb into bed with my loving wife.

 Oh, right.

 You have a loving wife.

 Oh.

 Marge and I get along perfect.

 We're like George Burns and John Denver.

 Oh, man! Carrying these kids is hard on my back.

 Oh! Oh, yeah! And now to Moe's.

 Look at him.

 Look.

 He's got family friends.

 What do I have? Oof.

 Jimmy Olsen vs.

 Matter Eater Lad.

 Hm.

 This is better than I remembered, actually.

 No! No it isn't! It-It's horrible! (moans) The only thing that could make this moment more cliched, is if I started to sing about my feelings.

 And here I go.

 (slow, melancholy intro)  I've always been happy  To call myself single  No Mary Jane  Or Lois Lane  With whom I'd co-mingle  You could say that I was  An unstackable Pringle  I've got originals signed  By Siegel and Shuster  But they don't satisfy  In the way that they used-ter   It really don't matter if you've got a Cap Anson   If you spend your nights in your underwear prancin'   With your cardboard stand  Of Scarlett Johansson! (yelling, grunting)  Guess I've always been lonely   But I've never revealed it  Dropped my heart into Mylar  And then (sobs)  Vacuum sealed it.

 (quiet sigh) Stan Lee! Or, is it my imagination? I'm your imagination.

 The real Stan Lee's over there.

 Excelsior! But listen, as comic book guys go, you're trim, friendly, and, quite a catch.

 (laughs) But now your opportunity is knocking.

 Huh?! Don't let it slip by.

 Can you help me? I can only watch.

 I cannot interfere.

 New Radioactive Man number one, please.

 Come on, nudnik.

 Ask her out.

 You're interfering.

 Hey, I'm 90 years old.

 I can do what I want.

 Um Er Stammer.

 Eh C-Can I sign you up for our frequent buyer's club? The Just Us League? You would be member number 003.

 I-- I am the first two.

 Sure.

 I am Kumiko Nakamura from Osaka.

 I am visiting America's saddest cities, as research for my autobiographical manga.

 Volume Six, Springfield.

 Land of Angry Tears.

 That's you.

 The man with sparkling eyes, and zigzag beard.

 You have seen me before? Yes.

 Through window.

 But you don't see me.

 You're either looking down in disgust, or up in disdain.

 I think you have great soul.

 Would you permit me to go in the back, and do a brief inventory? (muffled): She tolerates me! Ah Is it too soon to give you flowers in a Hulk hand? It is the perfect time.

 (doorbell rings) (humming happily) Hmm? (yelling): Bart! Your comic vendor's here.

 Uh, actually, it is you that I am here to see.

 I, um, I need your help.

 I am getting ready for a date.

 (stammers) The closest thing I have to a father is the Obi-Wan doll in my store.

 And he comes from a race of celibate knights.

 So I will help you.

 As long as our bellies never touch again like they are right now.

 BOTH: Ew! MARGE: Oh! Why pick me? Because you are the only fat man in real life who ever got a hot woman.

 Hey.

 Ooh (laughs) Well, come in.

 I'll explain how it all works.

 Okay.

 It helps if she's got a mother she's trying to get back at.

 MARGE: Aw No woman will be able to resist you, dressed like this.

 Now, remember, don't be the way you normally are and sustain that for the rest of your life.

 Kumiko, uh, meet my dear friends uh, Homer and Marge Simpson.

 I-In my country, it is a tradition to bring a much older couple on a first date.

 It is not in any way, weird, or-or sad.

 Does anyone tell you that you look like the man on a box of Mr.

 Sparkle? Aka ni taishte burei da! Yogore o yaburu! In Japan, drinking your detergent is a popular method of suicide.

 (gasps) Honki da yo?! Kumiko, for you, we chose the coolest restaurant in town.

 But the walls are covered with garbage.

 MARGE: Oh Not garbage, Americana.

 Here's some more Americana, that bubbled up in the swamp.

 Here you go: Your All-American Fifty State Potato Skin Sampler.

 Okay: Wisconsin, cheddar.

 Maryland, blue crab.

 They're neither in alphabetical, nor geographical order.

 What-What madness is this? Please, sir.

 Ask your questions after all 50 "tates.

" I cannot hide the snide inside.

 Oh.

 I don't mind.

 If you think it's stupid, say it's stupid.

 Really? In Japan, no one ever says what they think.

 We know our game shows are degrading and our baseball fences are too close.

 But no one says anything.

 (gasps) Attention, restaurateurs! (diners murmuring) You should've spent less on the kitsch, and more on the kitch-en.

 With this bowl of Chuck's Cherokee Salsa, I baptize you mediocre, at best.

 (laughs) American nerd snark is the finest in the world.

 Let's go walking and mocking in the rain.

 I'm in love! And, yet, still a little bitter.

 It's surprising.

 (Japanese pop song "Ponponpon" playing) JIM-JAM BONKS: Father, why-sa you-sa forsake-a me-sa?  (applause) Marge, Homer, you have nurtured our love like Steven Speilberg nurtured the careers of Zemeckis and Gale.

 (sympathetically): Oh So, we want you to know, I have decided to move in to the basement under his store.

 At last, we'll be in the same bed.

 Just like Batman and Robin.

 HOMER: Ohh.

 MARGE: Hmm Homer, I want you to take Kumiko and Comic Book Guy a housewarming present, and maybe check in on them? We talked about this, Marge.

 The hammock is a chore-free zone.

 Apparently, including tying the knots on the hammock.

 And getting the termites out of the trees.

 (squeaking) Not a word.

 (Japanese accent): Excuse me, sir.

 I am looking for my daughter.

 I thought this was her residence, but all I see is a store full of, uh, non-pornographic manga.

 (gasps) You're Kumiko's father? Welcome, sensei.

 I am not a Kung fu instructor.

 I am a humble salary man who could kick your ass.

 Say, has anyone told you you look like-- I know.

 Mr.

 Sparkle.

 I was going to say, like you're going to have a stroke.

 (laughs) I get that a lot too.

 Now, please, where is my daughter? Okay.

 She moved in with her boyfriend.

 Well, he's not a boy.

 He's immature.

 But, fat and old.

 So, an obese nerd has stolen my daughter to live in his basement? I didn't tell you about the basement.

 It was an obvious guess! (bell dings) (crying) Daughter! You are coming back to Japan! There are 87 old people who need you to take care of them.

 No.

 Please Please.

 I was becoming cuddly.

 I deleted rants from my blog.

 You can retrieve rants if you did not empty your trash.

 Goodbye! Now I know I've got a heart because it's breaking.

 Wizard of Oz reference! Did I do that? Urkle reference! (panting) Help me.

 Fire reference! (panting): I can't stop.

 I can't stop.

 Homer Simpson, this was your doing.

 And I want you to fix it.

 I have a bad feeling about this! Every action movie ever made reference! Now! Yeah, Homer.

 We have much in common.

 We both love our daughters, and discipline our sons.

 No discipline would imply, I'm trying to make him better.

 So are you married? (sighs) My dear Michiko has passed away.

 But she's always with me.

 You promise double suicide.

 You hear what you want to hear.

 Always with me.

 Another drink! Something stronger! (creaks) BARTENDER (dramatically): Snake rice wine.

 Now, that's disgusting.

 Wine made of rice? Try some.

 Hai.

 (hissing) (Homer slurring drunkenly) (Mr.

 Nakamura drunkenly laughs) (slurring): Why didn't I stop with the snake wine? Why did I drink the fish wine? That was the aquarium.

 (quiet, gentle melody plays) (engine humming) (tires screeching) You didn't see nothin'.

 Scram.

  (clanking) Uh! I am ruined by whimsy.

 MILHOUSE'S VOICE: The good thing is, soon I'll be a beautiful swan.

 (cackling) Aw (whimpers) What's going on here? BART &amp; LISA: We'll explain it.

 The rice wine has penetrated to the essence of your souls.

 Yeah, listen to my tail.

 You're the tail! No You're the tail.

 (yelling): Dad! Bart's feet are on my half of the shell! (screaming): Why, you slimey little-- Ow! (both grunting) (grunting) Ooh.

 Hey, that actually feels good.

 (grunting) Oh, yeah.

 More.

 A little bit more.

 (shouting) Right there.

 Oh, yeah.

 Oh, yeah.

 That's the stuff.

 Enough nonsense! I came here for my daughter!  I-I am a golden bird  And I love the comic nerd  Of this, I won't be cured  Papa-san, Papa-san.

 The monster is me.

 Who 'da thunk it? (weeping) (thunder rumbling) (sighs) Homer, drinking that snake wine, and going to White Castle afterwards, really opened my eyes.

 Mr.

 Nakamura, I have used my hitherto unmentioned chemical engineering degree to get a real job at the Springfield Phosphate Works.

 They're giant polluters.

 But the CEO is a woman.

 It's very vexing.

 Now, have I proven myself worthy of your daughter? (firmly): No.

 Please, take your time.

 You were worthy! The way you were.

 I-- I was? But I rented the store.

 I eBayed my stool.

 Cancel the sale.

 But then my seller rating will go down Stop being nerd! Yes, Papa-san.

 Geekly beloved, we are gathered here in the eyes of me, King of the Cameos, Stan Lee.

 To celebrate the wedding of, Comic Book Guy, and Kumiko Nakamura.

 Does anyone wish to offer any thoughts, on this blessed occasion? Yes.

 (clears throat) I-I-I would like to say something.

 Um, since I met Kumiko, strangely, comic books no longer seem so important.

 I will also be selling greeting cards.

 And, every day, I will give one to Kumiko in commemoration of today, with the salutation, "Best Day Ever.

" Ghost Wife, are you happy? Kind of! (traditional Japanese music playing) MILHOUSE: How long am I gonna stay this way? As long as we keep drinkin' this.

 (clink) DOLPH: Give us your eggs.

 I'm a boy.

 KEARNEY: We said eggs.

 (all laughing) Yes! and FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY Shh!   


                





                    			 D'oh! (tires screeching) (grunts) ANNOUNCER: Welcome to Super Bowl XLVIII between the Seattle Seahawks and the Denver Broncos.

 The field is a frozen tundra, (Bart laughing) imported at great expense from Alaska.

 Hmm? Hmm?! Huh? (shrieks) (gasps) Oh! (gasps) (screams) (screams, jabbers) (screams, jabbers) Whoo-hoo.

 (whimpers) (sobs) (Homer continues whimpering, sobbing) (electricity buzzes, Homer screams and whimpers) (Homer screams, electricity crackles) ANNOUNCER: And the game comes down to this one play-- (Homer screaming) a final field goal.

 The kick is up, it hits the crossbar and-- (power humming off) HOMER: D'oh! (Homer slurps beer, then whoops) (to tune of "Silver Bells"):  Glowing rods, glowing rods  It's making me  Weak and dizzy Uh, rumor has it they're about to give out the company Christmas gifts.

 Who told you that? I got an in.

 The VP of Personnel is doing my girlfriend.

 Ooh, look at you, Mr.

 Connected.

 I hope it's better than last year's lousy gift.

 CARL: Yeah, what a rip.

 Ugh.

 Remember this gift? The executive stress ball.

 BURNS' VOICE: One more squeeze and you're fired.

 (gasps) Now I feel more stressed than ever.

 Gah! (gags) BURNS' VOICE (muffled): Excellent.

 Excellent.

 Excellent.

 Uh, you don't look so excellent to me.

 (retches) Ho, ho, humbug.

 Santa Claus approaches to judge and punish.

 Wow! A good gift for once.

 Oogle Goggles.

 Augmented reality glasses.

 You wear them like eyeglasses, but inside the lens, you see information about the people and places around you.

 Ooh, finally I'm not a slave to my stupid human eyeballs.

 (gasping in wonder) HOMER: Ooh! Whoa.

 (high-pitched gibbering) (smug chuckling) Glasses, call Lenny.

 Ooh, I'm getting a call.

 Answer call.

 Hello? Lenny, it's me, Homer.

 Hm.

 I always thought it was "Simp-sen.

" Really? Don't you ever look up at the sky? (theme song playing) Always wondered what that was.

 Sir, I'm concerned about your sudden generosity.

 The doctor said to bring you in right away if you display kindness or warmth.

 Oh, don't worry.

 This Santa still has claws.

 As of now, each of those nuclear nitwits is wearing a video camera.

 With a direct feed to me.

 (gasps) You're spying on them? Smithers, how much did this company lose to office supply theft last year? $7,043.

 Yes, well, no more of that.

 Thanks to this $26 million surveillance system.

 Beware, rabbits.

 I spy with my transplanted eyes.

 Oh, and I forgot to show you the best feature.

 Each of these buttons represents an employee.

 When I press it, he or she dies.

 (scoffs) What's wrong with this thing? (grunts in frustration) Now, remember kids, the school says you must have a valentine card for everyone in your class.

 How does this mean anything when everyone's forced to do it? What did I say about pointing out the meaninglessness of things? Not to.

 Well, no way I'm giving a valentine to Nelson.

 He's a bully, and I do not love him.

 Jesus says to love your enemies.

 That's because Jesus knows one day, he gets to look his enemies in the eye and say "It was me who sent you to Hell.

" Bart, your school requires you to give everyone a valentine card in an envelope with a fun sticker.

 Your teacher put out an e-mail alert.

 With a video attachment.

 MAN: Welcome to Firstline.

 Tonight, "Valentine's Day: Always A Massacre.

" At this school, children may give valentines to whomever they choose.

 Danny is unpopular, due to rumors he sleeps in the raw with his ma and his pa.

 Human young are born with the ability to count valentines, and Danny realizes he's been snubbed.

 Past generations of children were used to rejection.

 But today's kids, raised in a climate of video games and instant messaging, are fragile weirdos.

 LYMAN: On February 15, 2:00am, after checking the mailbox one last time, Danny nearly died from an overdose of little candy hearts.

 Many of history's monsters never received a valentine.

 Attila the Hun,Mao Tse-tung, and me, Will Lyman.

 This is Firstline.

 Fine, Nelson gets a valentine.

 An old one from the box.

 Perfect.

 Bad movie, bad pun, even bad paper stock.

 (Homer laughing) (giggles) What's so funny? I'm watching videos of idiots wearing these glasses and not paying attention to the world around them.

 Look at these jerks.

 (man screams) Ow! (man screams) I don't understand what's so great about these state of the art, solar-powered, computo-glasses.

 I'll let you try them on, right after I decide if these videos are Funny Or Die.

 Funny, funny, die, die, funny, funny but the guy died.

 Oh.

 Now, a simple Sunday drive will reveal the hidden wonders of our hometown.

 Hmm (grunting with effort) Whoo-hoo! D'oh! Springfield City Hall was built for the Spencer Tracy movie Meet Me At City Hall.

 It was just a flat wall with nothing behind it for 30 years.

 Dad, Bart's on my side of the seat.

 Dad, Lisa's my little sister.

 (both grunting) The rearview mirror was invented in 1911, for just this reason.

 Interesting.

 When was the term "shut up" invented? As early as 1859, shut up was used to shut up Homie, I think the kids are just hungry.

 Glasses, direct me to the nicest restaurant I can afford.

 FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE: Accessing soup kitchens.

 What, you Oh, that's it, I'm taking you off.

 Aah! Reality.

 JEREMY: Oh! Sorry, sir! Okay, let's see what we got here.

 Ugh, oh! Ooh.

 Eh.

 MARGE: Oh.

 (Homer giggles) HOMER: Mm-hmm.

 Squeeze here.

 Rotate there.

 Pause for sweet talk.

 Oh, glasses, you're so wonderful.

 Huh? A-Are you using your glasses for snuggling? But the avatar looks just like you.

 I'm afraid wives don't make passes at husbands in those glasses.

 Glasses, find me a great gift for my wife.

 (whispers): Under five dollars.

 MARGE: I heard that! Glasses, take me two minutes back in time.

 Oh (grumbles) Marge.

 Mm.

 About the glasses.

 Mm! I'm really sorry, and Mm, mm, mm.

 Here's your breakfast.

 Only five pancakes? You're trying to kill me.

 Well, I'm not happy with you.

 Look, honey, I know these glasses are a radical new technology and should be worn in moderation.

 Isn't that right, glasses? FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE: Yes, just like I told you.

 Anyway, I'm giving them up.

 To whoever dares take them.

 (Lisa and Bart gasp) Yoink.

 Aw, come on, Mom.

 For once, I'm grabbing the goody.

 So the rumors are true.

 Moms can want things.

 Hmm.

 Hmm Nicely done, Lewis.

 A Transformer that transforms into a heart? I love it! Mm.

 This Hershey's Kiss is melted.

 Not good.

 My mom left it on the dashboard! My mom! I'll have yours now, Simpson.

 In Ga'hoole, we would break his frickin' knees.

 No.

 No Valentine for you, Nelson.

 Excuse me? I'll give a Valentine to a loser, I'll give a Valentine to a dork, I'll even give a Valentine to a girl, but I won't give a Valentine to a bully! Here's what's gonna happen.

 You have one week to make me the best Valentine any kid ever got.

 And what if I don't? Simpson, there's gonna be a heart in my hand, either paper or yours.

 Hey, everybody.

 That's strange.

 I-I'm hearing a voice, but I'm not seeing a user icon.

 Carl, it's me.

 I'm here.

 Really here! Hey, Homer.

 A lot of information about you.

 Let me just page through it.

 Oh! Stop! Hey! What? Oh, no one can live in a non-augmented reality.

 I need another pair of glasses.

 Charlie, your move in Muppet Chess.

 Gonzo to Fozzie Seven.

 Aw! That's Kermit-mate.

 Wocka wocka! Oh, why is it the recipe card you need is always the one Homer writes his cocktail ideas on? Maybe these bleep-bloop glasses can help.

 Okay, Marge Simpson entering the Matrix, for a brownie recipe.

 FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE: Here are my top-rated recipes.

 Ooh.

 So many choices, Maggie.

 (beeping) HOMER: Um, Mr.

 Burns, sir? Can I get another pair of glasses? Maybe two pair? One for the beach house? Can I also get a beach house? Two beach houses.

 Huh? Monitors?! What the? Burns gave us those glasses so he could spy on us! This is a violation of our human rights.

 (cracks knuckles) Okay, so let's see what we can see.

 Solitaire, top hats on eBay, Angry Birds fan fiction, guy doing really easy crossword puzzle, Lenny doing Carl's clown makeup someone's actually working? Maggie?! Who's Mommy's little girl? Genealogy.

org says you are! You are! (Maggie giggles) (chuckles): Aw Wait a minute.

 Since Marge is wearing my glasses, I can see everything she sees! Uh-uh, I shouldn't watch this.

 MARGE: Such a good baby.

 You deserve some ice cream.

 Wait a minute-- Marge said we were out of ice cream.

 (Marge humming happily) Ooh! (Marge chuckles) (gasps) Oh! What else is Marge hiding from me? (doorbell rings) MARGE: Maggie, he's here! Oh, is she having an affair? Thanks for asking me to lunch.

 Oh, why isn't she having an affair?! What about a Valentine that says: "Bully, for you"? Hmm, interesting.

 "Interesting" means "no.

" "Interesting" means "no.

" (snaps fingers) Milhouse, you're a genius! I am? What did I say? (groans): Oh, nothing.

 On TV when a guy says something lame, another guy says he's a genius, and then he has an idea.

 I thought it might work for me.

 Well, you called me a genius.

 That means a lot.

 Oh, I hate this stupid holiday! The only thing you can do is screw it up.

 (gasps) That's it! Bart, you're a genius! Well, if you keep throwing the word around, it means nothing.

 Who are you? Mr.

 Burns! Oh.

 I'm so sorry, Mr.

 Burns.

 I won't bother you again.

 HOMER: Marge, that's a "Compact Only" space.

 (Marge grunts) (chuckles): Well who knew you were such a rebel? Now let's learn more about my wife's secret life.

 Secrets which can only be good.

 Hi, Marge.

 Dr.

 Carlock is ready for you.

 MARGE: Thank you.

 So, Marge, how have you been? MARGE (sighs): Okay, I guess.

 Marge is in therapy?! MARGE: Oh, I hate when I come here and the first word out of my mouth is "Homer.

" But here we go, again.

 (sighs) Homer was converting our dollars to "yu-ros.

" Not the money, the sandwich.

 And has there been any improvement in Homer's drinking? MARGE: Well, he's down to two beers in the shower.

 They're pale ales! Please! Well, maybe if you just concentrate on one problem, like his temper.

 MARGE: Oh, everything in the newspaper makes him mad.

 Not Marmaduke! Never Marmaduke! Marmaduke was horrible today! Also, Marge is in therapy, and she didn't even tell me.

 Whoa.

 She has crossed a line.

 How did you find out? Spied on her with a hidden camera.

 She thinks I'm selfish.

 She thinks I don't spend enough time with the kids.

 Well, that's crazy.

 Come on.

 You work your butt off in a radioactive hellhole, and what do you get? Not one lousy superpower.

 I guess the only choice is to come clean with her and tell her what I know, and how I know.

 Whoa, whoa! Bad idea.

 No, no.

 Chicks do not like finding out they're being spied on.

 I speak from loooooong.

 experience.

 No, you got to make it seem like you found out by accident there.

 Um ooh! Next week you schedule an appointment with the therapist after hers, and then you bump into Midge in the waiting room there.

 Moe, that's great! (chuckles): How do you get your ideas? Pretty much all my friends are divorced guys.

 Hello, Homie! Dinner's almost ready.

 Pork chops with my secret seasoning.

 Yeah, you do like your secrets, don't you, Marge? Don't lose your cool, Homer.

 The building block of a marriage is long silence.

 Hey, where'd she go? Good, good, you held your tongue there.

 Because-- hey, where'd you go? Doesn't anybody want me to give 'em advice? Okay there, Fido, when you see that squirrel outside, at first you play it cool, you understand? (barks twice) "I fear you"? This is what Valentine's Day means to you?! This is what it means to everyone.

 How can you be forced to say "I love you"? People only give Valentines because they're scared of what would happen if they didn't.

 "Nelson, you frighten me so, "The psycho-est bully I know, "You're a sociopath in need of a bath, I'm sure you'll wind up on death row.

" (sniffing) Mmm! You can really smell the fear on this.

 I rubbed it on Milhouse.

 Simpson, you just touched my heart's butt.

 Why are you hugging yourself? Why are you hugging yourself?! If Nelson doesn't do something bully-ish in two seconds, I'm gonna wedgie him.

 Nelson doesn't wear underwear.

 Wow.

 Always one step ahead.

 Uh, I'm here to check in for the 3:00.

 Please fill out these forms, Mr.

 Fakinami.

 No, it's "Fake Name.

" I'll just call you Elias.

 That's "Alias.

" Duh.

 Hm! HOMER: Finally.

 Time for the big bump-into.

 Same time next week, Marge? Oh, absolutely.

 These sessions keep me on an even keel.

 Dr.

 Carlock is like my Wednesday reset button.

 HOMER: Wednesday? (pleasant classical music playing)  Okay, she's always in a good mood after therapy.

 (sad, minor-key music playing)  (Marge hums happily) Oh, my God.

 Marge needs this.

 It lights her way through the dark path of marriage to me.

 Come on in, Mr.

 Fakinami.

 No need.

 Everything's fine.

 I'm sorry, but there are no cancellations within 24 hours.

 (chuckles): Well, as long as I'm paying for the time Ow! Where'd you learn to cut hair? (nervous chuckle) You know, you have some anger issues.

 More snip, less lip.

 Oh, I forgot to tell you, Homie, I bumped into Helen Lovejoy today, and guess what? I don't need to know, Marge.

 You deserve to have your secrets.

 It's not a secret.

 It's a funny story.

 Okay, Marge, but first, well I have something I need to tell you.

 Something I did you might be mad about, and rightly so.

 Oh, I bet my story's more interesting.

 Whoo-hoo! I tried! Okay.

 Okay, so, Helen Lovejoy told me that she made her famous snickerdoodle Bundt cake for the church sale, and she put in salt instead of sugar! (laughs) Yeah? And? That's it.

 That was the story.

 Where's that cake now? It got sold.

 Who bought it? Dr.

 Hibbert.

 Excuse me.

 I have to make a call.

 Don't take too long.

 Okay, Hibbert's in surgery, but they're having him paged.

 (both moaning passionately) Wait, something's wrong.

 (grunts) That's better.

 Oh, dear God.

 Hi, Ralph.

 Um, I just wanted to tell you, there was a tooth in the Valentine you gave me.

 Plant it and you'll grow a new Ralph.

 I don't need a new Ralph.

 I like the old one.

 Happy Valentine's Day.

 Well, better get ready for St.

 Patrick's! and FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY Shh!   


                





                    			 (squeals) (exclaiming) (school bell ringing) (Barney belches) (whistle blows) (yells) (beeping) (playing the blues) (playing the blues) D'oh! (tires screeching) (grunts) (electrical buzzing) (Homer grunts) MARGE: D'oh! Stupid fuse.

 Mmm! Maggie? Maggie! Maggie? Maggie! Mmm! (honking) Mmm! (groans, growls) (grunts) (honking) (growling) Hmm Maggie? Maggie! Hmm.

 Hey! Maggie! And it's for all these reasons and more that the Kingdom of Moab is the least interesting in the Bible.

 Amen.

 Amen! We're done! Allow me to introduce our guest speaker (Homer groans) from the ill-advised mission in Indonesia, the Reverend Kartawijaya.

 (Bart groans) I know how you feel, young man.

 Huh? The children in my village are just like you.

 One boy, named Sumadi, never comes to church.

 He is always tying the monkeys' tails together and yelling, "Tiger is gone," when, in fact, tiger is there.

 Hmm! Unfortunately, Sumadi is sick now.

 What?! Su-Sumadi has a problem? Sumadi and others equally doe-eyed need urgent medical treatment.

 After all, we are all just children of Allah.

 I mean God.

 Sorry.

 Recent convert.

 Poor Sumadi.

 Born in such a terrible country.

 Now, wait a minute.

 But good news.

 To help him, we will now have a second collection.

 (congregation groans) Wasn't our sympathetic nodding enough? Mom, can I have some money? I'm sorry, honey.

 I'm all out.

 I spent all I had lighting that candle for Great Aunt Betty.

 I hope that wasn't somebody's Aunt Betty or something.

 Dad, please? For Sumadi? Sorry, son, I only have 20s.

 And if God needs money, why doesn't he just write another Bible? The first one sold pretty well.

 Does anyone remember when it was considered rude to talk in church? Pipe down, Ned.

 Please? All right, son, but you have to pay me back.

 (sighs) Life is good.

 Do you have my money? What? Do you have my money? How could I? Right, right, too soon.

 Do you have my money? (groans) Seriously, do you have my money? Where's my money? Huh? (slurping) Where's my money? Where's my mon ey? It's been a rough patch, man.

 Hope you got something to cheer me up.

 Well, there is one fun fact I've been saving for an emergency situation.

 Did you know there really was a Duncan Hines? Where's my money? Do you have my money? Where is it? You know, if you had the money, I'm right here.

 Do you have the money? Money-money-money-money-mon Homer, quit badgering the boy.

 Pressure's how you make your beloved diamonds, Marge.

 I don't have any diamonds.

 Quit pressuring me! Money, money.

 I need money! Would you eat anything for money? I guess.

 Who are you? School play.

 Damn Yankees.

 Children of the playground! I will eat anything for money! Except money! I'll give you a quarter if you eat my gum.

 I'll give you another if you eat mine.

 Here's some orthodontic wax! (lisps): And some cinnamon! Saint-John's-wort! And here's something that'll make you forget about the other stuff.

 BART: Ay caramba.

 (blubbers) So, what else you got? All right, Simpson.

 messed-up enough to eat this.

 (laughs) (whimpers) (gasps) No, Bart, no! Do it, and you'll always be known as the kid who ate the dead frog.

 (Homer's voice): Where's my money? Get my money! Money-money-money-money-money! (disgusted exclaiming) (slurps, kids exclaim) Easiest money I ever (beeping) Son, by rights, I should be playing banjo at your funeral.

 That frog was filled to the gills with formaldehyde, a highly toxic poison.

 (chuckles) Here's your money, Dad.

 What? Did you owe me some money? And, Homer, here's your bill for $4,000.

 D'oh! Where's my money? You got my money? Where's my money? (chuckles) Seriously, where's my money? Ew! It's the kid who ate the dead frog! Herbivore! That's someone who eats plants.

 I named the frog Herb.

 Even you won't sit with me? Bart, if you sit here, I'll be the boy who sat next to the boy who ate the frog.

 And I'm already the boy who shared a comb with a boy who threw up on the boy who wet his pants at the winter carnival.

 P.

S.

 I would've given you the money.

 (groans) (tires screech) (school bell rings) (tires squeal) What's the matter, frog in your throat? You're the ones that paid me to eat it.

 All we hear is: ribbit, ribbit! (bird shrieks) (exclaiming) You said this was a simple bullying job! Diggs and Freedom at your service.

 Diggs is short for Digby.

 Thanks.

 I'm the kid that ate the frog.

 Oh, so you're the reason I had to dissect a Muppet in biology today.

 Thanks for the help, man.

 Oh, you're welcome.

 At least for me.

 There's no way to say what the bird thinks.

 Or even if he thinks, really.

 Wait, wait, wait! Who the hell are you? I transferred here a few months ago.

 To this school? On purpose? Even after Springfield Montessori opened across the street? (gentle classical music plays) That place is really in your face.

 I like the lack of attention.

 (quietly): Especially in here.

 (door creaks softly) This school has a falconry club? No way.

 I resuscitated it.

 I'm president, secretary treasurer and faculty advisor.

 That took a lot of fancy paperwork.

 But it was worth it to be left alone.

 Can I join? Hmm.

 I'll have to check with Freedom.

 (loud clink) Habemus Papam! We have a poop! It's white.

 You're in.

 Looks like the falconry club's back from the dead.

 Can the Esperanto Society be far behind? (chuckles): I mean Cu la Esperanto-Societo esti multe malantau? (sighs) Two languages, and somehow no one will talk to you.

 Gi estas vera.

 Mi tre soleca.

 Loser.

 The first thing to learn about falcons is how beautiful they are in flight.

 (screeches)   Don't fret.

 He'll be back.

 There's my Sky Gramma! (mumbles) Bart's usually first in line for Taco Night, but now he's muy tarde.

 (quiet gasp) Oh, is it all right to say "tarde"? Mmm, hey, you've said it twice, Marge-- you're in pretty deep.

 Homer! Ten-minutes rules! Lisa! (muffled): What? A rule's a rule.

 There he is! (gasps) Ah, he is just riding that thermal! You were right about watching him fly.

 I thought you'd get it.

 Seat backs and tray tables, Bart.

 We're coming in for a landing.

 (screeches) Wow, you don't know how impressive that is to a boy whose dad can't even get the dog to sit.

 Sit.

 Sit.

 Sit Sit! (yells): Sit! I don't know what that is, but it's not sitting! Where could Bart be? I saw him heading across the field after school with a kid a little bit older and undoubtedly wiser.

 Oh, I know what that means! There comes a time when a boy sneaks his first beer.

 Finally! I was beginning to think that kid was a (quietly): teetotaler.

 Bart Simpson, at your service.

 More like "at your six-pack," am I right? (laughs) It's okay if you need to take a little nap.

 Why would I want a nap? Because you're so drunk you can barely keep it together.

 I wasn't drinking.

 I was learning that nature isn't a complete waste of space.

 That doesn't sound like you.

 But it does sound like the kind of lie you'd make up after the first time you got blitzed.

 I met this kid.

 A little older, kind of strange.

 I don't think other people get him.

 But I just want to hang out with him all the time.

 (gasps) It's even better than I thought.

 You've found your Moe Szyslak! In just a few short years, you'll be getting your version of baked on your version of pot listening to your version of Journey.

 (laughs) Wha? What's he doing? (Freedom cries) Now, when he lands, you'll feed him so he has positive associations with you.

 (squawks) Don't worry, he's only bitten off one of my fingers.

 (gasps) (laughs) Just goofing on you.

 This is the finger he bit off.

 If he starts to carry you off, slip out of the glove.

 Now tell him to fly.

 Fly! Fly! Come on, man! Do the wing thing! (Freedom squawking) I did it! He did it! We did it! Yes, Bart, that is how you conjugate the verb "to do.

" Well done.

  Come Saturday morning  D'oh!  I'm going away with my friend   We'll Saturday spend   Till the end of the day  Hey! Bring back my bling.

  Just I and my friend   We'll travel for miles   In our Saturday smiles  Give that back! All I got is a hole in my face! (nasally): Uncle Krusty's back.

 (Freedom cries) Whoa! Did you teach him to do that? (laughs) Nobody could communicate that.

 Except maybe Gerard Manley Hopkins.

 "I caught this morning morning's minion "Kingdom of daylight's dauphin, "Dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding "Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding High there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing.

" Wow! (frog croaks) I've already eaten.

 Hey, you want to see something really cool? Is a falcon's training leash called a creance? Yes! (grunts) Say something so I'll know you're not hurt.

 I'm really hurt.

 Phew! Bartholomew! Good to see you, old sport.

 Where's Freedom? Well, my dad said don't bring home any more dogs, cats, turtles or snakes, but he never said anything about predatory birds.

 (muffled squawk) (fans cheering) Okay, in your terms, points are like mice (screeches) Don't interrupt.

 I just thought it would be nice if we shared an interest.

 (Freedom screeches) Ooh GRAMPA: You Korean girls know what a soldier likes.

 (squawks) Fine! But the game is much more enjoyable if you understand it.

 Look, the Eagles and the Falcons.

 Tell me you're not interested in that.

 (Freedom screeches) (groans) I could fly, too, if I didn't have a wife and three kids! Hey, you've had a lot of visitors.

 No, I signed them myself.

 They're people I would've liked to come visit.

 BART: Ay, caramba! Listen, what happened in that tree? Um, you want the truth? Of course you do.

 You're like Diogenes.

 But with slingshot in place of lamp.

 I wanted to fly.

 I know it sounds a little crazy now, but I suddenly thought maybe we can all fly, but somehow we've forgotten that we can.

 You don't still think that, do you? Hey, I'm not flying anywhere with this broken wing.

 Bart, here's another doctor that would like a few words with this young man.

 This hospital has another doctor? So they're transferring him to another hospital.

 Well, I hope he gets out soon and takes his bird back.

 I don't care for how it circles the cat.

 (cat meowing) He's just riding the thermals from Dad's butt.

 At least someone in this family is using them.

 I never heard of this new hospital, so I looked it up and printed it out.

 Ooh! Can I visit him tomorrow? (sighs) I don't know, Bart.

 This is one of those Arkham Asylum-type hospitals.

 Diggs isn't cuckoo! Uh, listen, boy.

 Maybe you should spend more time with your old best friend.

 You know, Dweebler.

 Milhouse abandoned me.

 So, why can't I go there? Bart, if this is what I think it is, it's not a place we should ever, ever take a little boy.

 Then why is Diggs there? Because it's his home forever.

 You know, Bart, just because Diggs is a little different doesn't mean he's not a good person.

 What would you know about friends like Diggs? I have about eight of them.

 So, how do we fix him? Oh, Bart.

 Diggs's problems don't have easy fixes.

 What kind of cheer-up talk is this? Well, sometimes it helps to know people feel for you.

 (chuckles) Want a hug? You hug the bedpost.

 Then I hug the bedpost.

 That way we never hug each other.

  Come Saturday morning   I'm going away  Hey, Simpson.

 I heard bird boy got a new cage.

 One with rubber bars.

 Yeah, and a rubber perch! Yeah, yeah, and a I get it.

 It sucks.

 Really sucks.

 Rubber birdfeeder.

 Making fun of the mentally ill-- real classy.

 But you guys were We were what, Captain Sensitive? The rumors of my bonkertude have been greatly exaggerated.

 DSM-5 indicates paranoid schizophrenia, but that work is mired in controversy.

 Mired.

 I knew you'd escape! Were you carried out by a flock of falcons? I got a one-day pass.

 Were falcons involved in any way? I obtained the pass to enter the Springfield Falconry Contest, which is what Freedom and I were training for when we first met you.

 Oh, great.

 Before anything else, let me just get closer to the door and say, "How crazy are you?" I'm fine.

 My meds won't wear off till tonight.

 Then I'll have Freedom tear you to shreds.

 No offense, but when a crazy guy pretends to be crazy, it's not funny.

 You're discounting all talk radio.

 Excellent.

 COMIC BOOK GUY: Fly, my pet, fly! Yes! (falcon cries) Yes, now back to Papa.

 Yes.

 Why am I not surprised the only sport you do is one where a bird brings you food? Um, a falcon's greatest joy is to serve its master.

 (squawks) Fatso! Once again, I must point out that you are not a parrot.

 Fatso, fatso! Pees in the shower! (squawks) Shut up.

 What are you doing? We're up next.

 When Freedom hits the air, you and I open all the cages.

 Um with our minds? No.

 With this rope.

 I'm a messed-up kid.

 I'm not Magneto.

 ANNOUNCER: Diggs and Freedom.

 (all squawking) "In his ecstasy.

 Then off, off forth on swing!" Where's my bird going? Wherever he wants.

 He's free now.

 If you see the stork what brings us babies, kill it! Now, Bart, I'm afraid one-day passes don't last forever.

 And I'm probably not going to get another one for quite a while.

 Wait! Wh-When will I see you? You can't quit the falconry club! It's all yours, Mr.

 President.

 Well, I guess some delicate birds are safer in a cage.

 I had thought of it as a therapeutic milieu, but now "cage" is stuck in my head, so thanks.

 And thanks for being my friend.

 Bart, when I pushed you away, I was really pushing away the thought of losing you.

 How long did it take you to think that up? Two hours with the therapist.

 I'll take that.

 She came in on a Saturday.

 Missed her kid's karate demonstration.

 He was going up a belt.

 Enough! Mom, you didn't cook the falcon? Of course not.

 It's just duck.

 Aw.

 Aw.

 (munching loudly) Pass the peas, please.

 We do have them! They're my home screen! Miss Hoover, once again, the lesson plan I prepared would have covered this topic much better.

 But I can see (rumbling) (whimpers) Miss Hoover? It's Tuesday, Lisa.

 Taco Tuesday.

 (rumbling continues) (shudders) Huh? Huh? (bell rings) ALL: Taco Tuesday! Taco Tuesday! Taco Tuesday! (quietly chanting): Taco Tuesday, Taco Tuesday (rumbling) Oh, no.

 I'm about to become another moppin' statistic.

 There's only room for one of us, Ethel.

 (music from Titanic playing) (kids laughing) (grunting, yelling) (grunting) (crunching) Bart, that's your sixth taco.

 You know, Whitman says, "If anything is sacred, the human body is sacred.

" (mouth full): Fascinating.

 Congratulations, boys.

 You made it through another Taco Tuesday.

 Back in the bucket till next week.

 Won't those vegetables go bad? Nope.

 They're genetically modified to stay fresh.

 Just don't ask how old the Jell-O is.

 LISA: Ew.

 Overreactor.

org warns that over half of the vegetables sold in this country are genetically modified organisms whose effect on humans is unknown.

 Whoa! Mom, you made me overswipe! Your parents' credit card has been charged $20.

 (laughs) (gasps) I have to get to the church.

 Helen Lovejoy is posting the spring volunteer sign-up sheet.

 In five minutes, every good task will be taken.

 (tires screech) Dang it! Jasper Beardley! You'll never make it! (low mumbling) (Marge murmuring, smacking lips) No!

 Candle snuffing-- taken.

 Baby shusher, miscellaneous choir support.

 Everything's taken! All that's left is Teen abstinence counseling.

 You get to pass out abstinence pledges and make sure the kids sign their John Han-bleeps.

 (Marge grumbles) But, Ned, saying nay is your thing.

 Not this month.

 (chuckles) Edna signed us up for a tango class.

 It was the only way I could avert (sighs) wine-tasting.

 Look, I'm really not comfortable talking about S-E-X with K-I-D-S.

 Language.

 Oh, it's not that hard.

 Just tell them that God wants them to ignore everything in their bodies that God is making happen.

 We took the pledge! We won't have sex until we're married! To each other! (both humming a tune) Mm, their skipping lessons are really paying off.

 MARGE: Hello.

 Hello.

 (nervous laugh) I'm-I'm Marge Simpson, and I'm here to talk about a a-a wonderful, beautiful thing.

 Speaking of beautiful things, tongue me, babe.

 (both grunting) (gasps) How many of you are here for the free cookies? Because we've discontinued that.

 (angry chatter) I'm out of here.

 Forget you! One of our brightest and most meddlesome students called this meeting-- somehow-- to discuss an urgent menu matter.

 Lisa? Our school cafeteria is serving GMOs-- genetically modified organisms.

 (people gasping) Now, in order to thoroughly explore the issue, I'd like to play the first video that came up in my Web browser when I typed in "GMO" plus "danger" plus "question mark.

" Hear, hear!  MALE NARRATOR: If there's one thing scientists love, it's money.

 Money, money, money.

 And that's been true of scientists ever since caveman times.

 We need look no further back than the ancient Mayans, who crossbred plants and animals in an unholy experiment in what is now a resort that charges $30 a night to valet park.

 Once you're there, they've gotcha.

 (all gasp) The Mayans didn't listen to themselves.

 Yet today, we toy with our fate by using retroviruses to create these so-called "super foods.

" Are we doomed to repeat an event (snaps fingers) that destroyed all human life? The answer is in your mouth! (narrator laughing maniacally) Um, that video seemed a little unscientific.

 My name is Jenny McCarthy, and I endorse this tirade.

 Oh, my God, it's worse than I thought.

 Everybody wait here while I do some actual research.

 Nobody form any opinions while I'm gone.

 Well, hurry, we have no minds of our own.

  I say we do not categorically ban genetically modified organisms.

 ALL (gasping): What?! Well, GMOs are resistant to pests, disease and drought.

 It's just possible that GMOs can actually end world hunger.

 I say, let's get these GMOs inside our children pronto! Way ahead of you! (people whooping, shouting) I'm eating the food of the future.

 (robotically): Beep, boop.

 What is love? Boop, beep, boop.

 Lisa, I'd like to thank you for mollifying these land apes.

 We'd like you and your family to visit us at the Monsarno research campus.

 Ooh, campus! Do you have a statue of the founder I can stick a funny hat on? Go, go, go! (giggling) WOMAN: Simpsons, we're trying to change the world one molecule at a time.

 Sounds like that would take a while.

 Ooh, you're right.

 Everyone, three molecules at a time.

 (others grumbling) Oh, you got to be kidding me! (exasperated sigh) I'll be home late, honey.

 Yeah.

 Three molecules now.

 Well, it's nice to see for once a corporation that does good work and cares about people.

 Yes, Lisa, we finally put to bed the silly notion that our company is in any way evil.

 Now, say hello to our chief scientist.

 (door creaks) (all scream) SIMPSONS: Sideshow Bob! Dr.

 Sideshow Bob.

 Real doctor or PhD? PhD.

 All right, I'll leave you and Bob in this locked room to get reacquainted.

 (bolt clacks) Simpsons, there's no need for alarm.

 That's not for you to suck! Now where was I? Right.

 Uh, no need to worry.

 I'm still technically shawshanking it at Springfield Penitentiary.

 This is getting boring.

 Either murder us or tell us how you got here.

 Very well.

 The inanity of the vanity license plate puns was slowly driving me mad.

 So when Monsarno Labs asked for experimental subjects, I gladly volunteered.

 My job was to make sure the experiments wouldn't be too painful for the test monkeys.

 (zapping) (screaming) (flame whooshes) I don't know what we're doing here.

 Uh, we'll pick it up after lunch.

 (quiet chattering) (zapping) (Sideshow Bob screaming) I wrote up my results and went from subject to scientist.

 BART (laughs): Look at me! I'm Sideshow Bob! (shrieks) Sideshow Bob! Foolish boy! That's phosphoric acid! A mere sip would have dissolved a hole in your stomach the size of a silver dollar.

 Yakety, yakety, yak.

 "The spotted hawk accuses me, he complains of my gab.

" "I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable.

" Walt Whitman.

 Leaves of Grass.

 Very good.

 Lisa, you always were the one rose petal floating atop the cesspool that is the Simpsons.

 HOMER: Well! BART: That's mean.

 (clack, creaking) (giggles): Oh If you're done, our chief scientist has to get back to work.

 Our corn on the cob has become self-aware.

 Wait! Wait! Won't you visit me again? Let me show you I really am trying to make a better world.

 Lisa, we can talk Walt Whitman.

 And, Homer, I think you'd enjoy the company of the campus' lazy, overfed squirrels.

 "Overfed"? I don't know this word.

  (crickets chirping) (Marge chomping, grunting) Visit me, Lisa.

 We can discuss poetry, fine art, and and if we must, jazz.

 Mom, can I visit Sideshow Bob? Why would you want to do that? He's tried to kill us! You.

 He tried to kill you.

 And I refuse to concede a mind that thinks so much like mine can be all bad.

 Don't you think the parts that aren't evil are a little, mm pretentious? Absolutely.

 We're talking about Lisa, right? Shut up! You shut up! This is the pinnacle of conversation around here! Fine, I'll take you.

 They have this cool psych class at the campus I sat in on.

 (whispers): Uh, that was a sexual harassment seminar.

 It doesn't matter-- I'm taking it pass-fail.

 Blowing off steam in the crafts room, Marge? No! I'm not giving up on reaching those kids, and I might just have a secret weapon.

 Mm-hmm.

 Is it finger puppets? MARGE: Maybe! Well, we haven't had finger puppets in this church since Reverend Brogan was arrested.

 But I suppose enough time has passed.

 And that's why Nancy No is the most popular girl in Promiseville High.

 Mm.

 I prefer the modern thinking of Yolanda Yes.

 And I think I'd have a shot with Mabel Maybe.

 (laughter) I'm so tired of those kids sniggering.

 MARGE: Uh-oh.

 It's Horndog Hank.

 Well, Nancy knows how to keep him away.

 (material creaking) Darn it, they're stuck.

 (Marge groans) (Marge sighs) Um, can I take one of those girl puppets home? I won't do nothin' to it.

 MARGE: Oh!  You say modified tomato  I say modified tomahto  I say engineered potato, you say engineered potahto   Potato!  Potahto!  Tomato!  Tomahto! BOTH:  Let's splice some DNA! (laughs) (chuckles) That is my first non-evil laugh in years.

 Bob, there's one thing I got to know.

 Are you plotting revenge? I don't plot revenge anymore.

 It's like love.

 If it happens, it happens.

 Now, how about those s'mores? (creak, whoosh) Dad! You already ate all the chocolate bars.

 That's why I got to get the marshmallows down fast.

 (crickets chirping) I like how they cut them down from 140 characters to a more manageable Oh, another seminar tomorrow.

 I just wish I could connect with those teenagers, since it seems like we'll never have any.

 (chuckling): Oh, Marge, teens can't control their urges.

 It's why there's never been a teenage president.

 Are you saying I'm wasting my time? No.

 I'm saying you're wasting everyone's time.

 But it's a church thing, so that's a given.

 Oh.

 Well, then maybe I need to give those kids a better example.

 Good night! MARGE: Shut your eyes.

 They're too bright.

 HOMER: Sorry.

 (birds singing) Kids, today, we have a very special guest-- my husband.

 I brought Homer here to show that we can, and have, abstained for two whole days.

 Two days? That's all? That means, three days ago, the two of you made the blob with two backs! Listen, you punks, if you can't handle the image of our naked bodies in the tender act of a-oo-ga, you should never have come to the basement of this holy place.

 Ugh! He's touching her! They're practically doin' it here! Ugh! (sexy purring) (both moaning) I'll sign the pledge! Just get your fat heaving buttocks out of my head! Never! (tires squeak) All right, Bob, you've created 5,000 patents, so one hour of freedom.

 But remember, your every move will be watched by these unarmed docents.

 That block's gonna need its own ticket.

 I have a family membership.

 Well, if that's your kid, kiss it.

 (groans) Mmm.

 (makes loud kissing sound) (wheels squeaking) What next? Proto-Cubists? (with French accent): The Pointillists? Or the alleged art of Itchy and Scratchy? Ooh, ooh, I like the Impressionists.

 The boy bands of the art world.

 But for you, Lisa, I shall face the Renoir with sangfroid.

 Warmer.

 Calder.

 Warmer.

 Warmer.

 Calder.

 Calder.

 Calder! That's using your $300,000 M.

F.

A.

 To the Calder mobile! Ugh! Bob, you saved me! But how did you get the strength? Calder's work in this period was marked by heavy use of sheet metal painted to look deceptively airy.

 Well put.

 Thank you.

 (laughs) Answer the question.

 Well there is something I should have told you.

 You see, it occurred to me that if I can genetically modify fruits and vegetables, why can't I modify me?! You've been changing your DNA?! Well, at first, just a peptide here and there.

 Carrot for my presbyopia, Brahma bull for strength, and a touch of corn for highlights on my hair.

 So how strong are you? (wind whipping) Figurines.

 Get your porcelain figurines.

 Now, how about those Impressionists? I but we sang Gershwin together! Well, rhapsody in boo-hoo.

 Do you know why we came to the museum today? Well, I thought it was because it was Tote Bag Day.

 Well, that was part of it, but the biggest part was that! Washington's backbone, Einstein's eyebrows.

 Florence Nightingale's tenacity, though I'll have to clip around her moral fiber.

 (gasps) You're going to take DNA from these historical figures and add it to your own! I shall be the wisest and strongest maniac ever to bring the blessings of dictatorship to the world! BART: Jig's up, Bob! Return the spear to the Homo erectus.

 (laughing): Homo erectus? Where has that word been all my life? Now, Bart, I promised I wouldn't hurt you.

 You did that for me? More for Mom, but yes.

 But beware, I have DNA in me from Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, better known as zombie ant fungus! And we're scared of that because? What I am saying is, I could be tipped into a murderous rage by the slightest provocation.

 Could you take a picture of me with my family? Mm-hmm.

 Oh, would you take another for safety? Oh, I think my eyes were shut in that one.

 (groaning) Now, can you take one with my husband's camera? They're all ugly because you're in them! Oh.

 (children cry) Taste Praxiteles of Athens! (yelling) (moos) (panting) (phone rings) Uh, Chief, we got a report of a disturbance at the Met.

 We got bigger problems, Lou.

 Horny teens who should be out having bad sex, but instead somebody made them take an abstinence pledge, by the looks of it.

 I don't get it.

 There are taboos about premarital sex in the Middle East, and you don't see those people getting all violent.

 (panting) (panting) You can't escape me! I've got grasshopper thighs and the sonar of a killer whale! (making whale sounds) (loud panting) (gasping) Uh, Bob, you can't kill us without a little singing, right? A little singing? If there's one thing he did not have to genetically enhance, it's his voice.

  Non piu andrai, farfallone amoroso  (tires screeching) How dare you torture my children with Mozart! Ah, you know Mozart? I call all music Mozart! We're here to stop you with the help of the teenage abstinence class! If you defeat this madman, I'll release you from your pledge and teach you other fun ways not to get pregnant.

 I think I might be pregnant already.

 Well, that's one of 'em.

 (all grunting and yelling) (groaning) Python jaw unhinge! Aah! I don't want to die in some old dude's mouth! (sobbing) Bob, would you look at yourself?! (mumbles) To quote Whitman, "This is what you shall do: "love the earth and sun and animals, despise riches, stand up for the stupid and crazy" (mumbles) Who am I kidding? My only exit is a final one.

 What?! No! Farewell, Simpsons.

 And, Lisa, when you're older, write an autobiographical novel trashing the rest of them.

 How veiled? Thinly! (wind whipping, grunting) (chicken clucking sound) Now, don't worry.

 Your friend will always be part of our drinking water.

 (water gurgling) Oh, right, I gave myself gills.

 (water gurgling) (groaning) (tango music playing) I told you, the only dancing I like is square.

 Hey, I let you pay for those boys' skipping lessons.

 Okay.

  Ooh! Ned! Ha! Sure do miss that laugh.

 Ha, ha! I miss her, too.

 Oh! I guess Grampa's coming home with us.

 Unless what about that nice dog boarding place? The really good one, where they each have their own dog partner.

 No kennels! You're right.

 Bad idea, bad idea.

 Should we just, you know, drive by and take a look at the place? (groans) Bad idea.

 Bad.

 When are your relatives going to be here? Can I be honest with you? They're not.

 We're all alone in this world.

 All I have left is a phone message from my late wife.

 Pick up the phone, big shot! I know you're there! You're both coming home with us.

 You mean it? Mm-hmm.

 Ah, just let me say good-bye to my girlfriend.

 Don't get fat.

 Honey, Grampa is the closest thing I have to a father, and I love him, but three octogenorous? Homie, Homie, we'll be old someday.

 (laughs) Speak for yourself.

 Glug-glug-glug.

 Chomp-chomp-chomp.

 (gasps) Beep (laughs) My lifestyle is my retirement plan.

 Oh! And don't forget my ripple.

 You're not taking your ripple.

 Without ripple, I never would have had you.

 Ripple's your real daddy.

 (chuckles) This is gonna be a swell flophouse, sister.

 So, where should we park our pills? What pills? Aah! (laughs) Don't worry, Marge.

 It's childproof.

 Oh, oh Homer, how are we doing with those cots? (grunts) Uh come on, boy.

 Your job is to guide me.

 Well, I really think you should watch your temper.

 I mean down the stairs, you stupid kid! Stupid kid? Do you really think that's the way we should communicate? You just want to see your old man trip and fall.

 Well, sorry to disappoint you, lad, but What the? D'oh! D'oh! Ooh! Not what I was hoping for, but it'll do.

 (cackles) Okay, boys, shower up.

 And I better hear some towels snapping.

 Muntz, what is wrong with you? Now, you get undressed in front of everyone that's staring at you.

 (all gasp) (gasps) Is that women's underwear? My mom can't afford to buy me clothes, so I wear her hand-me-downs.

 (sobs) (children laughing) Muntz, there's a kind of poverty that toughens you up, but this is sad.

 (children laughing) Hey, leave him alone.

 I, too, know the pain of hand-me-down underwear.

 My dad buys the underpants gorillas wear during monkey shows.

 So if you're gonna laugh at Nelson, laugh at me, too.

 Simpson, I won't forget this.

 From now on, you and I are as tight as whiteys.

  (all passing gas) (gasping and groaning) (electrical buzz) (groans) (electrical buzz)  (gasps) (electrical buzz) (laughs) (yells) (screams) (groaning) (whimpers) (screams) (bell rings) (laughing) I've had it up to here with those freeloading wrinkle bags.

 They pee all night, they cry all day, and every time they use Aah! Dad, did it ever occur to you that we're learning how to take care of you when you're older by watching the way you treat Grampa? Have you seen how he treats my grampa? Never visits him.

 Never even acknowledges his existence.

 Your grampa's alive? Oh, yeah.

 Okay Well, can you please be nicer to our grampa? For me? I love Grampa.

 You may not realize it, but he's a treasure.

 GRAMPA: Keep it down in there, you jabbermouths! I'm trying to watch C-SPAN2.

 Please? Okay.

 (laughs) You know, I love him, too.

 In a manly way.

 That never shows itself.

 Now, we're going to need three hearing aid batteries, all different and hard to get.

 And this has to be in the fridge, next to the butter.

 And the butter has to be open.

 Oh, I'll see what I can do.

 I can handle them from now on, Marge.

 Gentlemen, I've been thinking.

 My glorious youth and beauty won't last forever.

 Someday, when the leaves have turned and the moon has broken apart into chunks of floating cheese, I will be old.

 What's your point, pound cake? I'm hoping we can find a way to coexist.

 What did he say? He wants to see if ghosts exist.

 Ooh, they do.

 My Uncle Bill is here right now.

 Oh, Bill, Bill, I'm so sorry I wasn't a very good ladder holder.

 That's all right.

 Enough about that.

 Did the clock ever get wound? This can only be good.

 This family's had a lot of hoods put over their heads.

 Uh, Chief, something about that looks fishy.

 Aw, Lou, you got a suspicious mind, you know? You remind me of that Elvis song.

 Uh, uh, "Clambake.

" You know, 'cause you open your yap when things get hot.

 "Clambake.

" JIMBO: All right, take off his hood.

 Where am I? Our secret place.

 The empty swimming pool from the country club that closed down rather than let women in.

 (coyote howls) Now, enter the stolen bicycle graveyard.

 We've decided to make you an honorary bully.

 Bestow upon him the necklace of unknown retainers.

 Um thanks, but I'm not sure I want to be a bully.

 It's too late.

 You've seen our faces.

 (long grunt) Wow, never had breakfast at 6:00 in the morning before.

 I love yakking at the manager while he's trying to unlock the door.

 Now we'll talk about dead people you never met while we get a little exercise.

 (Homer sighs) When does the exercise start? This is it.

 Yeah, we're mall-walking.

 Oh, my God.

 This counts as exercise? I'm barely moving and I'm smelling Cinnebun.

 Sometimes you have to wait till you're 38 to discover who you really are.

 I'm a 79-year-old man.

 Son, welcome to the club.

 Now, say something pathetic.

 Uh, okay, um Oh, I can't.

 That's my boy.

 I-25.

 What letter? "I.

" What number? What game? Bingo! Damn it! Who's the icebox pie, Abe? Your younger brother? My son-- but he's taken.

 Well, I'm not surprised-- the way he tears into corn on the cob.

 Now, Mildred, he's a married man.

 You can't see the ring because his finger's too fat.

 Join the party, Abe-- there's plenty of room in my bed once they take the railings down.

 I said beat it! For the time being.

 Now, Homer, you stay away from those red-door hoochies.

 They're just trying to get a chicken dinner out of you.

 Hmm.

 Well, thanks for the chicken dinner.

 How did you know I wanted one? (chuckles) All you gals like chicken dinners, Marge.

 Don't call me a gal.

 Makes me feel like I'm your mother.

 (shivers) I better turn up the heat.

 It's 82 degrees.

 Huh? Are you wearing sock garters? Young lady, in my day Your day is my day! We're the same age! (gasps) You're turning into your father.

 (Grampa-like sputtering) You won't feel so bollixed once my Social Security checks start coming! They're not coming for another 29 years.

 (gasps) Did your ear lobes get longer? Falsies.

 (owl hooting) (cell phone chimes) Whoa.

 A tweet from Chester! Who's Chester? "Who's Chester"? Just the most legendary bully of all.

 They say he once wedgied a kid in half.

 Whoa.

 He's calling a bully summit for next Saturday night.

 Hey, isn't that the same night the U.

S.

 figure skating finals are on? They've been promoting it like hell! Excuse us, we're looking for owls.

 Screech or hoot? Either one's fine.

 That was an order! (hooting) Screech! Screech! Where's the Lord of the Fries? Actually, Homer got up early to count and sort pills.

 Then he called the police when a Frisbee landed on our lawn.

 Then he went to the drugstore for an egg cream, but he only brought a nickel.

 I didn't mind that he grew bald.

 I didn't mind that he got fat.

 I didn't mind that he got fatter.

 But no one told me he'd get older than me.

 Oh (sniffles) Say it, honey-- you're no longer attracted to him.

 Maybe.

 It's on tonight, and everyone who ever took anyone's lunch money is there.

   DEEJAY (over speakers): All you boppers going to the park tonight, make sure you're not packin'.

 We don't want any "accidents.

" BART: Ay, caramba.

 How'd you babies get here? Did your mommy bring you? Yes.

 WOMAN: Nelson! I might have to move the trailer house while you're gone.

 Look for me downhill.

 I ain't got much gas.

 Smell you later.

 Hey, my old weasels! How's Shelbyville Elementary? Not bad, not bad.

 We've ruined picture day three years in a row.

 (both grunt) CROWD (chanting): Chester! Chester! They say the day of the bully is over.

 Popular music condemns us.

 Documentary filmmakers expose our craft.

 And cyber-bullying has taken away the warmth of human punching.

 But I say to you, the day of the bully has just begun! Can you dig it?! Hey, why are you doing this? Because I don't want to sit around like Prince Charles waiting for the queen to die! Can you dig it?! (crowd cheering, shouting) NELSON: Ooh, I can totally dig it.

 (grunts) Chester's been shot! (high-pitched scream) (panicked yelling) This kid did it! His sling is still warm! Get that boy! And his friend, the kid with the lady's underpants! How does everyone know? DEEJAY: To all you boppers out there, be on the lookout for a sling-daddy who took down our main man Chester.

 This is KBLY, your source for bully news, weather and sports.

 by money taken from nerds.

 I can't believe you did that, Bart.

 I don't even want to sit on the same side of this car with you.

 I'm just doing it for balance.

 I didn't shoot him! Oh, yeah? Well, why'd you bring your slingshot? I don't know.

 I feel naked without it.

 DOLPH: Yeah, I get that.

 That's how I feel about my eyebrow ring.

 The only way out is on the subway, past everyone else's territory.

 We'll just have to wait it out here until we (all yelling) We're gonna have to jump for it! (grunts) No! I lost my flip-flop! Just keep moving! (flip-flop flapping) Oh.

 Well, well, well.

 Looks like youse and me may be up here for a while, huh? (fake yawn) (sighs): There.

 Yippee! Aw, damn it! I just had to get her parkour lessons for her birthday.

 You'll have to get past the S.

A.

T.

 Preppers! I didn't say to begin.

 (roaring gibberish) DEEJAY: Word on the street is that the S.

A.

T.

 Preppers failed the test.

 The Springfield bullies are still at large.

 That's right, yeah, so, uh, give yourselves up.

 Um, if I put on the radio, can I hear myself? (click, electronic feedback) (echoing over speakers): Wow.

 That's crazy.

 Whoo, whoo.

 Hello, Lou.

  I only have a-pennies.

 Uno due (groans) (all gasp) For Springfield! (honking repeatedly) Save yourselves! Today we are all Nelson Muntz.

 ALL (sadly): Haw, haw.

 Springfield.

 We're safe.

 I'm gonna kiss the ground.

 Loser! You're gay for the ground.

 Well, you're gay for homophobia.

 Wow.

 You just made me gay for tolerance.

 (bottles clinking) (singsongy): Bul-lies come out to play-ay Bul-lies come out to play-ay Oh, no! He's got three bottles! (singsongy): Clinky, clinky I know a place that serves an early early bird breakfast.

 Steak and eggs for 50 cents, and it was 40 years ago.

 Oh, boy.

 Yeah.

 Ah Oh, my God! I know that kid! We got to help him.

 Oh, I'd love to, but, uh, I'm sure that it's some sort of a holiday for me.

 Fine! Your generation did its part when it won World War II and created The Rockford Files.

 I got this one.

 (groaning) It's so hard running in sand.

 No! No! I can't be old yet.

 I won't let the ravages of time catch up with me till I'm 52! (grunts) Ow! Ow! No! (panting) Um, I've never really been in a fight.

 (sobbing) Now, let's go home, son.

  How did I get here? (passionate kissing, moaning) Ooh, what's your hurry? We got ten minutes between the kids falling asleep and the old guys waking up.

 (gasps) Go, go, go! GRAMPA: I hear smooching!  Somewhere out on that horizon   Out beyond the neon lights  I know there must be something better   But there's nowhere else in sight   In the city   Oh, oh.

  Shh!   


                





                    			 (bird chirping) (groaning) Hm hmm?! "Lisa wants "a dot-dot-dot guinea pig"? Mm.

 (humming happily) (curious grunt) (yells) (Homer smacking and chewing) (gulps, swallows) (curious grunt) Hey, Homer, did you know that guinea pigs are self-groomers? And when they get excited, they jump straight up.

 It's called "popcorning.

" Lisa got to you.

 I don't know how, but she got to you.

 (phone buzzing) (chiming) Emojis.

 Now she's gone too far.

 Lisa, your father and I are very concerned about all this hinting.

 (groans) I've never had a pet of my very own.

 My clock is ticking.

 I don't want to be one of those girls who waits till she's 16 to decide if she's ready, and then it's too late.

 (both grunt) Well, we've talked about it.

 And if you really want a guinea pig, you'll have to sign this contract.

 "I, Lisa Simpson, hereby promise to take full responsibility for this dog, cat, other.

" Circle "other.

" "This includes feeding, bathing, "cleaning of droppings and barfings, and when the time comes, burying or flushing.

" Boilerplate, boilerplate, boilerplate.

 We can skip all this litter box stuff.

 "If pet becomes Internet superstar, all rights revert to father.

" Sign here, here, initial here, one more over here.

 And done.

 Oh, my God! I'm getting a guinea pig! Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you! The kid-parent contract.

 Unenforceable, yet you feel like you didn't completely cave.

 You're doing the right thing adopting a rescue pig.

 You know, most of these guys are rejects from the big guinea-pig mills in the Midwest.

 Oh, I can't tell you how many mill pigs we get in here who have bumblefoot or the slobbers.

 You don't have children, do you? This one whistled at me! Ooh, that could be the one.

 Oh, but that orange guy looks like a pumpkin.

 (gasps) But this fellow is so fuzzy! Well, they all have their charms.

 This one's nibbling a sunflower seed.

 Look at that hair.

 Aw, I just want to comb it forever! Have you seen a pinker nose? (gasps) I have now! Lisa, you've just got to choose one.

 Lisa? She's gone, honey.

 She's gone.

 That one's fur looks like a tuxedo! A Band-Aid on its tail, aw! (gasps) Albino! I'm definitely getting this one.

 Oh, but I forgot about this one.

 Oh, my God, I never even saw this one! (gasps) Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh Maybe I should get that sick one.

 If I don't, no one else will.

 (gasps) Bart, list your top five, best to worst.

 No, no, no, no! Worst to best.

 I just wish the gray one had the brown one's personality.

 Okay, Dad, give me your phone.

 I need to look at the pictures again.

 Aw, aw, aw! Aw, aw! Okay, this is the guinea pig that will make me happy.

 She thinks she's decided.

 Don't say a thing.

 Don't blow this.

 Okay, now, you sure you only want just one? They tend to do better in pairs.

 (gasps) I could get two? (engine revs, tires screech) HOMER: Farting tweakers rule! I've tried to give Pokey a perfect replica of his natural habitat.

 Peruvian feather grass, an Incan sleeping mat, and a portrait of Marisol Espinoza, the Vice President of Peru.

 Are you sure you didn't create a perfect habitat for you? I wish I could live in there.

 Well, there's plenty of room because Pokey's gone.

 (Lisa gasps) Where'd he go? (squeaking) This looks like a job for fireplace tongs.

 (tongs clang, Pokey squeaks) No! (Pokey squeaking) Oh, my God! He's in the walls! I hear chewing.

 No, that's a much bigger animal.

 (grunts) Kettle corn.

 The heroin of the farmers' market.

 I've lost my guinea pig! (squeaking, tapping nearby) Pokey! Our boat painting! I'm sorry, Mom.

 (groans) That's okay, sweetheart.

 Your pig thingy didn't mean it.

 It's just, it felt comforting to know that while we watched TV, there was art going on behind us.

 (moans) Oh, well, I guess we have to go to an art gallery and buy a new painting.

 Sure, we could go to a fancy gallery and spend a bunch of money, or Mm hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm? Yeah, Milhouse played the violin for years until it turned out the vibrations were screwing up his bones.

 Yeah, these seem great.

 (sniffs) Oh, too bad someone used cello rosin.

 (groaning in frustration) (gasping in awe) Oh, my gosh, that's beautiful! I've never seen a painting with a lighthouse before.

 (Luann laughs) Oh, that.

 That was on the wall of Kirk's bachelor pad, back when we were (whispers): separated.

 Yeah, it's a great piece.

 I didn't have a mirror, so I shaved in the reflection of the chrome frame.

 This could be our new living room painting.

 I don't know.

 How about this poster of a really rocking jukebox? You know it's rocking 'cause music notes are coming out of it.

 Painting's only 20 bucks.

 Oh, please, Homie? I'll throw in the tiny violins.

 (Homer humming classical melody) Oh, it looks great! Well to me, it looks like garbage salad.

 But that's the great thing about art.

 Everyone can have their own opinion about why it sucks.

 I've got to get rid of this ugly chrome frame from Kirk's bachelor bad.

 I hate to think of the things this mirror has reflected.

 Hmm! Hey, look.

 There's a signature that the frame covered up.

 "Johan Oldenveldt.

" Here he is! "Johan Oldenveldt, painter.

 "Lived in Amsterdam, Paris.

 Prolific early 20th century naturalist.

" Ooh, I think this was painted by someone famous.

 Maybe it's valuable.

 We should have it appraised.

 Pfft! You guys are crazy.

 I never even heard of that guy.

 It's not like it was painted by Leonardo Da Vinci Code.

 Now, here's what makes art valuable-- One: nudity, two: holograms, three: something terrible happening to Jesus.

 Ah yes, seascape, marvelous natural light, classic use of gouache.

 You're right.

 This is an early-career Oldenveldt.

 Quite valuable.

 Oh, my God! I expect it to go somewhere between 80 to $100,000.

 (gasps) Nobody touch it! Bart, stop looking at it! But I want to see it! No, you'll wear it out! Baby, you saw something in this painting, and you were right.

 Wow, the Van Houtens owned this for years, and never knew how much it was worth.

 Think how happy they'll be when we sell it and split the money with them.

 Split it? Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa whoa! (cell phone ringing) HOMER: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

 Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

 Split it with them? Kirk and Luann didn't know what the painting was worth when they sold it.

 Yes, they sold it to us.

 So, now it's our painting.

 We can hang it on our wall, cut eyeholes in it to spy on people.

 Or sell it for lots of money which we keep.

 For ourselves? This dude gets it.

 (groans) But the Van Houtens are our friends.

 Are they, Marge? If you think about it, aren't they really just the parents of a kid who happens to hang out with our kid? All our friends are like that.

 Well, how would you feel if we sold them something that turned out to be valuable? I would feel A) Happy for their good fortune, B) Proud to know rich people, and C) Grateful for an opportunity to learn from a mistake.

 (door bell chimes) MARGE: How about this? What if we give the Van Houtens Then they'll just be mad about the 65% that we're keeping.

 Marge, you like kindness, right? Sure.

 So, even if we gave Kirk and Luann some of the money, the knowledge of what they could have had will eat away at them, like piranhas devouring a wounded yeti.

 It's kinder never to tell them.

 Okay, I see your point.

 We should sell the painting, keep all the money, and never, ever tell the Van Houtens.

 Mm-hmm! (deep inhale) (gasping) (deep inhale) (Marge and Homer gasping) What'll it take to buy your silence? Hmm.

 Okay, Milhouse, the guys in back are shining up your new bike.

 And all I have to do is not say anything about some painting to my Mom and Dad? Oh, sweetie, you want your parents to be happy, don't you? I guess.

 (laughing): "I guess"! You're funny! No wonder Lisa's in love with you.

 She is?! She is?! So, if I keep my mouth shut, you get me new wheelie sneakers, and Bart agrees to promote and encourage use of my new cool nickname, "C.

J.

" (Homer grunts) You got it, Ceej.

 (doorbell rings) You found out that painting was worth big bucks, and you weren't gonna tell us?! I don't know what you're talking about.

 (loud whisper): Hide the treasure! I'm sorry, Mr.

 S.

 I cracked! We had a deal.

 And now we've got nothing! (blows) We considered you our friends.

 We trusted you! I let Homer use our master bathroom! Then you stab us in the back! If you knew you sold a valuable painting for nothing, how could you live with yourselves? We were just trying to be kind.

 Kind?! You call it kind to give us nothing? We were gonna treat you to dinner at an upscale chain restaurant and never explain why, but now forget it! Oh, so that's how it is! That's exactly how it is.

 Oh, is it?! Oh, it is! (clears throat) Luann, I hope we're still on Thursday for collecting used cell phones for the troops.

 I don't think you need any help.

 You're so good at collecting.

 Oh! Oh, that was cold, Luann! So cold! Brr! Sarcastic brr! See what happens when we get greedy? Honey, there's something I want to show you.

 An ATM receipt? I don't know whose this is.

 I found it next to the cash machine, and I've always kept it.

 Look at the balance.

 Five figures! With that painting, we could have what these people have: a money cushion.

 No more living paycheck to paycheck, one lost retainer away from the gutter.

 I could write a check with today's date on it.

 That's the cushion.

  Tonight, a special report.

 Fat cat art experts take advantage of John and Jane Yard Sale.

 So, would you characterize your friend of many years cheating you out of your painting as no big deal, or a devastating betrayal? Oh, definitely betrayal, Kent.

 Interesting.

 So if you see the Simpsons walking down your street, lock your doors and hide your friendship.

 Great! Now we're raccoons, the masked bandits of the animal world! Don't worry.

 No one's gonna see this stupid show.

 (Marge and Homer gasp, tires squeal) (gasps) The whole town's turned against us! (engine revs, tires squeal) Ooh, a support rock! This one's against us.

 This one's for us.

 For, for, against, for, against We don't even get this many Christmas cards.

 (all clamoring) (all gasp) There they are, the Masterpiece Thievers! Ah, shut your bone hole! That painting belongs to the Simpsons! Sharing is what makes a community strong! All sales are final! Keep it! (clamoring) Finders keepers, moron! You really think we're still doing the right thing? Just close your eyes and think of the cushion.

 First lot: "Untitled Landscape" by Johan Oldenveldt, from the Collection of Homer J.

 and Marge B.

 Simpson.

 Let's open the bidding at $80,000.

 The paddles, Marge! Look at the paddles! WOMAN: Stop the auction! That painting belongs to me! (crowd gasps, murmurs) Dawn? Good to see you again, Beef Kirky.

 Who is this woman? Uhhhhhh While you two were separated, Kirk and used to be friends with banana-fits.

 (Homer groans) You told me you didn't see anyone during our separation.

 Uhhhhhh Madam, are you saying this painting belongs to you? Kirk stole it from me! But I didn't know it was valuable till I saw the story on TV.

 What?! I bought that painting! She's lying! (gavel raps) The auction is on hold until we can determine the true ownership.

 Our cushion! Don't bother coming home, Kirk! Aw! See what your greed has done? Ow! Anybody want to give me a ride home? Going once? Going twice? (bangs gavel) Sold! To the lonely auctioneer! Ah! (cheering, laughter) Thanks for taking me in, man.

 I guess I can't help but feel fully responsible.

 Oh, Luann, I'll never gaze from my thick eyeglasses into your thick eyeglasses ever again.

 What you need, my friend, is a Canadian Duff.

 Beauty, eh? So why does that chick think she owns the painting? Oh, Dawn and I went on a vacation to a resort island called Isla Verde.

 I bought the painting in a cafÃ©, but that night she ran off with a parasailing instructor.

 Not your fault, man.

 Those parasailing guys take whatever they want.

 It was never her painting.

 That woman will say anything to keep herself in electric cigarettes.

 And I'd go back to that CafÃ© Artiste to prove it, but nothing's gonna get me Luann back.

 (snoring) Okay, all I gotta do is take a quick ferry to Isla Verde, find CafÃ© Artiste, and they'll back up Kirk's story.

 That will prove the painting was his-- and now ours.

 Oh, Homer Simpson, that painting has torn the town apart, destroyed Kirk and Luann's marriage, and everyone's very worried about Milhouse.

 He's been playing Dancing Revolution for hours, but the TV is off.

 But our cushion! That picture has brought out the worst in everyone! Please! Just let it go! (grunting) You're not gonna let it go, are you? I wish I knew how.

 This is so exciting! My first time establishing provenance! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 Just remember, if your mother asks, I took you to a wine tasting.

 That's a terrible thing for a father to do.

 That's why she'll believe it.

 Hmm, this quaint artist community has gotten a little touristy.

  Excuse me.

 We're trying to find CafÃ© Artiste.

 Ah, yes.

 Top of the hill.

 Three discos up, four gelatos on the left.

 You can't miss it.

 It's right between the disco and the gelato place.

 Mmm.

 Hmm.

 Mm-mm! (door bell jingles) Mm Welcome to CafÃ© Artiste! Would you like a glass of Strupo? It's a liqueur made of fermented capers, the official drink of the island.

 Mmm! Sounds delicious.

 It's not.

 Hey, a friend of mine, uh, bought a painting here.

 Oh, yes, I remember that painting.

 And that is the man I sold it to.

 And that man sold it to me! That proves the painting is mine! And nothing can stop me from selling it and keeping all the money! I love art! MAN: Art? What do you know about art? You don't even know who painted that picture.

 Yes, I do.

 It's a Johan Oldenveldt.

 Wrong! It's a me! A what? I painted it! Me, Klaus Ziegler! Who? Mm! Oh! This is where I painted your so-called Oldenveldt.

 Prove it.

 Aw, crap! You're a forger? "Forger" is such a cruel word.

 I'm an art forger.

 Your painting was an early, clumsy effort which I gave to the cafÃ© owner to pay off my Strupo tab.

 Whew! Then why did the auction house say it was real? I have fooled galleries around the world with my loving imitations.

 Ziegler! Ziegler! Ziegler! Ziegler! Ziegler! Ziegler! What you do is horrible ripping off geniuses who spent years perfecting their styles.

 Perhaps you are the one who is horrible.

 What?! You only cared about that painting when you thought it was created by someone famous.

 Well, no, but now when I look at it, all I see is a fraud.

 Beauty is beauty.

 My forgeries give pleasure to people all over the world.

 The only real question to ask about art, whether it's in the Louvre or on a freshman's wall at Cal State Fullerton is, "Did it move you?" But, you still, I mean Oh, I suppose you're right.

 What if I never liked the painting and only wanted it for money? Then you, I respect.

 (groans) Oh, great.

 The painting is worthless, (glass shatters) this was all for nothing, and when Marge finds out, she's gonna kill me.

 Well, on that front, perhaps I can be of assistance.

 If there's one thing art is good for, it's to melt the frost which often hardens a woman's heart.

 While you're at it could you make me a couple more? I'll pay you in Strupo.

 (sighs) Perfect.

 Oh, now that's art.

 (grunts) Rocking.

 ZIEGLER: The Gray Troll, Brine of Madness, Angel's Urine, all names for the mysterious elixir known as Strupo.

 Though this fermented caper solution was originally used to dissolve seagull corpses, local alcoholics soon found Strupo to be a palatable drink of last resort.

 The noxious liqueur causes powerful olfactory hallucinations, gender confusion, and wandering mouth.

 So if you visit Isla Verde, be sure to say "ahoy" to the crushing addiction of Strupo.

 Strupo: lose everything.

 Shh!   


                





                    			 (panting) D'oh! (tires screech) (grunts) (bull bellows) (all panting) (bellows) (snorts) Children, you're in for a treat.

 Today's assembly is devoted to a special kind of history.

 (kids booing) Living history.

 (kids booing louder) End this madness! We have two guests who have come from Springfield! We come from Springfield! Illinois! 1858.

 Please welcome, here to debate the important issues of the day, Stephen Douglas and Abraham Lincoln! I appear before you today for the purpose of discussing the leading political topics which now agitate the public mind.

 (kids booing) Hit the dirt, squirt! Well, it seems the, uh the good landowners of Springfield Elementary are rejecting Mr.

 Douglas's position on tariffs.

 Get a room! I shared beds with men all the time.

 (chuckles): It was a common practice.

 Ooh, common practice.

 (kids laugh, Milhouse gasps) Please, good people! These are times of powerful passion.

 (grunting) Why are you concussing yourself? Why are you concussing yourself? Now, fellow countrymen, a house divided against itself Ow! Guess what, I also play Frankenstein! (growls) (kids screaming) Douglas is getting away! Skinner! I have seven other principals, and I've never yelled their names, not even once.

 You know what these kids lack? Well, certainly not a caring superintendent.

 (chuckles): Well, I, uh (clears throat) Respect.

 That's what these kids lack.

 So we will hold a contest to make them tell us who they respect-- who their heroes are.

 A contest? But, sir, we don't have any money to pay for prizes.

 We had to rent out our multipurpose room to a Japanese-American social club.

 (pachinko machines ringing) Tanpatsu! The answer is simple, Seymour: get a corporate sponsor.

 But don't worry, you won't have to compromise yourself.

 So, from now on, our cafeteria will only serve delicious Stuffwich's heroes, hoagies and torpedoes.

 What about po' boys? Sorry, Nelson.

 Poor boys such as yourself will go hungry.

 Now please welcome the star of Stuffwich's ads-- who lost 400 pounds eating only Stuffwich subs-- Ezra! Tell us your hero, and you could win a Stuffwich college scholarship.

 (kids exclaim) Then you can be a hero like me.

 What makes you a hero? I don't eat as much as I did! NELSON: So the chained-up dude cuts off his own foot to save his family from Jigsaw! (voice breaking): My hero is my mom's boyfriend who took me to that movie when I was three.

 I call him Uncle Rob because he robbed us! (sobbing) (giggles) Madame Curie, we just might have this one in the bag.

 (Ralph giggles) (laughs) My hero-- or should I say heroine-- dazzled the early 20th century with her scientific discoveries (gasps) Okay, calm down.

 Maybe he's talking about Margaret Mead.

 in the field of radioactivity! (gasps) I give you Madame Marie Sklodowska-Curie! ("La Marseillaise" playing) (gasps) No! No, no, no, no! (sobbing) Martin took my topic.

 What do I do? Oh, just make a speech about Dad.

 Everyone does that.

 Everyone does that with good dads.

 But with our Dad, it's like climbing Mount Everest.

 You either plant your flag at the top of the world or get frozen in agony forever.

 Either way, hell of a show.

 (music plays, kids cheering) People, please! Martin has left the building.

 He had an orthodontist appointment.

 (groans) Okay, Dad's my hero.

 Why is he my hero?  We can be heroes  Just for one day  We can be heroes (grunts) Marge, it happened again! SKINNER (over P.

A.

): Lisa? Lisa Simpson? You have ten seconds to get to the podium.

 I'm allowed to eat these! Our final contestant is Lisa Simpson, who was last seen leaving in tears.

 Near tears.

 But not in them? No.

 My hero isn't famous (scoffs) Loser.

 isn't rich Pathetic.

 and isn't in any history books.

 He makes me sick.

 He's my dad.

 What?! He worked two jobs to get me a pony, he started me playing the saxophone you all love (murmuring dubiously) and anyone can put a Band-Aid on, but my Dad knows how to take it off so it doesn't hurt.

 Well, ah.

 Oh.

 The trick is: wait several weeks.

 And when my Dad was a soccer referee, he had the guts to red card me, his only talking daughter, because he knew I was diving.

 In the history of soccer, he is the only parent to ever take sides against his own kid, and he was right.

 He made me a better person, because that's what heroes do.

 That's what heroes do.

 (microphone feedback squeals) (crowd cheering) I'm so glad I was forced to come.

 People, people we have a tie! (clamoring) Yes, which means that nobody wins.

 The money goes back in the school general fund.

 But we will put both speeches online.

 Behind a paywall.

 Now, please fold up your chairs and stack them.

  Cause I'm a grade school hero   Lisa never lies  I'm a grade school hero  And heroes never die  Just one guitar!  Slung way down low!  Yeah, one guitar!  Where did my lawnmower go? Well, look who's back.

 Hmm.

 Hey, Dad.

 Lisa, your speech was one of the nicest things anyone's ever done for me.

 When did you come up with the idea? You must've worked on it for days.

 Oh, Dad, you don't want the details.

 No one wants to see the sausage being made.

 There's sausage being made?! Where?! Homie, there's someone here to see you.

 Coming! I haven't forgotten about the sausage.

 Mr.

 Simpson, I am the executive vice president of the World Football Federation.

 Ooh! What you Americans call "soccer.

" D'oh! I'm sure you are familiar with the World Cup, the quadrennial drama unmatched on the planet! Oh, yeah.

 That's the thing the guys at the dry cleaners get so excited about every four years.

 I'm afraid there has been an epidemic of referees being bribed to throw games.

 From the premier leagues to the playgrounds, all has been tainted.

 We need a symbol of integrity like yourself.

 Of course I am, but how do you know? Oh, your daughter's speech went viral.

 (shrieks) No, no, I mean it spread like wildfire.

 Much better.

 Mr.

 Simpson, please help us.

 The rot is everywhere.

 In fact, I see that I myself am about to be arrested for corruption.

 You will have to take it from here, Peter.

 Yes, I will take good care of your wife.

 Wait, what-what does that mean? Mr.

 Simpson, I am the new executive vice president of the WFF.

 We need outsiders like you to come to the World Cup, as our guest, and ref our games properly.

 Well, no one has ever questioned my professionalism.

 Except at my profession.

 (groans) What do you think, sweetie? Dad, they're offering us an all-expenses-paid trip to the greatest sporting event on Earth! The 2008 Super Bowl? Oh, I wish.

 Eli Manning's pass to David Tyree.

 But about the World Cup, I need your answer now.

 Oh, sure, why not? "Congratulations on your purchase of a FootMaster-brand soccer ball.

" Thanks, book! Look, you got us a free trip.

 Just slack off and cash your check like you always do.

 I believe the sweet little girl in 21-D would disagree with you.

 What the?! I switched with her, Dad.

 My TV didn't work! Now I can watch my premium HBO! (groans) (humming) Well, look at you, using approved electronic devices.

 To try to avoid any misunderstandings in Brazil like we had the last time, I'm learning the language.

 COMPUTER: OlÃ¡.

 OlÃ¡! O que Ã© um paÃ­s encantador.

 PILOT: Will you please turn that off? It's annoying the hell out of the flight crew.

 I was just trying to learn the Everyone thinks they can learn our language on the plane.

 Do you know how disrespectful that is? (groans) All right, just for that attitude, turbulence.

 (plane rattling) (fanfare plays) ANNOUNCER 1: Live from Sao Paulo, we bring you the World Cup Round Robin Group F Opening-Round Match! Today's game is between our host country, football powerhouse Brazil CROWD:  OlÃ©, olÃ©-olÃ©-olÃ©.

  and Luxemburg, whose entire nation has turned up.

 (wind whistling) Got to hurry.

 I've got 998 square miles to rob! Ha-ha! The mighty Brazilian squad features the greatest master of the fake injury soccer has ever known: El Divo! (screams) (crowd gasps, cheers) Now let's play human foosball! (whistle blows) ANNOUNCER 2: And with Brazil maintaining an insurmountable one-goal lead, with 28 minutes to play, let's take a look at the refs.

 It says here, "Homer Simpson was recruited for his honesty and utter disinterest.

" ANNOUNCER 2: How did he get those shorts on over that arse? ANNOUNCER 1: Rumor has it, they employed a team of pullers.

 (whistle blows, crowd cheers) Brazil wins it! And a fairly-called match it was.

 In choosing Homer Simpson, the World Cup has met its goal! Andres Cantor, you know that is incorrect usage.

 I have no control! This job has taken its toll! Eu gostaria de um Hang on, hang on.

 placa de Hang on, hang on.

 Here you go, honey.

 How'd you eat the meat without the vegetables? Well, the stomach wants what it wants.

 (burps) Oh, I need some air.

 Ah, Brazil.

 I couldn't stay afraid of you forever.

 The only thing that keeps me from living here is that fish that swims up your pee stream.

 That is a deal breaker.

 Homer Simpson! I would like to congratulate you on your fine officiating today.

 Thanks.

 I still can't believe the yellow and red cards don't stand for mustard and ketchup.

 Your disbelief will fade with time.

 But now, I would like to know if you are as incorruptÃ­vel as they say.

 (heavenly music plays) Oh, that is where I left my cell phone.

 Well? You don't know the new me of the last few days at all! We will get to him.

 We have our ways.

 Well, what other ways besides guns and money? We have two ways.

 Two very good ways.

  Samba! Red card! Let me give that back to you.

 Get out of here! (crowd cheering)  ANNOUNCER 1: And as Homer officiates, looks like we've got a little action on the bribe cam.

 (crowd cheering)  Man, Krusty should get some of these letters.

 (groans) While you were out, the gamblers sent up gold-frosted donuts, a chocolate bowling ball and a fresh pork sandwich.

 Oh.

 How fresh? (pig squeals) Oh! Where's your mother? Went to practice her Portuguese.

 Mm "Selecionar conta" Ooh, ooh, "select account.

" Uh, perhaps you could select the English option? I did not pay $7.

99 for an app so I could use the English option.

 You Americans, you really throw your $7.

99s around.

 You know, you're pretty rude.

 (chuckles) Stupid lady.

 Give the donuts to the hotel staff.

 Release the pig and the bowling ball into the wild.

 Dad, is it hard for you to turn these bribes down? Yes.

 But knowing that Lisa chose me as her hero, without ever considering any other hero, keeps me strong.

 Why so quiet? I'm just examining what kind of person I am and whether I should destroy your happiness forever.

 Eh, why not? I'm listening.

 And it better be devastating.

 You weren't Lisa's hero.

 She just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero.

 Oh, my God.

 That's that's shattering.

 And now I'm a man in pain in the naughtiest city since San Francisco turned all nerdy.

 (groans) Where are you going? To drink until there's no pain left in my soul.

 But first I'm gonna eat off someone else's room service tray that was left in the hall.

 Now that's a broken man.

 Hmm.

 What the hell are you doing? It's okay.

 I'm an American.

 Oh.

 Oh.

 Okay.

 So, the rumors are true.

 We knew you'd find out your daughter's original speech topic was Marie Curie.

 And now we need you to fix the greatest game of all: the World Cup Final.

 Fine.

 Marge is always complaining I never fix things.

 Give me another.

 All right.

 But we've run out of sugarcane.

 I carry my own.

 All right, Homer.

 To begin your descent into hell, let us enjoy this pirated copy of Man of Steel.

 But beware: Superman was never less fun.

 (laughs evilly) ANNOUNCER 2: Here it is, the World Cup Final! DRY CLEANER GUYS: Yay! ANNOUNCER 2: Will it be a German Blitzkrieg or a Brazilian waxing? Nazis! Nazi harborers! Guys, you're both right.

 All right, just so there are no misunderstandings, you make sure Brazil wins, and we give you one million dollars.

 If I bet it, I could double it.

 But on who? You know that Brazil is going to win.

 Oh, thanks for telling me! I was gonna tape it.

 Remember, I'll be watching.

 Wave a Brazilian flag so you stand out in the crowd.

 Don't do it, Dad.

 Don't cheat.

 You're a funny one to tell me about deception.

 I'm sorry you weren't my first choice.

 In fact (sighs) I had my doubts about using you at all.

 Well, if we're gonna be brutally honest, that drawing you made of me when you were three was far from a perfect likeness.

 You put it on the fridge! It was pity-fridged! All right, you're hurt.

 I understand.

 But when I made you my hero, you lived up to it and more.

 You became the hero I thought you could be, Dad.

 Oh.

 Oh, come here.

 Everything's right with the world.

 Except that you're about to double-cross some gangsters.

 That's all right, brain.

 If I die, I'll be doing the thing I love the most: trying not to get killed.

 ANNOUNCER 2: This match is tighter than two dogs on a summer morn.

 There's no score at all.

 Even the slightest pebble could start a landslide.

 ANNOUNCER 1: And El Divo goes down! In the box! Will Homer award a penalty kick to Brazil? Do it.

 Do it! Call the penalty! No penalty! He dove, Dad! (grunts) No penalty! (crowd booing) I repeat, no penalty! No penalty.

 ANNOUNCER 1: The game, plus two hours of funeral time, is about to conclude.

 And with Germany the victor, two-nil, in an unprecedented display of rectitude and stubbornness by one Homer Simpson.

 I've never seen the Brazilians so depressed.

 (sadly):  OlÃ©   OlÃ©, olÃ©, olÃ©  You broke a deal with us.

 And we have lost a fortune! (gasps) Well, at least I'll die the American way.

 In a foreign country wearing short pants.

 Wait, wait, wait, wait! I want to say something! You have one minute.

 Wait! Let it get to the 12.

 N now.

 Um (speaking Portuguese) How's she doing that? I don't know, but she's my new hero.

 Yeah, I was a little surprised I wasn't considered before.

 Ah, your fluency is impressive.

 You can help my son learn Hebrew for his bar mitzvah.

 But I'm still killing your husband.

 First, mazel tov.

 Second, don't! Please, please! I'm a mother.

 Surely you have a mother, too.

 I do have a mother.

 Oh, she's right there.

 I'm sorry, my son.

 We owe a debt to the Simpsons that can never be repaid.

 All that she did was switch seats on a plane.

 On a 15-hour flight! You are free to go.

 (dirge playing) No penalty.

 Fine.

 (birds squawking) Wow, the Amazon is just like I pictured it after seeing all those pictures online.

 I've never seen anything so beautiful.

 (chainsaw buzzing) The best thing is I can get locally- sourced monkey meat.

 (hooting) (shrieks) Okay, Teeny.

 Take care of part two.

 (gun cocks) (hooting, grunting) and FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY Shh!   


                





                    			 (crow squawks) (The Simpsons' theme playing in 8-bit audio) (crackling) Yeah, how ya doin'? (explosion thunders) (snoring loudly) (tires screech, horn honks) H-Hey, what? Oh! Oh, cleats! (sighs) Homie, what happened? Uh maybe some easy-listening music will make you feel better about the story.

 Turn on 89.

9.

 (Marge grumbles) (easy listening music playing) Like most of my problems, it all started at Moe's CARL: All right, so the rules are every time the news guy says "senator," we got to take a drink.

 Huh.

 It'll be nice to let someone else decide when I drink-- too much pressure.

 (new theme playing) (quietly): Uh, yeah, Channel Six tip line? I just caught two senators doin' it in the alley.

 And me? I'm just a reliable source.

 Not "sauce," "source.

" Source! S-A-U-R-C-E! We have heard from a very reliable sauce news involving multiple senators.

 I'm going to read a list of senators, with possibly more senators to be named later by other senators: Senator Abercrombie, Senator Billingsley, Senator Beaumont (snickers) Hmm? Oh, damn, the plaster's flaking again.

 HOMER: Once intoxicated, we had a great idea.

 Hey! Swings! (laughing): I'm a kid again! (laughing) Oh gah I'll save you! (grunts) (grunting) Oh, the only way out is in! Hey, look at me! I'm going up a slide! BOTH (chanting): Homer! Homer! Best recess ever! (shouts) (clang) Whoa.

 (gasps) Help me, guys! Guys? (grunting) Don't worry, Homer, I'll call the cops! I'll write my senator.

 Senator! Senator! Oh, am I gonna die on a playground, like some uncoordinated child? But I did learn something from all this: the sprinklers in this park come on at 3:00 a.

m.

 Hey, thanks for throwing the ball back.

 Really.

 (sighs) I'll come back with the fire truck.

 I just have to get the kids to school first.

 Oh, are the kids with you? LISA: Hi, Dad.

 BART: Homer.

 Hey, guys! Why are you ducked-down like that? BART: Don't want to be seen with you when you're hitting bottom.

 LISA: At least we hope it's bottom.

 Don't worry, it's bottom, all right.

 (grunts) (Marge groans) BART: And that's why I was tardy today.

 And with that tardiness, you have at last crossed the boundary where I can legally apply physical discipline.

 Willie, cut me a switch! What about the one your ma used on you? It, uh, broke on my buttocks.

 Serves you right for eating jam straight out of the jar.

 Damn it! That's not even a swivel chair.

 Skate, skate as fast as you can.

 But I'll catch you-- I'm the Principal Man! That's the kind of education you're missing.

 (car backfiring) Oh, no.

 Uphill.

 The one place my car can't go.

 (gears grinding) (steam hissing) Uh, would you like a quote? Uh, yes.

 "Some cause happiness wherever they go; others whenever they go.

" Oscar Wilde.

 Uh, P.

S.

 Your car is totaled.

 Whew! Safe.

 JAILBIRD: Oh, not totally.

 Whoa! What-what are you doing in here? Hiding from the cops.

 Well, I can't have cops sniffing around here.

 Some of them might be girls.

 Can't I just stay a little? I only committed this robbery to help my kid.

 See, this is Jeremy.

 I need to get him braces.

 I always thought that if I'd had braces, I'd have smiled more.

 Hey, I bet you have a great smile.

 Huh? Ay, caramba! Bart, Bart, we're in whatchamacallit a pursuit! So why'd you come here? I run a respectable tree house.

 Just wondering if you've seen anything.

 Uh, word is you'll, uh you'll snitch for candy.

 You can't buy me with a candy bar that has coconut.

 Then maybe this is more your neighborhood.

 Nice real estate.

 You got a deal.

 So, what do you know? I saw a guy with a gun and a snake tattoo say he was gonna hide out on top of Mount Springfield.

 Mount Springfield, eh? Strap on your crampons, boys! Eddie! Prepare my litter! Lou, you are responsible for my oxygen, food, water and cleaning! You have to clean me.

 I clean you.

 Yeah.

 Dude, thank you.

 Why did you save me? We outlaws have to stick together.

 Outlaw? You? Stolen bowling shoes, and this "cage" for my pet.

 Oh.

 What do you feed him? My A.

D.

D.

 meds.

 (trilling) (chuckles) Um, listen, would you like two tickets to the school musical? My son plays the butcher.

 In Fiddler on the Roof.

 I'm busy that night.

 Yeah, lucky you.

 (indistinct chatter) (grunting) Huh? (gagging) (gasps) Are you okay? Don't put more in there! (choking): Going for the record.

 (choking) What record? Stupidest death? Aah! (grunting) Blagh! Merci beaucoup! Oh, well, you're very wel That's French for "hello.

" Actually, I think it Lucas Bortner, competitive eater.

 A fat kid with a dream? I can't compete with that.

 What does a competitive eater eat? All the glamour foods: pizza, boiled eggs, chicken wings and the big enchilada, which is not enchiladas but hot dogs.

 is the current record.

 As the great Kobayashi says, "Detekurutoki itaiyo.

" What does that mean? "That's gonna hurt coming out.

" Is Kobayashi the number one, um, uh The correct term is "gurgitator.

" I won't be using the correct term then.

 Virtually everyone uses his technique: Japanesing.

 Shall I demonstrate? Um, why don't I just go sit alone Oh, you're doing it.

 Ready, set Japanese! (choking) (grunting, groaning) That's not going down.

 (gagging) This happens from time to time.

 Maybe this isn't the sport for you.

 It's not a sport.

 It's my life.

 LISA: Aw, he's sweet.

 (chuckles) What am I doing? He's just Ralph with a dream.

 The dream of not ralphing.

 But I'm sure I could totally change and fix him.

 Can I join you for lunch? Um, sure.

 How many whole pizzas would you like? Um, can I just have a slice? Interesting technique.

 (chuckles) BART: Whoa.

 You didn't tell me you had a PlayStadium 4! It's the first I've seen it.

 Something's fishy, Bart.

 Where's the gift receipt? Where's the packet of desiccant that says "Do not eat"? And, believe me, you shouldn't.

 I have a feeling this PlayStadium was liberated from its previous owner and given to me in gratitude.

 Liberated? You mean "stolen"? You can't spell "crime" without "me.

" C-R-I (gasps) There it is, at the end! (doorbell rings) Oh, hi.

 Is-is Lisa home? Yes, she is.

 And who are you? Lucas.

 It's pronounced "Luca-dollar.

" That's my competition name.

 I'm a competitive eater.

 HOMER: Competitive eater? Did I hear right? I could be a competitive eater? No! You didn't hear anything! Yes, I did! I heard "competitive eater"! It's for people who haven't had heart problems.

 Then that makes me the Jackie Robinson of the sport, and you are the racist Philadelphia manager.

 Quit comparing me to Ben Chapman.

 I will when you open your mind to change! Oh! So, what should we practice: um, Vienna sausage; blueberry pie, short form; oatmeal, long course; freestyle baked beans; catfish-- ooh! Cow brains.

 Beans, beans! We'll do beans.

 Hmm.

 Never saw the pork eat the beans before.

 (both laugh) Actually, I'm a little surprised Lisa likes him.

 Really! Justin Blobber over there doesn't remind you of anyone? $800 to cut me out of that slide?! It's all about the money with those firemen.

 Women marry their fathers, Marge.

 So you just might be meeting your future "ton-in-law.

" (both laughing) Ton-in-law.

 God bless us.

 (gasps) You can do better.

 (Homer snoring) MARGE: My sisters are nuts.

 I'm happy being married to Homer.

 Most of the time.

 (groans) (barking) Ooh! What the? (sighs) (Rossini's "The Thieving Magpie" playing)   (slurps) (yelling) Meep, meep! (descending whistle) (gunshot) Hmm Maybe you're not cut out for competitive eating.

 Are you calling me not fat? No, I'm just I Maybe you just haven't found the right food, huh? How 'bout ice cream? Yes! I will lay some hurt on that cream.

 Oh, my God! Brain freeze! Oh, my God.

 Kick me in the head till I pass out.

 Harder! I'm still conscious! You must kick me harder.

 Okay, honey, I made you pork chops just like you like 'em.

 Twenty.

 Thanks, babe.

 Sorry you had to drop out of college to feed me full-time.

 Now give us a kiss.

 (Lisa screaming) (gasps deeply) What the? Oh, yawn.

 Another freebie.

 Better be a 64 gig.

 Huh? It's full of lame apps: Bully Avoider, Nosebook, Insta-Grandma.

 This was stolen from Milhouse! From my backpack.

 Where Puppy Goo-Goo sleeps.

 Maybe it's time to tell me exactly what's going on.

 Relax.

 Listen to the music of this bubble game.

 (gentle music plays) So peaceful.

 No! I won't let this go! It's time you told me how you've been getting all this stuff.

 (sighs) I helped Snake out of a jam so he paid me back in stolen stuff.

 It was an honorable arrangement.

 But I never thought he'd steal from you.

 Snake, eh? I never would've suspected the one criminal in town.

 (chuckles) You seem stressed.

 You want to suck some Squishee? Sure.

 (whooshing) Mmm! Careful.

 It's uncut syrup.

 They give it to horses before they race.

 (sucking, slurping) BROCKMAN: Jailbird, A Snake.

 That's his real name.

 Albert Knickerbocker Aloysius Snake-- has been arrested for a series of thefts and may be put to death under a controversial new statute.

 (gasps) Yeah, we had a law stating "Three strikes and you're out.

" But I thought it was "You're out.

" So I let people go.

 So now it's "Four balls and you walk.

 Right to the electric chair.

" It's, uh, much clearer, Kent.

 Bart, I'm so sorry.

 I just wanted to ruin his life, not end it.

 You ratted him out? (groans) He's got a kid.

 A kid?! I was crushed when I lost my dad and all he did was move to the Holiday Inn.

 I can still see him smoking on the balcony.

 He looked like he missed something.

 Maybe me.

 So you see, we can't let Jailbird fry.

 Time for the Sleepover Detectives.

 I didn't say there'd be a sleepover.

 Too bad, 'cause I'm wearing my pajamas under my clothes.

 And my swimsuit under those.

 One day it'll all pay off.

 (Homer humming jauntily) Oh! There's my magazine.

 Why, look at this.

 "What every father should do for his daughter.

" Oh, Marge, if you want me to do something, just tell me.

 Don't hide behind a magazine.

 Right.

 Right, right, right.

 According to Judy Kleinsmith, a professional freelance writer, fathers should take their daughters out on little dinner dates and treat them like a gentleman would.

 Then she'll expect the same from the men in her future.

 Wait, let me get this straight: Sit and eat? That's my punishment? It's not a punishment.

 But you can't just eat dinner.

 You have to be gentlemanly and attentive.

 Oh, I can fake attentive.

 I've been watching a football game this whole discussion.

 Not fake attentive.

 Real attentive.

 Okay, okay.

 I'll make it fun.

 I'll take her to that crab place.

 All the crabs you could smash.

 You know Lisa's a vegetarian.

 She can smash a salad.

 No.

 Homer, you can't just do the things you want to do.

 You have to act like someone you'd want Lisa to marry.

 If you just act like yourself, she might just um Oh, you know um She might marry someone like me? You think that would be bad.

 Homie, I love you.

 But you can be a challenge, like doing the Daily Jumble.

 Marge, you are comparing me to the most infuriating thing in the newspaper! Well, I was just trying to Oh I'm sleeping on Flanders' couch tonight.

 Ours is crap.

 (door shuts) So Marge says I gotta ask Lisa on a date.

 Sure you remember how to ask out a girl, Homer? Yeah, you've been out of the game a long time there.

 Guys, lay off Homer.

 Now you quit stalling and call your daughter like a man.

 Oh it feels weird.

 Just ask your daughter to have dinner with you.

 What is the big deal? Ah, he's doing it! He's calling a girl.

 Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God (line ringing) Oh, it's ringing.

 Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! LISA: Hello? Uh, hello.

 Lisa? I know your brother and Oh! Stupid, stupid, stupid! Calm down, calm down.

 She doesn't know it's you.

 (phone ringing) Ah! Hide! Hide! (Moe sighs) Uh, hello? Oh, sure, Lisa, uh, your dad's right here.

 Dad? Did you just call? Uh, yeah.

 Hey, listen, your mom thinks that maybe you and I should have dinner together sometime.

 Just the two of us? Ah, yeah, I knew you'd think it's dumb.

 I'd love that.

 See you tonight.

 (whoops) I got a date with my daughter! Yeah, we all been there.

 No need to act like you just invented air conditioning.

 So, you see, Chief, Snake wasn't stealing that stuff out of greed.

 He was stealing it to thank me.

 Plea denied.

 Warm up the electric chair, Lou.

 You're not done yet? The instructions are in Swedish, Chief.

 We got this from IKILLYA.

 Yo, I totally speak Swedish.

 Fluently? Um, ja.

 Uh, do what he says, Lou.

 But Chief But-but-but.

 Quit arguing and give him the little wrench.

 Ow.

 Ow.

 Ow.

 Ow.

 Let him out, Lou.

 Let him out.

 But Chief, we got guns; he's got a little wrench.

 It's cold! Y oh (sighs, groans) All right.

 (Wiggum whimpers, groans) Thanks for coming down, Bart.

 You won't need to save me a third time.

 You're going straight? If I get caught, it's suicide by cop.

 Oh, I don't like the sound of that.

 It means I get you to shoot me, dude.

 Yeah, still sounds like a lot of paperwork.

 Hair volumizer?! Cologne?! Hello, Marjorie.

 Homie.

 You look like an NBA coach.

 Yes, well, it's a special evening and I thought it best not to look like a monkey.

 Mm! Don't worry.

 I won't embarrass you.

 I will put my napkin in my lap, I will use the utensils provided for me, and if I our food is slow in coming, I will "blow my stack" in a manner befitting the Earl of Yarborough.

 All right, you've made your point.

 Hey, I can't screw this up or Lisa will get stuck with someone like me.

 Homie, I don't have a problem with you.

 Except your buttons are off one.

 Actually, this is a collar button, see? It goes like this Tuh! Is there no end to your fault-finding? Maggie, help me with this shirt.

 (groans) (Homer and Lisa laughing) So Mr.

 Burns never realized it was Maggie who saved the plant? Nope.

 Now, how's that drink? Can I Temple up that Shirley? Oh, I'm fine.

 (giggles) Well, have we decided? Uh, yeah, help me out here.

 What is the normal amount of entrees per person? Eh, one, sir.

 I mean for adults.

 One.

 No, I mean for adult males.

 Yes.

 I repeat, eh, one.

 All right, I'll have the lasagna.

 All right.

 Meat or vegetarian? Oh, uh Oh Vegetarian.

 (quietly): Can the red sauce be cow blood? We'll see what we can do.

 Is that Mom? Homer, can you come with me for a minute? Marge, please, control your jealousy.

 This is your daughter.

 We need to have a conversation in loud whispers.

 Uh, excuse me, Lisa.

 A friend from high school.

 Homie, I felt terrible when you said I felt stuck with you.

 But then I realized: I am stuck with you.

 I couldn't stop loving you if I tried.

 I'm sorry, that's all very nice.

 But I can't forget what you said.

 I know, Homie.

 I know you well enough to know you're not ready to forgive me yet.

 But I also know you well enough to know that this will work.

 Where'd you get that dress? Remember that sewing machine you say I never use? Well, I sold it and bought this dress.

 Wow Wow, that looks just like the dress you wore on Project Runway.

 Shush-shush-shush.

 Oh, right.

 I mean, this looks like a dress from a local Springfield store.

 All is forgiven.

 Let's have dinner.

 (clears throat) Dad, I believe we were on a date? Oh, of course.

 You're right, honey.

 I'll just, um I'll park it at the bar.

 Well, hello.

 And your lasagna with cow blood, sir.

 Thanks, Frenchy.

 I'm not French, I'm just pissy.

 Lucas.

 You're not competitive eating anymore? No.

 I realized that was unrealistic.

 Well, that's a relief.

 My new goal is to become whatever Adele is.

 Just call me Pound-Uca-Dollar.

 (chuckles) What if I just taught you how to whistle? You know how to whistle? Like with your mouth? (whistles) (blows air) Hey, I'm doing it! (blowing air) I sound just like a bird! (whistling theme song) and FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY Shh!   


                





                    			 (bubble wrap popping) (pop) (yawns) (moans) (gasps) Please let it be a bear that did this.

 (Homer groaning) How much did I eat? (groaning) Homie, you can't keep doing this to yourself.

 (scoffs) I'm as healthy as a horse.

 Horses only live 30 years.

 (mimics a neighing horse) (sighs) If you could just ease up on the eating after 3:00 a.

m.

 That's all I ask.

 Marge is right.

 I'm gonna walk upstairs, take her in my arms and tell her my good health starts now! Mm-hmm! Legs pumping.

 Blood flowing.

 Two at a time.

 (grunting) Heart exploding.

 (yelling, grunting) Ooh.

 Pepperoni.

 (grunting) (wheezing) (struggling): All that's left are clever last words.

 (groans, gurgles)  And so we mourn the loss of Homer J.

 Simpson.

 Beloved husband, father and poorly informed sports fan.

 All he did was yell "traveling" at the screen.

 Major condolences on your bereavement, dear.

 If, uh you know, after a respectful period of grief and whatnot, uh yous would like to have some coffee, please give a call.

 Thank you, Moe.

 FRINK: Stop! Stop with the wailing and the gnashing and the aye Homer is not dead! I have made a copy.

 I'm number two.

 (moans in excitement) You're alive! But how? Uh, well (clears throat, speak gibberish) I was able to put Homer's memories in the body of a clone, identical to the original in every way.

 I wanted to clone a sheep, but I needed to start with something simpler.

 Which he is, because his brain is fliveck.

 Oh Dad, you're back! Just in time for my recital.

 Somebody kill me.

 Now, Homie.

 I hope you use this second chance to live a more sensible life.

 Amen, baby.

 Did you make potato salad for the wake? Yes.

 That man sure loved potato salad.

 (cracks knuckles) Ah, hey, Midge.

 Uh here we are again, ah? Yeah (laughs) And, oh, uh, here, uh, my new card.

 (laughs) Yeah.

 I'm back! Coming through! (laughing): Yeah.

 I can die all I want.

 Frink's got Homers like the Tuileries has park benches.

 Huh? I wonder where I picked that up.

 Oh.

 I planted a Western history chip, but all you retained were the places to sit down.

 Nice!  Letting the days go by  Let the water hold me down (grunts)  Letting the days go by  Water flowing underground  Into the blue again  After the money's gone  Once in a lifetime Homer, you'll be all right, but, uh, no solid food for two weeks.

 Aw two weeks? (continuous beep)  Same as it ever was, same as it ever was   Same as it ever was (groaning) We are gathered here to mourn the passing of yet another Homer Simpson.

 Beloved father, precious memories, local character, et cetera.

 Okay.

 We're ready for the crematorium bot.

 (mechanical whirring) (pounding) HOMER: Wait a minute! (flames ignite) (grunting) (beeping) Don't go far, Cremo.

 Oh, Moe, are we doing this again? You know what? No.

 I'm tired of getting my hopes up here.

 You and your immortal husband can go take a flying leap, huh? Um, I am so very sorry, but, uh, this time, I could not bring Homer back to life.

 ALL: Wha? (groans) Stupid Moe.

 You just had to act like yourself, didn't you, you jackass? All is not lost.

 I was able to download Homer's brain into this flash drive.

 It'll have to do.

 Yo.

 Where's my body? Oh, you used up all your clones, you fat, fat, fat, reckless, fat pig! From now on, you're just going to be a face on a monitor.

 So, enjoy screen saver mode! Bonk.

 Bonk.

 Bonk.

 Ooh.

 Corner.

 Ba-donk.

 Let me just say this once.

 (screams) I'm good.

 Hey, kids.

 Want to chase Grandpa Homer around the house? I do! Yay! (Homer and kids giggling) After 35 years of wifely obedience, I'm married to a face on a screen.

 Not exactly fun and games for me, either, Marge.

 Ooh Goody Gobble! (chomping) (whoops) Liquid center power-up! (chomping) (sighs) How are you, Milhouse? Things aren't great with Lisa.

 If it wasn't for that squirrel that eats our bird food, we'd have nothing to talk about.

 As I told you when we talked last month, "I've been doing a lot of charity work for the undead.

" HOMER: Uh, Marge, excuse me.

 Uh I think I need a reboot.

 Just stick the tip of your pen in that little hole and hold it for 15 minutes.

 (click) No.

 I'm throwing you out of the house.

 You can live with your no-good son.

 Hey.

 What did I do? Nothing for 30 years.

 You're perfect for each other.

 No.

 No.

 No.

 Don't pull me out before you click eject.

 That hurts like a mother! So, Dad, what do you think of my place? Son, could you put me in 3-D for a second? (click) Why, you little! I'll teach you to emulate my sloppiness! (click) Okay, guys.

 Time for you to go to your mother's.

 Here's your mom's house.

 (rings doorbell) (sighs) Hi, Jerry.

 Hey, Bart.

 Great to see you, man.

 How are you? Great.

 Great.

 So, I guess you and Jenda are still together? Is she there? Oh, yeah.

 She's just getting out of the shower.

 Hey, you're looking good, man.

 You been working out or what? No.

 You're lucky, man.

 I have to hit the gym like every day, or I'm like (shrieks) (kiss) Hey, baby.

 Hurry, boys.

 We're going camping this weekend.

 But our thing was camping.

 Living out of a car is not "camping.

" (laughing): That's right, babe.

 (kiss) (groans) Bye.

 Good-bye, Daddy! Take care, Bart.

 Hey.

 Check's due on the first, whether it's a weekend or not.

 Dad, if I ever needed fatherly wisdom, it's now.

 (sighs) (roars) Okay, everyone.

 Jolly did a great job standing on her hind legs.

 What does she get? ALL: A goat! (goat bleats) (crowd cheering) Cheer up, Bart.

 You're working with dinosaurs.

 (sighs) I miss my kids.

 Come on.

 You're free and sleazy.

 I know some adult dancers that work with my mom.

 Isn't your mom 87? With social security a thing of the past, she can't afford to retire.

 I don't know how that happened in a senate with 99 Democrats.

 That one Republican is great at getting his way.

 (zombies moaning) Brains.

 Actually, Terrance, this is a synthetic substance.

 Devised for zombie vegans.

 Or "zegans.

" Meh.

 What are you doing here? You weren't answering your phone.

 I was worried you might have been bitten.

 Oh.

 Zombies not able to control selves.

 All we do bite, bite, bite.

 You, sir, am racist.

 I'm sure you're one of the good ones.

 Not to imply that there are any bad ones, of course, but all stereotypes come from a place of (groans) Ow! (moans) Still meh.

 (upbeat techno music blares) I don't think I'm ready for this, man.

 Dude, it's been two years since the divorce.

 Ooh.

 I love your perfume.

 Can I smell you later? Why don't you smell me now? Haw haw.

 Well, that didn't look so hard.

 You know, at my job, I satisfy ladies even bigger than you.

 Um, I feed dinosaurs.

 Sir, you have to leave.

 You're bumming out everybody, and you have, like, a goat beard stuck to your shoe.

 Huh? (groans) One, please.

 Mm-hmm.

 Huh? Man, that's some targeted advertising.

 After this procedure, you will have total closure from your divorce.

 How long does this take? It'll be over before I finish this (electrical buzzing) sentence.

 Wow.

 It works.

 I'm completely over my ex-wife.

 Do you take wedding bands as tips? Put it in the jar.

 One more injection in two weeks, and you're cured.

 But until then, you may experience some zombie-ism.

 (chuckles) Brains.

 No.

 Those are just teaching brains.

 They're like the plastic sushi in front of a Japanese restaurant.

 Window sushi fake? Window sushi fake.

 Ay, caramba.

 I have moved on.

 Hey, passable-looking.

 Sorry.

 I'm just a little creeped out by that screen saver.

 Nothing to worry about.

 He's been frozen like that for days.

 (moaning) (whistling)  Girls  All I really want is girls  And in the morning it's girls  Wow.

 Now I see why they call you Miss Hoover.

 You must have been vacuuming for an hour.

 Anything to please my man.

 So, was it good for you? "Good" is not a concept in my culture! Oh, my God.

 We went home with you? Not just me.

 There's Beppo, Boppo, Emmett Kelly the Ninth, Frenchy, Insane Clown Polly and Commodore Tee-hee.

 (horn toots) Brains? Brains? Garden brains.

 (Milhouse grunts) Spicy Mexican garden brains? Too much sodium.

 (grunts) Give me your wallet! (grunts) (whirring) (imitating siren): Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! What seems to be the oopsie here? (growling) Yay! I'm fighting crime! (grunts) Officer needs backup.

 There, back up.

 (grunts) Oh? The old Milhouse would have been helpless with an asthma attack.

 No breathing, no asthma.

 I love how you're dropping all your definite articles.

 Brevity soul wit.

 (giggling) LISA: Uh, what are you cooking? Nothing.

 You know, Dad really misses you.

 Well, I don't miss his nonsense.

 There's a lot of stuff he blamed on raccoons that I'm starting to suspect was him.

 Look, maybe I shouldn't have done this, but I've got him right here.

 Oh.

 Sorry, I must have recorded over Dad.

 But admit it.

 When you thought it was Dad, you were excited.

 It's only natural to miss a man you buried 127 times.

 (classical music playing) (whooshing) Hey, Homer, your robot body finally came.

 About time! (whooshing) Huh.

 Huh.

 Hmm? Hey, where's my junk? Oh.

 Whew! (doorbell rings) Hello? (laughter, whirring) Oh, you boys look happy.

 Yeah, but Mom's sad.

 Jerry moved out.

 (Jenda cries) I thought he was the one, Bart.

 I just put in a saltwater tank where he could shed his exoskeleton.

 And now when I walk by it, I feel like a fool.

 He's the fool.

 You're great.

 You're just saying that because you have to.

 I don't have to say anything.

 Believe me, no guy wants to see his ex looking hot or being sweet.

 Makes him realize everything he's lost.

 Wow.

 Wow.

 You've really grown.

 We should have dinner sometime.

 Hey, Dad, can you watch the boys? Sure.

 (high-pitched whistling) Body, to Moe's.

 Hey, you're kind of quiet tonight, Homer.

 (belches loudly) (whirring) (crowd chatter, gentle instrumental music plays) You know, this was a great evening.

 (in squeaky voice): Please enjoy your desserts.

 Man, when is that voice gonna change? (whimpering) Suddenly, I want a different dessert.

 But they brought us little cakes and Oh.

 Ay, caramba.

 (metallic thudding) Oop, oop, uh, yeah, open your stance a little there.

 Oh! Yeah, that's it.

 Do your worst, kids! (both gasp) Come on! Hug your grandpa, boys! (whimpering) Threat perceived.

 Terminate! Terminate! (yelling) (laughing) Kids are so afraid of being terminated.

 Looking good, Santa's Little Hybrid.

 Father, what am I? JENDA: Guys, sit down.

 Our lives are gonna change a little.

 Uh-oh.

 This is never good.

 This is good.

 Your father and I are gonna try to make it work again.

 Like a classic rock band whose hold-out member finally needs money.

 Wow.

 Everyone's back together except Gramma and Grampa.

 Oh, I think that's about to change.

 (high-pitched mechanical whirring and hissing) Aren't you going to work, Dad? One of us has to stay home with you guys.

 And your mom can't quit her job at Google.

 They need my help hunting down those self-driving cars that turned evil.

 Oh, you passed another rest stop! I am not stopping again.

 But I had a large soda! I said get the small! It was only 50 cents more! Let's play The Quiet Game! (groans) (groans) Now, will somebody hold up a one dollar bill? (bellowing screech) (screaming) (laughter) (thunderous footsteps, audience gasping) Uh-oh.

 It looks like we woke someone up from her nap.

 (laughter) Well, now that you're up, you can do your juggling act.

 (low growl) (laughter) (sad growl) Milhouse, you were supposed to come see me today for your final anti-zombie injection.

 (groans) Yes, well, uh But I'm supposed to be in surgery now, so I guess we're both playing hooky.

 (laughs) But, Lisa, if you want Milhouse to return to his old self, then you'd better bring him in for that shot tomorrow.

 But, Doctor (whispering): he's so much more interesting this way.

 (growling) Ooh.

 I see.

 Now enjoy the majesty of our prehistoric past.

 (horn toots) So, that earring I lost in the teleport, turns out it's in Florida.

 Yes! That's not a listening-to-me "yes.

" You're watching something.

 What? Me? Oh, that's crazy.

 You know, I knew it.

 This is supposed to be us time, and you're lensing a game.

 Well, you're not paying attention to me.

 You're texting.

 Yeah, only to complain about you not paying any attention to me.

 If I wasn't paying attention, then how did I notice you not paying attention to my not paying attention? Ha! Oh, I thought this time things were gonna be different.

 They are.

 You're four years older.

 Wow.

 What does that mean? Uh Hey, Bart, what'll it be? A tall beer and no judgmental women.

 That is so typical of you.

 What are you doing here? I have to decide whether to make Milhouse (sighs) human again.

 I even prefer the way he smells now.

 Some meat went bad in our freezer, and my heart skipped a beat.

 Phoo! You two don't know what a rough marriage is.

 Mom, I got to know.

 Once and for all, what is the secret? Why did you stay with Dad so long? Until I was eight, I thought he was a magical gorilla.

 Look, life's tough.

 It's hard to make it through.

 The only way I know is when you make a decision that comes from your heart, you stick with it.

 (sighs) Like my marriage.

 Or my divorce.

 Or my decision to support Duffman in his old age.

 Duffman can still swing and party.

 (wheezy): Oh, yeah.

 Wait, Mom.

 Does that mean you're going to take Dad back? No, I'm going to join him forever.

 (electrical buzzing) (moaning) (gasps) (laughs) Oh.

 (electronic beeps, tune plays) I can't tell if that was love, suicide or a a really boring video game.

 Lisa, your husband is fine.

 (chuckles) No residual zombie-ism whatsoever.

 Are you sure? Watch.

 I'll just wave this juicy brain in front of him.

 I'm gonna faint! Hooray.

 So, Jenda, I don't know what love is, but I know what it isn't, and we're isn't.

 Yeah.

 You're right.

 That's why I started seeing Jerry again without telling you.

 Hey, buddy, how, uh, how you doing? What?! Oh! You know what, Jenda? I'm not even mad, because I'm finally, completely over you.

 (whooshing) WOMAN: sentence.

 Wait.

 What am I doing back here? You never left.

 Everything that you experienced between when I flipped the switch and now was just a neural implant in your temporal lobe.

 Uh, you should look at my profile.

 Oh.

 Uh-huh.

 It was all a dream, and now you can go home.

 So, you're sure I'm cured? No more feelings for my ex-wife? I'm positive.

 We treat a lot of people for obsessions.

 (electrical buzzing, whooshing) It's a whole new day for Nothing Stu! Wow.

 I'm free.

 Get ready, world.

 I've got a whole new set of mistakes to make.

 (whistling) Uh, ol' Gil could use a fresh start.

 Weren't you just in here this morning? I've had a bad day.

 After 35 years of marriage, we've finally gotten it right.

 Yes, even my personality has gotten, shall we say, an upgrade.

 Oh! That's a bit of a whoo-hoo.

 Indeed.

 Lis, I hope things work out with you and Milhouse, but if they don't, I know just where you should go.

 Thanks, but Milhouse and I are in a pretty good place.

 Even though he's not a zombie anymore? No, that's what happened in your false memories.

 There is no cure for zombie-ism.

 (groaning) Dead flower from dead husband.

 (sighs dreamily) And I was a false memory, too.

 No, you were real.

 Aw, shucks.

 ANNOUNCER: Next week on Fox Television's The Simpsons: Sit down.

 You're not going anywhere.

 (gasps) Release the It ain't what you think! I said no mayo! Ay, caramba.

 (laughs) ANNOUNCER: One week from tonight.

 and FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY Shh!   


                





                    			 Oh, no.

 (exclaiming) (school bell ringing) (Barney belches) (whistle blows) (yells) (beeping) (playing the blues) (playing the blues) (tires screeching) D'oh! (tires screeching) (grunts) (yells) (grunts) (screams) (screaming) (chuckles) D'oh! Ooh! (groans) (mouth groans) Ooh! (gasps) (belches) (heart beating)   (squishing, blurping) Why, you little! (Homer and Bart grunt) Huh?! Eh, welcome fellow barkeeps, gin-slingers, and beer jerks.

 We are all here because drinkin' in our bars is down.

 Mom-and-pop bartenders can't compete with big box stores like Booze Barn and Hooch City.

 (bell dinging) (all clamoring) Uh, folks, this is the owner of the airport bar speaking.

 Uh, we're experiencing some financial turbulence.

 Uh, please remain calm.

 Now let's watch this informational video that'll help save our business.

 Thanks, Cap.

 Now what I'm proposing is a superhero pub crawl.

 Our clientele dress up in costume and go drinking from bar to bar.

 Their masks make 'em feel uninhibited and invulnerable.

 (all murmuring positively) Yeah, and that's not all.

 Why don't you tell 'em about it, Moe? Yeah, you got it, Moe.

 We can make up superhero drink names and charge 'em double.

 Like, uh, Nick Fury, Agent of Schnapps; Sex in the Batmobile; and Wolveriskey.

 Here, check out my, uh, portfolium here.

 (all clamoring, cheering) Whoo! Yeah! Flame on! (belches) (gasps) Oh-God-oh-God-oh-God! I can't breathe! No, no, no! Why do they call this a yard of ale? Easy.

 After you drink one, you're passed out in your yard.

 Hmm.

 (drunkenly): Well, better get home.

 The delightfulness ended hours ago.

 Homer, the best thing for you to do in this situation is keep drinking.

 Heh.

 (Homer moaning) (groaning) (Otto laughs) Oh, why are you doing this to me, booze? I drank every kind of you! See ya, Homer! Bye, Dad! Have a good day, you two! Don't be me! There's my dad! Wait, I think I just sucked up a dollar! (grunting) JosÃ©, hit the switch! We are not all JosÃ©s, man.

 (other kids laugh) Oh! Art.

 Simpson! Smock up! Every time I do art, some do-gooder teacher sends it straight to a therapist.

 Your stuff is pretty disturbing.

 I've never acted on any of it.

 You will take art, you will enjoy art, and you will make something in a kiln your mother can use.

 Oh (groans) Maggie! Why'd you do that? Oh, I just came in to take out the trash! And you shall leave immortal! Also, take out the trash.

 Honest! Inspiring! Yes necessary! Oh, Milhouse-ian! Oh, Bart, it's wonderful! Really? Wonderful? I just drowned a grasshopper in paint and let him crawl on the paper till he died.

 You know what that's called? Mixed-media conceptual art.

 No, it's not, because I hate art.

 Oh, then it's protest art! Stop encouraging me! I will admire you from afar! (exasperated grunt) (gasps) Shauna? What are you doing here? Training for the Olympics.

 I gotta find a way to get rid of my art teacher.

 Easy.

 Voodoo.

 Is there a voodoo queen you can direct me to? Oh, yeah.

 She lives in a trailer down by Yogurtland.

 Now kiss me.

 I wanna make somebody mad.

 (grunting) What are you doing?! What's my no-good daughter up to now? Now u have everyt'ing you need for the voodoo.

 Would you like a bag? Yes, ma'am.

 Paper or plastic? Uh, plastic.

 Just like the chicken foot say you would! Okay, did you get Trunch's DNA? Yeah, got it out of her purse.

 (chuckles) How'd you do that? Art teachers don't have a desk.

 They just throw their purse anywhere.

 Voodoo spell, voodoo spell, seagull beak and bone of Mel, purple heart and tear of chum (grunts) Just had to be tear of chum.

 Send her home with aching tum! Oh, right, we need one more thing from her purse.

 I've got these.

 Hmm, she's got tickets to the play God of Carnage.

 Orchestra?! On an art teacher's salary? That's black magic! Where's Mrs.

 Trunch? I need to know the correct density of "points" in my pointillism.

 Mm, sorry, but I don't think we'll be seeing much of Trunch today.

 Yep, I cast a voodoo spell on her.

 I won't bore you with the dark details, but let's just say she's in no condition for teaching.

 (gasps) (disappointed): Oh Class, I have an announcement.

 I'm afraid I can't teach today.

 I have a tummy ache.

 Mm A very special tummy ache.

 I'm going to have a baby! (gasps) Aah! Bart Simpson got a teacher pregnant! (scoffing) Typical Ralph nonsense.

 (Milhouse panting) Bart Simpson got a teacher pregnant! You happy with your two-timing boyfriend now? I admit, I did make a voodoo doll of Mrs.

 Trunch.

 But I just asked for a stomachache, not a baby! Classic wish-maker's mistake: vague language.

 So I did make her pregnant? Of course not.

 Doesn't work that way.

 Just how do women get babies? I'm not allowed to discuss that with fourth-graders.

 Fifth grade, you get every dirty detail.

 Do you know how embarrassed I was to get a call at my arraignment for my behavior during the pub crawl because of a voodoo curse my son placed on his art teacher? I didn't mean to make her pregnant.

 I just hate art so much.

 Oh, everyone does, son.

 That's why they lock it up in museums where no one will ever visit.

 So, uh, your boy's got magic knock-up powers, huh? Hey, I created three kids, and no one's making a big deal of that.

 Not true! Whenever I compliment your virility, you act all weird.

 And you are very virile.

 Uh, yeah.

 Just talk about sports! No problem.

 Wish I had that Tom Brady's libido.

 (shudders) Oh, it's amazing how many Cheerios Maggie drops in the back seat.

 Here you go.

 Put those in the trash, then you can help me unload the dishwasher.

 Oh! A minute of fun, a lifetime of work.

 I've never heard of a pregnancy like this.

 There he is.

 Jenny, this is crazy.

 Nothing's crazy at this point.

 Are you the boy that makes babies? I like to think I'm the boy that makes families.

 You see, Jenny? He's just a jerk kid.

 It's just (sobs) we've been trying so hard to start a family.

 With all the money we've spent on IVF.

 (sobs) You have no idea! Hmm, maybe I can help.

 But it'll cost you.

 How much? Five dollars.

 Plus one dollar haw-haw insurance.

 Trust me, the insurance is worth it.

 By the power of this place, make a baby with a face.

 That's great, really.

 Really glad we're getting a baby with a face.

 Thank you.

 (tires screech) Haw! No haw-haw! It worked! (groans) I'm pregnant! Look, Bart, I really, I can't believe there's a connection here.

 But, uh, we have some friends who are in the same dark place that we were.

 Can we give them your name? Only if they have five dollars.

 Yes, right.

 I'll make sure that they have five dollars.

 With them.

 Look, I'm sorry our check bounced, man.

 I can have the bank teller call you.

 Just give me the cash and you'll get your driver's license back.

 Please keep the chatter down while the Womb Wizard is casting his spells.

 Ones are appreciated, people.

 Barbeque sauce and teddy bear's eye.

 They want a baby, God knows why.

 Homie, I can't find my spatula.

 Can you get another one? Flanders, can we borrow your spatula? That was my spatula.

 And you never bought a replacement? Ah, too much aggravation.

 We just forego flipped food.

 D'oh! (grunts) Hmm.

 (humming a tune) Bart? Huh? Why, you little! I'll teach you to answer peoples' prayers! (both grunting) Yeah, you know, I just don't think we're going to get in to see him today.

 What is your problem, boy? Maybe when I've got a dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face, it sets, I don't know, a low bar? Wow, I got to take that in.

 While I do, have some bar nuts.

 Aren't those full of germs? Eat the nuts! They're your dinner! (guns click) You guys are coming with us.

 Not so fast! Nobody comes into my bar and kidnaps two paying customers.

 Aw, thanks, Moe, I Huh? I must've left my wallet at home.

 All right, take them, take them! Fill their pockets with corn and toss them to the pigs.

 Don't tell us our business! (sobs) Huh? Fat Tony? That's right Fat Homer.

 Hey! I need your boy to make a baby.

 Do you really need the boy's help to make a baby? Just do a little of the bunga-bunga, and the hotsie-totsie, and the bop-bada- bop-bada-bop.

 You sound like every doctor I've ever been to.

 But it's not for me.

 It's for her.

 Meet my filly, Cheesesteak.

 The love of my life.

 (baby-talking, kissing) Who has apple breath? You has apple breath.

 (kissing, baby-talking) And this horse, who I have briefly "borrowed," is the winner of last year's Springfield Stakes-- Rear Admiral.

 So work your magic, and breed me a champion.

 Look, Fat Tony, I don't know what you know about voodoo, but it only works on people.

 Horses? That's crazy talk! You will breed me a champion by morning or it will be the last sunrise you ever see.

 Don't over-promise, boss.

 It might be overcast.

 How'd you like a cast over your face? Well, as long as there re breath holes.

 You know, I'm just saying.

 Okay, boy, if there ever was a good time for you to find out where babies come from in the grossest way possible, with your life on the line, this is it.

 One more thing: It better be a boy.

 (scoffs) Anything else? It would be helpful if he could go undercover with police horses and find out what they know.

 (crickets trilling) Hey, this is all your fault.

 How is it my fault? I wouldn't be here if you were more of a role model.

 Pub crawls, naked Frisbee golf I just did that because it was a series of funny words.

 Well, it's your mediocre fathering that put me on the path to hell! Wha? Maybe you're right, boy.

 It's time I was a better father.

 And I'll start by saving us.

 I just need to facilitate some horse intercourse.

 Come on, buddy.

 Just make a champion thoroughbred, and we're out of here.

 (neighs) What's his problem?  It's raining men   Hallelujah, it's raining men  (neighing)  Amen   I'm gonna go out   I'm gonna let myself get  (music stops) Hey, you know? I don't think this guy likes girls.

 (splutters) Big deal.

 I don't like girls, either.

 Not like that.

 It's like this.

 (indistinct whispering) Smithers Mr.

 Largo Danny Kaye.

 What? Everyone knows.

 (neighs) Now, where's she going? Hey, I know that horse! It's Sudsley! Sudsley Brew-Right! (neighs) That horse was instrumental in me becoming a man.

  It feels like the first time   It feels like the very first time  (neighing)  It feels like the first time  (neighs) Ew, that tastes horrible! Beer transformed that cute little boy into the man you see before you.

 Hmm.

 (neighs) Whoa! They like each other.

 You know, pregnant is pregnant.

 What a you talking about? We're not lost, boy.

 Not by a long shot.

 We just have to set the mood.

 (gentle orchestral intro begins)  Let them play   We won't look   We'll turn away   Go make love   Then eat some hay   We'll be dead   Shot through the head   Be that as it may   Fat Tony's horse is gay   I do not hear no banging   No sound of horseshoes clanging   Roll in hay   Or tomorrow we will pay   I don't care   About tomorrow   We need   True horse love today   Here's a blanket they can borrow   Let them rock the night away   I don't really mind at all   But why must I go muck the stall?   Roll in hay   Roll in hay   Roll in hay!  (bottle shatters) (grunts) (steady banging nearby) Ah, young love.

 So, where is the pregnancy test? Right here.

 What does it say? The Pimlico plus of joy? Or the Maryland State Fairgrounds minus? It's a plus! We're having a baby! Hey, salute! I've never seen Johnny Tightlips so happy.

 Simpsons, you're free to go! Louie, drive 'em home.

 Cool, another limo ride! The limo's in the shop.

 We have a loaner.

 BART: Ay, caramba! You monster! My knees will be in my throat! There's another way you can go.

 Dad? Cheesesteak, a little advice from a mother of three.

 They'll turn out the same whether you gallop or trot.

 Teach him not to pee during parades.

 He'll get more work.

 (neighing) Now that's what I call a modern family.

  Hey, hey!   Hey, hey!   Hey, hey!   Hey, hey!   Hey!  (clamoring) The prosecution calls Sudsley Brew-Right! (gallery murmuring) Sudsley, on the night in question, how many did you see the defendant kill? (knocks seven times) Seven in one night? What kind of a monster could do that? A party monster! Drinking the new, convenient Duff Seven-Pack!  Oh, yeah  The Duff Seven-Pack-- one more for the road.

 There's nothing symmetrical about flavor! So get your seven pack today! It looks wrong, but it is oh, so right! Oh, yeah!  Oh, yeah  and FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY Shh!   


                





                    			 (snoring) MARGE: Homie! Homie, wake up! You're having a nightmare.

 HOMER: It's not selling out.

 It's co-branding.

 Co-branding! MARGE: Wake up! (Homer grunting) Oh, honey, the best part of every day is waking up to your smiling face.

 Oh Just like the best day of my life was when you (pop) gave me your hand in marriage.

 Ooh.

 (chuckles) I'd like it back, please.

 (barks) Hey! Drop it, you stupid dog! That's one of my wife's pieces! She needs it to reciprocate high fives! (Homer grunting) That's okay, Homie.

 I'll just grab another.

 Mmm Oh I haven't worn this one since New Year's.

 (sizzling) Hmm.

 Is it just me, or does something seem weird today? You're right-- something is different about the Simpsons today.

 Your father's wearing a tie.

 Oh, that's what's different! That's the one and only thing.

 Maggie! Stop that! No more playing with your food.

 Aw, they're so cute when they're Duplo.

 Uh, yes, is this a toy store? Uh-huh.

 I'm supposed to get my daughter a birthday present-- hmm, what's it called? Here it is.

 Perky Patty's Princess Shop.

 (grunts) (groans) Oh! I'm so sorry-- but I have an awesome excuse: I was distracted driving.

 Oh, don't worry about it.

 (chuckles): Good thing we don't feel pain.

 Hey! These are the monkey's legs! (whimpers) (panicked chattering) Come back! I'm a clown! I can't afford to look ridiculous! (school bell ringing) Hey, Bart, check out what I brought for share day.

 BART: Whoa! A skunk! Who should we stink first? It can't spray-- it's been de-sacked.

 Ew! The gypsy skunk-seller lied! (panicked yelling) He went in there! Stop it! If you pull out those bricks, the whole school could collapse! But there's a skunk in there.

 (gasps) Scottish steak! (students groaning) (both gasp) You are going to rebuild every brick of this school.

 This says: ages 12 and up.

 Age guidelines are conservative, and everyone knows it.

 And to motivate you, some words of support from the school chum.

 Haw-haw! SKINNER: Thank you, Nelson.

 (Homer humming) One Perky Patty's Princess Shop, please.

 Ah.

 Always good to meet a fellow AMFOP.

 Huh? Adult Male Fan of Princesses.

 It's for my daughter.

 Yes, yes, it's always for the daughter.

 Well, that's weird.

 I feel like I've seen this toy before.

 (rumbling) Do you like it, honey? I love it, Dad! Thank you.

 Well, have fun putting it together.

 Wait, wha Dad, don't you want to build it with me? Well, there's no dad on the box.

 I don't want to get in trouble.

 (laughs): Of course I do! Mm-hmm.

 Well, what do you know? I enjoyed playing with you.

 Me, too, Dad.

 No, no, no.

 Listen to me.

 We played and it wasn't boring.

 We've played lots of times.

 Of course we have! Because you're my girl and I love you.

 But I'm letting you in on a secret.

 When parents play with their kids, they don't like it.

 And I'm no different.

 Oh.

 Suddenly I can't breathe.

 Every fiber of my being screams out for a nap.

 And if someone handed me an issue of The New Yorker, (chuckles): I would read the fiction.

 I swear to God I would.

 Wow.

 But there are millions of parents in the world.

 Surely some of them like playing with Nope, not even one.

 Just look at the things you kids like: tea parties with pretend food; hide-and-seek with flagrant peeking; and the most inhumane torture ever devised by man (shudders) Candy Land.

 Oh.

 But this this is tolerable! (gasping breaths) What a crazy vision.

 I was in a world where nothing is made of bricks, except for toys! Hey, read the sign.

 Thank you.

 (whimpering) Marge, I'm telling you, it was so weird.

 My body was squishy, and my hands looked like snakes made of meat! It was horrible! Oh, Homie, it was probably just a mini-stroke.

 You're just saying that to make me feel better.

 Whatever you saw, it wasn't real.

 That's how the world works.

 Everything fits with everything else, and nobody ever gets hurt.

 I know.

 Oh, maybe you just need someone to you know, take your mind off it? Hm? I always need that.

 I only don't ask because being rejected (breathily): gets old.

 (Homer and Marge sigh) Oh, baby, I feel so close to you right now.

 (whistling a tune) (clinking) (shrieks) Hmm? Hmm? Marge? Did you replace our regular mirror with a magical mirror from a mystical salesman at a weird store that if we went back to find it, it wouldn't be there anymore? MARGE: No.

 (screams) Okay, Homer, get a grip.

 I'm sure lots of people, every time they look in the mirror, see a hideous flesh monster.

 Just a one-time thing.

 (gasps) Oh, brick me! Leave me alone! Why don't you go back where you came from! I have as much right to be here as you! I, sir, am in the Advent calendar! Hmm? APU: December 18, final week! Huh? Moe, I'm going crazy-- I need to kill off as many of my brain cells as possible.

 Well, I'm here to help.

 (clinking) (sputters) What the? This isn't beer.

 Beer is plastic circles.

 How can I drink (shudders) this? (mug shatters) Did you guys see that? Oh, it's getting worse! (shrieks) (grumbling) Ugh! Rebuilding the same boring old school.

 I could make this place so much cooler if they just gave me a chance.

 (yawns) (snoring) (sneaky chuckling) (gasps) What have you done to my school? I put in a rock-climbing wall, all the classrooms are skate parks, we got zip-line stairwells, Terminator gym teachers, your office is now a haunted forest-- extra ghosts-- and, if you can believe it, two tetherball poles.

 How will children learn if they don't feel like they're in kid jail? Relax.

 I used all the same bricks.

 Plus Ralph.

 Yo soy language lab.

 (groans) But I don't want to go to church-- I'm too busy going crazy.

 Come on, Homie.

 When I'm troubled, I always find solace in the airtight logic of religion.

 "Before the world began, "there was only table.

 "Then the Great Constructor scissored open bag one "and dumped out the universe.

 "Then came the time of the Great Sorting: "color to color, shape to shape, and a pile of just "windows and doors.

 "And everything was made of eternal, unchanging acrylonitrile butadiene styrene," or in the common tongue, "plastic.

" But, Reverend, what if everything isn't made of plastic? I think there's more to this world.

 You mean like decals? Well, the Orthodox don't use them, but we're a Reform congregation.

 No.

 I mean a place where nothing snaps together and you just can't toss your kids in a dishwasher to clean 'em.

 (chuckles): Oh, Homer, a place like that could only exist in some kind of magic rock song.

 Look around-- we live in a perfect world where everything fits together and no one gets hurt.

 Mustache is right.

 (others agreeing) But I'm having all these hallucinations.

 Like right now my hands look like they're these weird wiggly things.

 I think they have a name, but I can't put my finger on it.

 (congregation gasps) Don't look, boys! (pop) Wait! You guys see them, too? He's a freak! Take him apart and lose the pieces under the couch! Well, I don't find him disgusting.

 Oh, boy, that's mushy! Come on, Marge.

 We need real answers, and there's only one place we can get them! Let's see, "fingers.

" Come on, show me something about fingers.

 (sighs) Bad news, people.

 Our religion is not true.

 Sorry about that.

 Really sorry.

 If I'm right, when I touch this box, it'll trigger another memory from some alternate me's life.

 If I don't come back from that other place, tell my wife I loved her.

 I'm right here.

 Promise me! (rumbling) I can't believe all the time I wasted playing with Bart when I could have been playing with you.

 Aw Our little Springfield is really turning out great.

 City Hall, the weird-smelling bank, Rehab World Krustyburger, Krustyburger Express, the Krustyburger where the governor got stabbed Oh, you two.

 Hey, look what I found in the "Arts-Weekend-Obituary" section of the paper.

 LISA (gasps): A builders competition! We got to enter our mini-Springfield.

 We're a great team! We're there.

 I'll clear my calendar.

 Hey, Lenny, remember those two surfers we were gonna fight? Well, you're on your own.

 LENNY: But you're the one who sat on their fish tacos.

 Great talking to you, buddy.

 (chuckles) Lisa, Lisa, I spent all day at work making a Duff brewery for our mini-Springfield.

 I don't want to brag, but it really brews.

 Huh? Where is she? Okay, I got us tickets for the 7:30 show of Survival Games.

 I've never been to a PG-13 movie before.

 I wonder what the one swear word will be.

 What if it's (whispering) (gasps) Oh, I've never heard that one.

 My grampa said it at Thanksgiving.

 We usually don't hang out with second graders, but we saw your Survival Games book report hanging in the hallway, and we were very impressed.

 You really understood that the theme of the book was love.

 Hey, older girls, I'm Homer Simpson.

 That's right.

 Lisa's playtime partner and BFF.

 (girls groaning) I assume Lisa told you about the pretend tiny town she's building with her overweight father.

 Oh, yeah, it's gonna be mucho fresh.

 Come on, honey.

 It's time to click some bricks.

 I don't know what he's doing up here.

 He usually stays in the basement.

 It's okay, Lisa.

 We have dads, too.

 I have three dads.

 See you Friday.

 Friday? But that's when Brick-Stock is.

 Um, actually, Friday is the opening night of the new Survival Games movie, and they invited me.

 But this was our thing.

 I know.

 I'm sorry, but cool older girls have never wanted to hang out with me before.

 One of them wears deodorant.

 I don't know which one.

 Oh.

 All right.

 Thanks for understanding, Dad.

 What just happened? It's not you.

 Lisa's growing up.

 It's a really complicated time in a girl's life from age eight to actually, all the rest of the way.

 Oh! I finally found something I like doing with my daughter, and now I've lost it.

 I don't fit into her world.

 This is for the tacos! Ow! Tacos, brah! Ow! What did you build? Mmm Oh, that's the teenage crossbow ace who stole my daughter from me.

 Keendah Wildwill is a modern feminist hero-- strong, independent and resourceful.

 She's a little bustier than I remember.

 My work on that front is never done.

 I wish I lived in little Springfield.

 Everything fits together, and no one ever gets hurt.

 (yells) (groans) COMIC BOOK GUY: Okay Apparently, our whole world is a fantasy in the mind of an emotionally-devastated Homer Simpson.

 One of the main questions I have about that is, why? The real Homer fears losing his daughter's love, so he invented this toy world where nothing will ever change.

 How can you be sure? I have devoted my life to second-rate science fiction.

 Trust me, that is what we are dealing with here.

 So if I don't find my way out of here, I could be trapped in a fantasy forever? I'm afraid so.

 (whooping) I'm trapped in a fantasy forever! Kiss my flat plastic butt, reality.

 (giggling) Ooh.

 Daddy-daughter time will never end! Inventing this toy world to live in is the smartest thing my brain-damaged brain ever did.

 Nothing bad can ever happen here.

 Great throw, Homer.

 Put it in Tupperware, boys.

 We'll rebuild it tomorrow.

 Homie, ask yourself-- can you really live in a paradise if you know it's just pretend? Marge, who would give up eating steak in the Matrix to go slurp goo in Zion? We don't have that movie here.

 Now Lisa can never ditch me, and I can play with her forever.

 (sighs) There, I finished.

 All 12 of them.

 I'll never build what I want again.

 Then you've learned your lesson.

 Too bad I got these for my birthday.

 They always give me the school.

 (groans) Sparkle Unicorn, would like some more tea? Oh, yeah, hook me up with some more of that imaginary nectar.

 I've never seen you throw yourself into a tea party like this.

 Before, it always seemed like you were kind of phoning it in.

 Not anymore, Lisa.

 I've created a perfect world with no PG-13 movies to take you away from me.

 (sips loudly) Ah! 'Cause in a toy town, everything stays shiny and wonderful, just the way I want it.

 You'll always be my little girl.

 Maggie will always be my giant baby.

 Bart will never move out of the house.

 I'll work for Mr.

 Burns forever.

 Marge and I will never grow old together and live like fat cats on Social Security.

 Good Lord, I'll never experience the ultimate reward for a life well lived-- the gentle slumber of death.

 Marge, I made a terrible mistake! The fact that kids grow up is what makes time with them special.

 I think I need to go back.

 I wish you'd told me that before I bought all these groceries.

 But I understand.

 Lego Marge, you're just as cool as Real Marge.

 Who?! Nobody, nobody.

 Plastic Comic Book Guy, I need to go back home.

 Home? But you've discovered the joy of living in a world made of toys where nothing bad can ever happen.

 But I miss burning my mouth on pizza, and David Blaine stunts where he could really die.

 Now tell me how to get out of here! All you need to do is open the box back to your so-called reality.

 But I can't let that happen.

 Huh? You're the bad guy? I thought you were the rule-explainer guy.

 As an adult who surrounds himself with child's toys, I represent the part of your psyche that prefers this artificial world.

 (rhythmic clicking, gate clangs shut) How did you do that?! Because, as the ultimate collector, I have every play set ever made.

 (creaking) Huh? (gasps) Pirates! (whooshing, grunting) Pajama guys! (gasps) I'll never get home.

 Who could build something awesome enough to save me? Who? Who?! Who?! Don't you even think about it.

 (whirring) You are thinking about it, aren't you? (whimpering) (loud, rhythmic thudding) You are going back where you came from-- Denmark.

 What is that thing? I have no idea, but it's gonna kick his butt.

 That robot is made out of Batmobile, Hobbit hole and SpongeBob play sets.

 That's that's mis-set-genation.

 (in robotic voice): Kid power.

 BART: Lion blast! (whirring, rapid gunfire) Lightsaber barf! (click, whirring, whooshing) Fire Principal! This is strangely exhilarating.

 No.

 No.

 (crying): No! I am going to enjoy playing with this thing forever! (Bart grunting) I'm a creative but undisciplined builder! (Homer grunts, Comic Book Guy groans) (anxious whimpering) (magical whirring) Good-bye, Homie.

 Your squishy meat family is lucky to have a good man like you.

 Oh, baby, no matter what the reality, you're the best thing in it.

 Hmm.

 That was a little weird, right? (laughs) A little bit.

 (whirring) (yelling) LISA: Dad, wake up.

 Wake up.

 Oh, Meat Lisa, it's you.

 Are you okay? Oh, I had this crazy dream where I was in a world made of Lego bricks and learned important lessons about parenting.

 Mmm, isn't that kind of the plot of the? No.

 No, it's not.

 It's a new plot.

 Honey, what are you doing here? I thought you were going to your movie.

 I changed my mind.

 I knew how much this meant to you.

 No, no, go to the movie with your friends.

 If there's one thing I've learned, it's that I can't stop you from growing up.

 I love you, Dad.

 Me, too, little girl.

   and FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY Thayson, Joshuel, don't make me pick between you two on the night before I reenter the Struggle Dome again.

 We'll never stop loving you, even if you string us along forever.

 Forever.

 Forever.

 How can I choose between two boys, one who's dangerous but good-looking, the other who's strong but super cute? ALL (sighing): Ah! Oh, my God, this is terrible.

 When do they get to killing the children? Shh! Wait a second.

 You're not into this Shh! She's trying on dresses.

 Oh, I just wanted to see kids fight to the death, is all.

 Shh! Shh!   


                





                    			 D'oh! (tires screeching) (grunts) What the?! Well, this is a no-brainer.

 Woo-hoo! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! (groans) Now what? (screams) (Marge humming)   (laughing)   (whirring) Mom, it's not funny if I can't hear the cats drown in their own barf.

 (screaming) (whirring louder) (retching continues louder) Why can't kids still watch Captain Kangaroo?! Culture's in decline.

 Deal with it.

 (groans): Oh! (whirring louder) (laughs) Yay! A mess! Ooh! Can I lick the ceiling? (groans): Oh.

 I was making that cake for the block party today.

 Now there's no choice but to go store-bought.

 (humming) (over P.

A.

): I need a price check on Gramma Shortcut's Store-bought Bundt Cake.

 (crowd gasps) Keep it! Let's go! We've got some put-backs.

 Roger dodger, boss.

 Hey, don't turn old man on me.

 You know, I used to be the buyer for the whole chain-- You heard of the A&amp;P? Well, we used to be the J&amp;G.

  You like what you see at the J&amp;G   They're used to be three, but we lost the "Z" and  If I make out with you, will you shut up? Ah, give it a shot.

 (moans) You know, we used to give out gray stamps.

 Remember green stamps? Ours was gray.

 Attention block party losers! We are Ear Poison! (electric guitar riff plays)  There were bells on a hill   But I never heard them ringing   No, I never  (gasps) (British accent): We must have the same recipe.

 Drive to store, buy cheap cake, serves them right.

 Booth Wilkes-John.

 My wife and I just moved here from London.

 Marge Simpson.

 Congratulations on Little King George.

 Well, Marge, my wife and I are hosting a get-to-know-you game night on Saturday next-- or as you call it, next Saturday.

 Ooh! Game night? You know? Adult games.

 Well, not "adult games," fun games, like Charades-- or as you call it, Pictionary.

 It sounds like fun.

 I'll just tell Homer and Homer, for the last time, do not drink the Yahtzee dice.

 Fine.

 (grunts) Ooh! Doubles.

 Mm, I don't know.

 We have church the next morning, starts at 11:00.

 Oh, we're going to the game night.

 Moving church to Monday afternoon.

 (groans) Well, if you change your mind, please let us know.

 We could become "couples friends.

" Now, let me try some of Ned Flanders' No Alarm Chili.

 You'll only taste the spoon.

 Brilliant.

 Why don't we have any couples friends? (groans) Because couples friends are a myth, started by restaurants with tables for four.

 I want friends! Any friends.

 Okay, sweetie.

 I'll call the Van Houtens.

 Not the Van Houtens.

 But They're always bragging about their trip to Rome.

 It was 12 years ago, and it was a layover.

 I want new friends.

 LISA: Can I make an observation? I'm okay with no friends.

 It's easier to focus, and it'll give me great material for whatever art form I choose.

 Right now, I'm thinking long novella.

 Good night.

 Okay with no friends? That's the saddest thing I can imagine my daughter saying to me.

 BART: I can think of worse.

 The saddest thing would be if you were driving and texting Lisa and you hit her.

 And the last thing she texted before she died was, "I got your message.

" Good night.

 Well, they all make good points.

 ANNOUNCER: And now, the moment of truth on Topiary Wars.

 This Taj Mahal should be floated down the Ganges.

 I'm sorry, Cathy.

 Turn in your shears and ladders.

 Come and get 'em! (laughs maniacally) (grunting) Oh! Thank you.

 Why was that on the Military History Channel? We're going to that game party, and we're going to be charming and witty.

 You're not going to eat too much, and we're not going to stay too late.

 MARGE: You will not sing unless there's a sing-along, and never take the tray out of the caterer's hand.

 Don't be too loud, and don't be too quiet.

 When you're too quiet, you get that psycho look.

 (jittering) And stay in the living room.

 Don't go to their kids' room and watch a basketball game.

 Can I check out what toys they have? No.

 (groans) Dinner party at the neighbors'.

 At least I can drink.

 One drink.

 Wha?! Walking distance, Marge! I've been looking forward to this all week.

 DUFFMAN: Don't show your wife this app! Powering down! You were charming enough to win me, and that day you didn't have a drink in you.

 Marge! Homer! Mwah! Mwah! (quietly): Homer.

 You know, I have more cheeks.

 (chuckles) I'd like you to meet my wife Wallis.

 (deep voice): How ya doin'? Wallis has unearthed the most delightful entertainment to thrill us for hours on end.

 It's a murder mystery, and we're all suspects.

 (crowd gasps) Great! I've always wanted to try and solve a crime.

 (crowd gasps) Please, everyone, read your bio.

 (gasps) I am a humble farmer from Yorkshire.

 Humble I can be! That's the spirit! Wallis and I have found this game to provide a full evening of divertissement, building in suspense to a masterful climax.

 We've rented costumes you'll find accurate to period and conducive to character.

 We will serve food and wine appropriate to period and palette.

 (excited murmuring) We've programmed music to cover every dramatic event.

 Hired a Foley artist.

 (steady galloping) I believe the mare has a slight limp.

 (erratic galloping) Yes.

 Yes! So, for the next three hours, I welcome you to the moors of Question.

 Uh, it says here the murderer is Admiral Wainsworth.

 Who's that? (crowd groaning, murmuring) You've you-you've given away the game! Well, you know Why you! (both grunting) Thank you so much! Now Wallis will once again withdraw into melancholia! (monotonous): Birth, school, work, death.

 Worth, drool, shirk, breath.

 Mirth, cruel, quirk, meth.

 Just so you know, mer, you were going to be a dashing Russian count with multiple lovers! Well, as we say in Russia, "Good-bye in Russian!" Do svidaniya! Uh, nice night for a walk.

 (sighs) I'd like to be alone for a while.

 You want to be more alone? Yes.

 More? Mm-hmm.

 What the?! D'oh! (groaning) That's good.

 Okay, I slept on the couch and I flipped the sweaty cushions over.

 What else can I do? It's okay.

 I mean, those people didn't even want us at that party in the first place.

 I think it's time we learn to live with being ostracized.

 Mmm Don't you dare say "ostrich eyes"! Because uh Oh! Oh, okay, okay! What should we do? Nothing.

 I give up.

 No more dinner parties.

 Our whole social life will be us watching TV and you going to Moe's.

 I see.

 (quietly): Woo-hoo! (rattles) Well, if that's how you think it has to be.

 Yes, for us.

 But not for Lisa.

 Never for Lisa.

 We're going to help her make friends.

 It might be easier with Maggie.

 She's always getting letters from the day care center.

 Those are past-due bills.

 They'll get their blood money.

 And Lisa will get a friend.

 After this, we'll do makeovers.

 (groans) So where are all the friends? I don't know.

 I invited everyone that Lisa's ever met.

 Who are you? Gus Huebner.

 I was on Lisa's coed soccer team two years ago.

 Well, Lisa's gonna be here in five minutes, and the only kid who showed up is Gus freakin' Huebner.

 Watch your mouth.

 (groans) Oh, no, you're right, Homer.

 Abort! Abort! Oh, no.

 I was the only chump who showed up at this train wreck.

 Well, I'm not leaving till I get a party.

 Fine, fine.

 Homer, give him a party.

 (The Streets of San Francisco theme playing) (Homer shouts) Gus Huebner? Is that you? (chuckles): I wish.

 That kid can play youth soccer.

 Are you guys okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

 I'm fine.

 Yeah.

 That's Nothing's going on.

 Right, right.

 Nothing.

 What's for dinner? Pizza.

 Mmm.

 Lots of pizza.

 So, as her teacher, I was wondering if you could tell me why Lisa has such trouble making friends.

 Marge, this is when I normally eat lunch.

 So I'll just tell you Lisa is unique.

 And we're done.

 All right.

 For some reason, square dancing is a part of the gym curriculum.

 Now, I'm gonna open the divider to the girls' gym, and if you don't find a dance partner within ten seconds, there is something very wrong with you!   Hmm.

 (groans) Aw.

 That's tough luck, Lisa.

 Looks like you're dancing with Groundskeeper Willie.

 Careful of your toes.

 I got me cleats on! I'll dance with Lisa.

 Tumi? But you're from the other second grade.

 We only come together for tornado drills.

 (groans) God, I hate square dancing.

 It ain't gym class if a fat kid's not crying.

 Let's do this thing.

 (plucking notes) (playing lively music)  Swing your partner, swing her hard   Do-si-do while I bombard  Hey! Ha! Ho! Ha!  Do-si-do while I bombard   Oh, thank God, the clock says 3:00   'Cause I have to take a pee.

  (school bell ringing) Finally.

 But I won't push it, I promise.

 See ya.

 Oh, wait, wait, wait.

 Um, I was going to All Sales Vinyl after school.

 The vintage record store? Yeah.

 You want to come with me? At the risk of sounding like a broken record, yes, yes, yes! ("Stolen Moments" by Oliver Nelson playing) (strained): They will fit.

 They will fit.

 (grunts) Yes! Hmm.

 Nobody likes jazz that much.

 Even the guy playing it had to take drugs.

 It's so much fun to finally have a friend who likes the NPR show Wait Wait Don't Tell Me! as much as I do.

 PETER SAGAL: So, Carl Kasell, how did the House Minority Whip do on our news quiz? CARL KASELL: Well, Peter, he got two out of three right, so he wins me recording his outgoing message.

 MAN: Oh, that's okay.

 Really.

 No, no, no.

 Please don't.

 KASELL: It's not optional.

 (both giggling) See, Marge? Problems will work themselves out if you just leave them alone.

 Mm-hmm.

 Want some more smoothie? As long as you load up on the kale and chia.

 Oh, no one likes veggie smoothies that much.

 Or at all.

 Hmm.

 Something's fishy about that girl, and I'm gonna follow her till I find out what.

 And I'm gonna help you.

 I think I'll need you back at headquarters manning the phones.

 Great.

 What do I say? Just let 'em ring.

 Got it!  They smile in your face   All the time they want to take your place   The backstabbers   Backstabbers   They smile in your face   All the time they want to take your place   The backstabbers   Backstabbers   All you fellas who have someone   And you really care   Yeah, yeah   Then it's all of you fellas   Low-down, dirty.

  What do you want? I've got two things for you.

 This envelope will change your life for the low, low price of five dollars, and I'll throw in a piece of great advice.

 Tempted? What's the advice? Don't open the envelope.

 (snickers) Oh, God, I'm gonna be sick.

 (gasps) Mom paid her to be my friend? (crying) That's mine.

 It's for my library card.

 (groans) You don't want to be here.

 (whimpers) Neither do you! (whimpers) Mom, how could you pay someone to be my friend? Answer me! Oh, I wouldn't say I paid someone to be your friend.

 I just gave her money for records and ice cream.

 HOMER: You gave away ice cream?! I would've found a friend eventually.

 You couldn't wait a damn decade until I got into college? (crying) Oh, Lisa.

 Lisa, wait! (crying) Oh, God, oh, God.

 I'm the smart parent.

 I'm sorry she rejected your "I'm Sorry" cake, but, in a way, I'm not.

 I guess what I'm trying to say is I like cake.

 Marge, don't feel bad.

 You did what any parent would do.

 No, I think I went too far.

 Let me tell you a little story about a chubby unpopular boy named Homer.

 Is that the boy you named me after? It is you, you idiot! Whoa.

 Little Homer had a devil of a time making friends.

 No one wanted to come visit him.

 So I decided to take matters into my own hands.

 I paid a couple of boys, Lenny and Carl, to make my Homer feel loved.

 A relationship I continued to this day.

 You pay Lenny and Carl to be my friends?! Yes, but Barney's yours for nothing.

 Aw.

 Hmm.

 Well, that makes me feel better.

 (lock clicks) Lisa's door is unlocked! Dad, is that story really true? (laughs) I wouldn't pay ten cents to a lion to stop him from eating you! (groans) Lisa, just say something to me.

 I'm gonna tell every psychiatrist I ever go to what you did.

 (voice breaking): A mother's greatest fear.

 (crying) LISA: Wow, I made Mom cry.

 What unimaginable power.

 I can use this to get anything I want.

 But right now, all I want is for Mom to stop crying.

 Mom, stop! Stop! Stop.

 I'm sorry.

 Oh Please stop! (cries, snorts) (sighs) You're not mad anymore? I'm fine.

 Fine.

 It's funny, but hurting your feelings made me feel better.

 Mm, try to forget that.

 But when I grow up, I'll find other weird kids, and we will have the most intense relationships ever.

 And I'll always love you.

 Aw.

 Happy Mother's Day.

 Mother's Day?! Mother's Day?! Crap! Okay, initially I was just gonna be your friend till I could afford a nice belt.

 But I like you, Lisa, and I want to keep being friends with you.

 Great.

 But from now on, we have to be totally honest with each other.

 You're absolutely right.

 I'm not really a vegetarian.

 Have you ever tried horse meat? They eat it raw in Japan, and and FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY Shh!   


                





                    			 (cheering) D'oh! (tires screeching) (grunts) (clamoring) Okay.

 Next question.

 Yes.

 Will there be another Simpsons movie?   LISA: Our Lord, Buddha, says, "The secret of existence is to pass beyond fear.

" My brother is about to meet fear and as usual he won't pass.

 Wake up, Lis! It's the last day of school! (groans) Wake up, Maggs! It's the last day of school! (singsongy): Last day of school! (metal clanging rhythmically) Last day of school! Found my summer hobby! Banging pots together! Don't worry, Marge.

 As a favor to you, I'm enrolling that precious little jerk in this fresh air summer camp.

 That's a prison road crew.

 I did that last summer.

 I'm not allowed back.

 (humming) (whirring) Good-bye forever, multiplication! (slurps) Uh needs more numerators.

 Ah, "July 4th" What the? No fireworks?! Can't this stupid city entertain me one night a year?! The city's broke.

 The fire department has to raise money by delivering pizza.

 My baby! Back ribs! Marge, when you're broke, that's when you got to keep up appearances.

 The Fourth of July is the one day a year when our city puts on her high heels and tube top and leans into America's car window.

 (crying): God bless her.

 LISA: The last day of school.

 Field Day.

 When you learn to balance an egg on a spoon and run with your leg tied to someone who wouldn't talk to you all year.

 Hey! Are you coming to the after-school pool party? Not now.

 (giggles) Aw no fair! He actually has three legs.

 You lay off my son Tripod! He won fair and square, just like my twins Wheel and Barrow.

 Now, take you brother to the face painting.

 But don't make yourselves up to look all freaky.

 One, two, three, toss.

 (laughs) The eggs are supposed to be tossed between students, not at the principal.

 Once more and hurl! Aah! We will do this until we get it right.

 Look, do you want this to be your last school memory? (groans) Pull harder! What is wrong with you people?! Hey.

 I have thumbs, too.

 (chiming) (yells) I like the Play-Doh that comes out the back.

 See you next June, Macaroni.

 (door latch slides shut) And now the climactic Race around the School.

 Previous winners include Sideshow Mel, SeÃ±ora Bumblebee Man and Olympian Edwin Moses.

 I'll bet your biggest hurdle was leaving your beloved hometown.

 All hurdles are the same size.

 Man who is this loser? I've got a secret, Bart.

 That's good.

 Want to know what it is? No.

 My secret is I've been training for this race and no one suspects.

 Check it out: I'm wearing a dummy tummy.

 I'm gonna win and it'll change my life! Wow! Breaking that tape cured your asthma.

 (deep voice): Marvelous! Ha-ha-ha! (guffaws) (gasps) (lisping): Six on Bart Simpson.

 BOTH: Two on us to win.

 $20 on Milhouse.

 Milhouse?! (scoffs) That's a thousand-to-one odds.

 Perhaps I should take my action to Willie.

 (grunts) I ain't makin' book no more.

 I lost the deed to my shack! You are late with the rent, Willie.

 I'll have it by Friday, Mr.

 U.

 I swear.

 We can handle your action.

 (trumpet playing in the distance) Betting is now closed.

 (panting) And now, the 79th running of the Race around the School.

 Gun in the school! What the? Just, just go.

 And they're off! We've got a pack of fifth-graders on the rail, Simp-son holding down the center while Database and Cosine are still testing the wind speed.

 As the runners go into the first turn, Lewis is in the lead! Followed by Lovejoy's daughter, Fat Tony's nephew, Brockman's little girl (screams) and Jailbird's kid! The Frank Sinatra kid well, he's doing it his way! Rounding out the pack are all the kids that we never see.

 What's this? Milhouse takes the lead? The same boy who sprained his shoulder doing the Pledge of Allegiance? (panting) Uh-oh! If Milhouse wins this race, we're out a fortune.

 Don't worry.

 The race takes a turn through the trees where no one can see.

 When Milhouse gets there, you know what to do.

 Oh, yeah.

 Totally.

 I mean, it's so obvious.

 Just punch him! Exactly.

 Right in the nnn fff dee? There is no wrong answer! CHALMERS: And Milhouse, the boy nobody loves, is widening his lead! And what does he have to jump over? Nothing, that's what.

 I'm out of here.

 (grunting) Good job, Edwin.

 I'm doing it! I'm doing it! And when I win, I'm changing my name.

 To something cool like Winnie! Did you come to give me a cup of water? (both grunt) The best day of my life just turned into every other day of my life.

 LISA: Bart faced a terrible choice-- take a beating with his friend or slither off like a coward.

 And like he did with every multiple choice question he ever saw, Bart chose "B.

" (crowd cheering) The winner is Bart Simpson! LISA: Bart won a blue ribbon.

 But was it worth it? MARGE: Lisa! Bath time! LISA: Mom! I'm narrating! MARGE: The water's gonna get cold! LISA: Fine.

 []LISA: As the pin on the back of the blue ribbon made its way through Bart's shirt and into its housing, the seeds of his comeuppance flew out of the woods.

 Son! What happened to you in the dark place behind the school? Something good? I'm afraid I don't remember.

 Whew.

 Well, it looks like Milhouse has traumatic amnesia.

 He may never remember what happened to him.

 The most important thing is, the race results are now official.

 Now I've got to look at some severe cases of ice cream headache.

 (theme from MASH playing) (Bart groaning) (gasps) Help me, Bart! (screams) Help me, Bart! (shouts) (gasps) Help me, Bart! (gasping) Why am I having nightmares? I'm no coward.

 (screams) A chicken feather? Why would you hand this to me? Oh, you must've figured out I chickened out during the race.

 Well, who are you to judge me? I suck? You suck! LISA: While Bart was being outwitted by a baby, something was coming to a boil in our pop's brainpan.

 Marge, if this stupid, one-reactor town won't put on a fireworks show, I will.

 I've mapped it out.

 (laughs) Hmm? (groans) Maybe we should just light sparklers in the backyard.

 Eh, I've had my problems with sparklers.

 Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! (screams) LISA: But Fourth of July fireworks were a different story.

 They meant more to my dad than my Mom could ever know.

 It was the one night of every year that he couldn't hear his parents argue.

 He figured it was because they loved the fireworks just as much as he did.

 I want to take a class! Why can't you be happy ironing my shirts?! I need space! Then close your eyes and go to Hawaii! LISA: With his mom gone, Homer needed a hero, and no one was a bigger hero than the magical little man behind the controls.

 (fireworks whistling) Are you God? No, no.

 But I shoot rockets into his a-face.

 Here's-a my card.

 Don't forget to treasure it.

 Hmm.

 Now let's see.

 Which pants have that card? Board shorts, interested shorts.

 Here we are.

 Kaboom.

 Giuseppe, I want you to come out of retirement for the greatest fireworks show of your career.

 Why do you come here and remind me of a time in my life when I made a-tons of money doing a-what I love? If the Expendables movies have taught us anything, it's that people do their best work after they're old and forgotten.

 Well, I am younger than Sylvester Stallone.

 I will do it! Hey, buddy.

 Bart, my truest friend.

 I brought you a cake.

 Read it.

 That's an odd message.

 But who am I to argue with icing? Will you watch Cassidy the Crocodile with me? Um, that's kind of a baby show.

 It's all I can handle now.

 (sighs) Henrietta Kitten? Will you marry me? Meow, meow, maybe.

 Why would a kitten marry a crocodile? Wouldn't it eat her? (shushes) Suspension of disbelief.

 Friends help friends in trouble.

 No! Turn it off! It's too intense for me! Some guys just can't handle crocodiles.

 Is it over yet? (chicken clucks) And if you're dissatisfied for any reason, I will refund your money in the form of acorns.

 (groans) Hey, this gunpowder, it has a-crystal meth in it.

 Crystal meth? Then what the heck did I sell to them Colombian drug lords? Brandine! We're feuding with the Escobars again! Does that mean I ain't talking to Maria? Duh! Yes.

 Homer, we will get the fireworks someplace else.

 The pig's been eating the C-4 blocks again! (burps) (dog barks) We've invited a new athlete to join our do-gooding dream team.

 Please welcome fleet-footed phenom, Bart Simpson.

 (crowd cheering) Hey, everyone.

 I sure got a lot of attention for winning this year's Race around the School.

 (crowd cheering) Completely deserved! Yeah, yeah.

 Thank you, Mel.

 But I am not here to talk about myself.

 Milhouse, would you join me at the podium? (clamoring) What's going on? Seriously, what-what's transpiring? I've got to set things straight.

 During that same race, my friend Milhouse was in the lead, when something horrible happened! LISA: Bart knew the worst thing to do was pile lie upon lie.

 And that's exactly what he did.

 Rather than try to figure out what happened, Milhouse had the courage to move on.

 To me, that's a hero.

 (crowd cheering) Nicely done.

 Now we will give out free rubber bracelets.

 Do not wear them to bed.

 They smell like truck tires.

 They're disgusting.

 Crotch or forehead? Uh, forehead for once.

 Wha? Bart Simpson! You ran away when I was getting beat up! (crowd booing) Bart's a coward! He lied to us! Stop the tattoo! Uh, I could make it a bag of groceries.

 All right, make sure there's some French bread sticking out.

 Ow.

 Ow.

 Ow.

 Ow! [](crowd rabbling) Look how he runs now! LISA: So Bart was revealed as a coward.

 And now it seemed like the whole world was against him.

 (screams) (panting) MALE ANNOUNCER: Have you ever considered a reverse-equity mortgage? That's what put me in this dump! Grampa, everyone's calling me a coward.

 Well, join the club.

 Anyone who makes it to old age has got to be part-coward.

 Come on, you were in World War II.

 Do you know how I survived D-Day? (retches) Don't worry-- just a day at the beach.

 I'll be back around 1946! But don't people hate cowards? Sure do.

 But we outlive the brave.

 Leaving us cowards to make time with the heroes' widows.

 After Korea, I was drowning in boobies.

 Wow, that sounds pretty sweet.

 Well, there is a price.

 Do you wake up sweating in the middle of the night? Yes.

 So do I.

 But I get back to sleep by counting the men I let down.

 There's Jerry, Izzy, Brooklyn, the O'Donnell boys, the lost ship PT-108, the Poor Buggers of Meatloaf Ridge, the Andrew sisters (snoring) (gasps) I understand.

 You have standards.

 (gasps) This is an angry sleepover.

 I'm only doing it 'cause it was on the books.

 LISA While Bart was in hell, Homer was happily surrounded by fire and brimstone.

 Okay, let's make some fireworks.

 Now drive slowly and a-carefully to my workshop.

 It's in-a the Cobblestone a-District.

 Oh, thank God-- a rickety bridge.

 Don't worry.

 We'll be safe in the Gas a-Lamp a-District.

 (tires screeching) ("Stars and Stripes Forever" playing) Can I pitch something? Go ahead.

 Boom! Biddy bom-bom boom! Biddy bom bow! Ba-dip-boo! Boom! Boom! That's-a nice.

 (laughs)  Sometimes when we touch   The honesty's too much  Wrong holiday, Charlie Brown.

 (overlapping chatter) Yoink.

 Ha-haw! We're on it, ma'am! Okay, coarse gunpowder, get the ball in there, don't forget the wadding, tamp, tamp, tamp, fine gunpowder in the pan, firing stance, take careful aim and (grunts) Uh, yeah, not enough tamping, Chief.

 Coarse gunpowder, ball, wadding, tamp, tamp, tamp, tamp, tamp, tamp, fine gunpowder in the pan.

 Come on Aw, my boy's having a bad night.

 We should get this show on the road.

 No, the time is not yet right.

 When they look at their watches and mutter, "Hey, when are these a-jerks going to a-start?" That's when they're ready to be enchanted.

 Come on, let's go! I can't stand to see my family unhappy on America's holiest day.

 Actually, July 2 is when congress declared independence, the date that-a should be celebrated.

 Hey, Super Mario.

 Don't you tell me about America! Idiot! I'm-a right! No, you're a-wrong! "July 2"-- I am quoting John Adams! Who the hell is that? (both grunt) (all screaming) Oh, dear.

 The term "target audience" is taking on a sinister connotation.

 Milhouse, this is my chance to make things right.

 What are you up to now? Get on that bus! I'll explain during the explosions! Don't a-panic! We'll be okay as long as the sequence doesn't a-start.

 Hit Bart's dad in the butt! Roger that.

 Did you factor in the wind? No.

  Sometimes when we touch.

   The honesty's too much  Don't worry, boys! I'll be with you all the way to Berlin.

 (cackles) (all clamoring) (coughing) So, who is our hero? I hope it's Carl.

 Nah, no such luck.

 I was just Tweeting a picture of what I thought was my last meal.

 Hot dog and French fries! (all gasping) Milhouse is our unlikely savior! MAN: Quit explaining everything, let him talk.

 Well, it wasn't me.

 It was Bart who Saw everything you did.

 Milhouse is the hero.

 Take it from me, the boy who's lied throughout.

 ALL: Milhouse! Milhouse! Oh, I get it now.

 Thanks, Bart.

 LISA: So Milhouse got the redemption he deserved, and so, in a way, did Bart.

 ALL: Coward! Coward! Coward! LISA: Which meant that, at long last, my brother could get a good night's sleep.

 (slow melody playing on piano) Oh, enough doom and gloom! (playing upbeat melody) []Look, Maggie, I undid my deed.

 So I'm just gonna take your feather and say good night.

 Oh, where are these coming from? Oh, I see.

 That's all you wanted.

 How's that, kiddo? (clucking) and FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY HOMER:  Sometimes when we touch  GIUSEPPE:  The honesty, she's-a too much  BOTH:  And I have to close my eyes and hide  GIUSEPPE:  I wanna hold you till I die  HOMER (laughing): One more year, tops.

 GIUSEPPE: I live-a longer than you.

 HOMER: Then, burn on you 'cause you'll be holding onto a dead guy.

 (laughs) GIUSEPPE:  I wanna hold you   A-till the fear in me subsides  HOMER: Believe me, if you're holding onto a 300-pound dead guy, fear is not gonna be your problem.

 GIUSEPPE: Congratulations, you have ruined a beautiful song.

 HOMER: It's a song? I thought we were just riffing.

 GIUSEPPE: I apologize to Dan Hill and all of our viewers.

 Hey, Dad.

 We made popcorn.

 HOMER: Woo-hoo! Huh? Out of my reach? (grunts) Must make effort.

 (grunting) (bones crack) Yay.

 Mr.

 Simpson, you earned this.

 (quiet grunts) What's on TV? Krusty's getting roasted tonight.

 Hey.

 (grumbles) Sometimes the language on these gets a little B-L-U-E.

 What? Oh.

 If you don't let us watch, we'll just go to a house where some more permissive parents will.

 How permissive? Chief Wiggum shows us crime photos at sleepovers.

 So this is what a body looks like after it drops Uh, come on, Milhouse, don't pretend you're asleep.

 This is the world we live in.

 Yeah.

 (crowd laughs over TV) Hey, Krusty, our local deli just named a sandwich after you.

 It's called "The Unfunny Comedian.

" (crowd laughs) You will always be remembered for your countless appearances on the Krusty the Clown Show and your one appearance on To Catch A Predator.

 (crowd laughs) Hey, I spent a lifetime making people happy.

 Yeah-- plastic surgeons and divorce lawyers.

 I was just about to say that.

 Oh, he took my laugh.

 Screw it, I'm doing it anyway.

 Plastic surgeons and divorce lawyers.

 (man coughs) What a legend.

 Krusty the Clown is to comedy what Martin Luther King is to comedy.

 (laughter) We've seen a lot of top-flight comics tonight, but that's over, because it's time to hear from Krusty the Clown.

 Welcome, Krusty.

 I grew up watching you.

 Oh, uh, sorry.

 I threw up watching you.

 (laughter, applause) (grumbles) Sarah Silverman.

 I say this with love, you disrespectful skank.

 You've had more Oh.

 Suddenly, I don't feel like doing this.

 (gasps) Sorry, Mini-ha-ha.

 Canceling the bit.

 Tell the others.

 I thought this night would be fun for me and my friends.

 I don't even know these people.

 And I guess I don't have any friends.

 My only comfort is the roast is over and will only be shown four times a day for the rest of all time.

 Krusty.

 Yeah? Is your nose red because it's embarrassed to be seen with you? (laughter) Oh, nobody warned me this roast would treat me the same way as every roast I've seen and laughed at.

 and the husband says, "Who paid you a nickel?" And the wife says, "Everybody.

" (laughs) Oh, sorry, wrong for this audience.

 I thought Swapper Jack's was something else.

 Krusty, sorry about the roast.

 They had no right to say those hilarious things.

 How could they say I'm past my prime? Me-- the voice of Ovaltine.

 Krusty, why don't you talk to your dad? He'll cheer you up.

 He's a rabbi.

 He must've learned something from that giant star scroll he's always reading.

 Kid, does talking to your dad make you feel better? Well, no, but he's not a rabbi.

 More of a flabbi.

 (snorts, laughs) Why, you little I'll show you who's a flabbi! (grunting) (muffled): No, you're not a flabbi! Yeah, all muscle.

 In Minnesota, I'd be a supermodel.

 Okay, I got it.

 So, basically, I came here so you could tell me the truth-- that I'm great.

 As the Torah says: Judgment belongs to God.

 The Torah also says you can't eat ham, and I'm the spokesman for HamCo Ham.

 This is why I only call you on Christmas and Easter.

 Wait, wait, wait.

 Please, Dad.

 Do you even think I'm funny? I'm not gonna lie to you, for funny, I prefer Rabbi Rudenstein.

 He puts the "ha" in Hanukah and the "levity" in Leviticus.

 As for you, son, if you want to know my honest opinion of you, you've always been eh.

 Go on.

 I've always been "Eh ntertaining"? Dad? Show me nose fog.

 Oh, God, he's dead.

 And he never lived to see me be successful.

 So maybe the best way to say how I feel about my dad is through a song that someone else wrote that I hired people to sing.

 This is for you, Dad.

 (to the Itchy &amp; Scratchy theme):  He fought and fought   And fought for Jewish rights   Wisdom sought   Students taught   Rabbi Krustofsky's gone.

  Yeah, well, it's just well, I thought Seriously, it can be really tough to lose your father.

 (crying) RUDENSTEIN: Yasher Co-ack.

 Let us all please rise.

 (snoring) Homer, get up.

 Huh? Oh, uh (grunting) Oh! Oh! Ooh! (panting) Dad, are you okay? Yeah, yeah, great.

 (sighs) I guess my getting-up days are over.

 (gasps) (humming a tune) Dad, you're eating too much.

 I'm worried about your health.

 I don't want to lose you.

 (softly): Oh, no.

 Krusty, I brought some homemade chicken soup.

 We used the Play-Doh maker for the matzo.

 Uh, thanks, but I don't really like soup.

 But you wear that little spoon around your neck.

 (chuckles) You really notice stuff, don't you? Yes.

 And I can tell how hard it was to lose your father.

 But at least you were there to share his final thoughts.

 Eh.

 No, no, it's a big thing.

 No, that's what he called me.

 "Eh.

" Mm.

 It could be worse.

 Oh, yeah? How? I don't know, uh how about (blows raspberry) That's a lot worse.

 Can you stop comforting me now? Krusty, condolences on your loss.

 So this is the Bob whose comedic genius I can never live up to.

 Believe me, all of us have thought about killing him.

 (sighs) Clowns have it tough, Krusty.

 I understand.

 I was Professor Pickles with Ringling Brothers for several years.

 The elephant and I had our differences.

 So, what brings you here? And don't say clown car.

 I'm a sad, tragic clown.

 Like what's his name-- Liberace.

 Tell me about your father, huh? Ah! Herschel, did you read your Exodus? Oh, uh, oh, sure.

 Really? Then tell me, what did the burning bush say? It said "Ow! Put me out! How many talking bushes do you think there are?!" (laughs) My son, you are a big needy nothing that only laughs can fill.

 (scoffs) I don't need laughs.

 Ha.

 Oh, thank you.

 Thank you.

 A big needy nothing.

 (sniffles) Wow.

 Wow.

 Krusty, would you like a therapy dog? Yeah.

 With extra relish! Hey-hey! I still got it, huh? Yes, if by "it" you mean reflexive denial of your inner sadness.

 (sadly): Hey-hey.

 SIDESHOW MEL: Shut up, children.

 Boys and girls, you know that we've been dark for a couple of days because of a tragic loss in the Krustylu family.

 Now put your hands together for the man who's falling apart before our eyes, Krusty the Clown! (kids cheering) (jaunty theme music plays) No monologue.

 Roll the cartoon.

 (swing creaking) Oh, my God! Who made this monstrosity? I did everything! Kids, I'm experiencing a crisis of conscience.

 (canned applause) No, no, no, no! I don't deserve the prerecorded applause of children long gone.

 (canned applause) KID: I like Ike! Therefore, I'm quitting the show.

 And I know Mel will be quitting it with me.

 Yes, yes, buy the house.

 It'll be Uh, what?! Today is the day the pity laughter died.

 Krusty the Clown has retired.

 For a brief overview of a half-century of ha-has, here is Channel Six TV critic Clive Meriwether.

 Krusty the Clown will perhaps best be remembered for taking up two spots in the Channel Six parking lot.

 On a personal level, he used to call me Little Lord Tingaling.

 I shan't miss that.

 This man's only lasting legacies are a law in his name limiting the working hours of chimpanzees to 14 hours a day and the invention of the payment of alimony by dropping hot pennies from a helicopter.

 I give his life a D-plus.

 Good day to you.

 What will Krusty do now? I suppose only time will tell.

 Which is true for all news stories, I guess.

 Until anyone realizes, I'm Kent Brockman adding no useful information.

 And here's another sentence.

 You can tell I'm winding it up because my voice is going up and down like this.

 Well, at least now I have plenty of time to solve this Rubik's Cube.

 All right, what if I did Oh! (Homer snoring unevenly) (snoring, gasping) (quietly): Mom, Dad.

 Yes, Lisa? (snores) What? I've been listening, and Dad stops breathing for as long as five minutes.

 Mind if I sleep with you guys and keep an eye on him? Sweetie, you shouldn't have to worry about such things.

 (gasps, snores, wheezing) The doctor gave us this machine to help him breathe in his sleep.

 Go to bed.

 I'll take care of him.

 No good.

 No good.

 (grunting) Oh! Ooh! Ah! (gasping) What do I do? What do I do? Oh.

 Breathe, Homie, breathe.

 (grunting) Well, at least Teeny's doing okay.

 He's in The Odd Couple with David Hyde Pierce.

 Now, really, Oscar, would it kill you to use a coaster? (screeching) If you're going to go up there, at least dust! Finally, done the way I first imagined it.

 I'm gonna prove you did groundbreaking work.

 Krusty, I want you to binge-watch all the shows you've ever done.

 Well, I've never said no to a binge.

 (static crackles) Deuteronomy? Isn't that the study of deuters? Hippocampus? Isn't that another name for the University of Mississippi? Okay.

 I've been on 50 years.

 You're bound to repeat yourself a little.

 Unless I wanted to be sat on by Mama Cass.

 Unless I wanted to be sat on by Dom DeLuise.

 by the cast of What's Happening! William "The Refrigerator" Perry, everyone! Newman from Seinfeld.

 the whale from Whale Rider.

 Adele! (laughs) What? She's a guest star?! (sobbing) (groans) (static hissing) So that's why all my cameramen have PTSD.

 Where's my whiskey funnel?! (German accent): Young man, you should go.

 When the master is like this, it is no place for children.

 Pour, Helga! It begins.

 (gulping) (angelic choir singing) Whoa.

 Where am I? Why, you're in Jewish Heaven.

 Oh, this place is great.

 Why, my necktie straightens itself.

 Even Portnoy has no complaints.

 And I tell you, I get so much respect.

 Wow.

 So I made it to Heaven.

 (klezmer playing) (crowd cheering) This place is amazing! Schmuck, there's no Jewish Heaven.

 Our faith teaches us that once you're dead, that's it, kaput.

 It's dark, it's cold.

 It's like that apartment we lived in before I started doing weddings.

 But you, my son, remain Eh?! (groans) Go back to Earth.

 Do something with your life.

 Help people.

 (echoing): Help people.

 Help people.

 Help people.

 Nothing.

 I'm not getting a pulse.

 (gasps) I got to change my life! Still no pulse.

 I guess I'm just really bad at this.

 WOMAN:  Someone to watch   Over me.

  I'm afraid Lisa's getting obsessed with keeping her father out of danger.

 She's gotten our Resusci Annie doll to breathe on its own.

 (wheezes) Why? In this new shelter, we provide a home for animals put out of work by Cirque Du Soleil.

 (gorilla growls) Um, Krusty, have you fulfilled the promise you made to your father in the dream you never told anyone about? Uh, no.

 Somehow a brief act of uncharacteristic generosity solved nothing.

 Hey, Krusty.

 What? Have you been going to temple? Yeah, and I've learned that all religions are equally boring.

 But there's a reason I went.

 Come and see.

 Kid, there's no way you can cheer me up.

 Not when whiskey, good deeds and hookers failed.

 Who's a hooker? Uh, with me, it's easier to say which ones aren't hookers.

 Hmm? (grunting) Lisa, what are you doing? Wrapping you in bubble wrap.

 I can't always be around to protect you, so it will.

 But (bubble wrap popping) Oh, Lisa, honey, you can't insulate yourself from life.

 Why, I could live till 100 or a bus could hit me tomorrow.

 That's why I never plan more than four seconds ahead.

 Oh, I guess you're right.

 Now come on.

 Give Daddy a hug.

 (grunting, bubble wrap popping) Bubble wrap! (bubble wrap popping) Your daughterly love saved me, sweetie.

 That's all I wanted, a tiny bit of control.

 Ooh.

 I suppose we should exchange insurance information.

 I don't have any.

 Me neither.

 Then we have the same company.

 They'll work it all out.

 (tires screeching) (quietly): Rabbi Rudenstein.

 Your father's favorite.

 Today's reading is from Deuteronomy, which I believe is the study of deuters.

 (laughter) Hey, that's my joke.

 Eh, must be a coincidence.

 Uh, but before we begin, I'd like to quote the burning bush, which said, "Hey, put me out.

 How many talking bushes do you think there are?" Hey-hey.

 (laughter) Me again.

 So if Dad loved his jokes, then Dad loved my jokes.

 (crying): Oh Yeah, I guess he just hated your delivery.

 He loved my jokes.

 My father respected me but could never tell me.

 That's Jewish Heaven.

  Heaven   Jewish Heaven  RABBI KRUSTOFSKY:  We're a father and a son who didn't speak   But up here we found the happiness we seek   And I can't wait till you join me next week  You! (music continues) Uh, just this once, you think you could turn water into a Bloody Mary? I'll tell you, you're all right, you know? Krusty, let's face it, you might not be cutting-edge anymore, but your show still does really great in that key demo of people who died with the TV on.

 (laughter) Whoa.

 Of course, Krusty's responsible for Itchy &amp; Scratchy, which is also what he calls his testicles.

 (groans) D'oh.

 Shh!   


                





                    			 D'oh! (tires screeching) (grunts) (screams) (door slams) (laughs) (whistle blows, crowd cheers on TV) (retches, groans) (laughs) (groaning, grunting) (Bart laughs) Well, it wasn't easy, but we managed to watch every "testicle fail" video on the Internet.

 Now to leave a great comment.

 LOL.

 That's gotta hurt.

 Oh I guess there's nothing left to do but go outside and play.

 Wait-- a sponsored link.

 MILHOUSE: Ooh! A trailer for Project: After Party.

 The long-awaited sequel to Project: Party.

 (gasps) That's a red band trailer.

 We're not old enough to see that.

 Sure we are.

 I just have to enter my birthday.

 January 1, 1900.

 No movie's so dirty the oldest man in the world can't see it.

 Well, they did everything they could to stop us, but we hacked through anyway.

 NARRATOR: They thought the party was over.

 After party!   (gasps) (gasps) Brief nudity! I thought we installed parental blocking software on all our computers.

 I don't know what that stuff blocks.

 Mammogram appointment.

 (alarm blares) I told you to clean your room and instead you're watching chest videos.

 Look at all those bowls of half-eaten cereal.

 The cereal on the bottom gets soggy.

 I know how cereal works.

 Now clean your room.

 Why should I? It's just gonna get dirty again.

 I'm in charge.

 You do what I say.

 I'll get to it when I get to it.

 That better not mean what it means when I say it.

 (squishing) D'oh! That boy has no respect for my authority.

 Maybe you two are more similar than you'd like to admit.

 We're not similar.

 I love being told what to do by someone who's wise in the ways of the world.

 Love it! Here's what I would do: in the middle of the night, clean Bart's room for him, then, in the morning, thank him for cleaning his room.

 You poor woman.

 Dealing with Bart has turned your mind to ketchup water.

 You rest.

 I'll be the boy's father now.

 I'm done.

 I'd like it if you ate a little more broccoli.

 Eh, I'm not feelin' it.

 Your mother said eat your broccoli.

 Why do I need to eat broccoli? So that you can grow up healthy and strong, like Randy Quaid.

 Yeah, Randy Quaid.

 He's very healthy.

 Look, I'll drink another glass of milk.

 (scoffs) Milk.

 That's for babies and old guys who can't sleep at night because of what they did in the war.

 Broccoli.

 Hey, what if I eat the broccoli? I love the stuff.

 (chuckles) You eat a sundae.

 Marge, get Lisa a sundae.

 You are not leaving this table until you eat that broccoli.

 And I'm going to sit right here until you do.

 (scoffs) You'll never out-sit me.

 Oh, really? You think your skinny butt can sit on that hard, wooden chair longer than El Gordo? (gasps) The sit is on.

 Eat your broccoli.

 No.

 Eat your broccoli.

 No.

 (snoring) (alarm rings) Read your broccoli.

 No.

 They've been at it all night.

 I know, but they're not gonna waste a whole Saturday inside.

 (phone rings) Mm-hmm? Homer, where are you? Our fantasy football draft is about to start.

 (gasps) Today's our draft.

 I've got to pick a good fantasy team.

 When I lost last year, they made me do something so humiliating Jeebus loves Tebow.

 (Homer whimpers) And so the fat man caves.

 If you need me, I'll be up in my room eating cereal.

 Half a bowl of cereal.

 Marge, I want you-- my wife-- to draft my fantasy football team.

 (all gasp) I-I don't really know that much about the My team name is "Somewhere Over the Dwayne Bowe" and my password is "Annoyed Grunt.

" Draft with God, honey.

 Eat your broccoli.

 (panting) Martin's been secretly taking self-defense courses, and now he's beating up Nelson.

 MARTIN: Hi-yah! NELSON: Ow.

 Ow.

 Whoa.

 Aah! His fat fists are a blur.

 I've never seen moves like that.

 KEARNEY: And never will again.

 Sounds like quite a match.

 And here's your ticket to a front-row seat.

 No.

 No.

 I'll never eat those filthy mini-trees.

 Today, I wear the vest.

 Haw.

 Haw.

 (groans) Now I am never eating that broccoli.

 Homie.

 Homie, the fantasy draft just ended.

 I got you five kickers.

 It is called football, right? You are definitely eating that broccoli.

 (Homer and Bart growling) This has got to stop.

 If you don't go to work, you're going to get fired.

 I can get another job.

 Who wouldn't want to hire a man who won't back down? I could be a prison warden or a Southern anything.

 I've got an idea, but I'll need that broccoli.

 (blender whirrs) These two fruit smoothies look and taste exactly the same.

 One of them, however, has the broccoli blended in.

 Bart picks one of the smoothies and drinks it-- maybe he had the broccoli, maybe he didn't.

 No one knows, so neither of you has given in, and this horrible impasse can come to an end.

 Uh, works for me.

 I'm in.

 Oh, thank God.

 Hmm Oh, no, the broccoli.

 (annoyed grunt) You did that on purpose! You lick this table clean! Come on.

 Lick it.

 (grunting) (both grunting, groaning) (both grunting) Come on, now, you can still lick it.

 Oh, I'm afraid Homer and Bart's problems are beyond our power to solve.

 There's only one thing left to try.

 (snoring) (snoring) (both grunt) (all grunt) (whispers): And, lift.

 Put my sack back on.

 I'm trying to sleep.

 (both snoring) (grunts) Hmm? (gasps) (gasps) Where are we? I don't know.

 Eat your broccoli.

 No.

 We're on an old-time boat.

 We've been kidnapped.

 (chuckles): Not kidnapped, shanghaied.

 Oh.

 Oh.

 My name is Captain Bowditch.

 Your wife signed you up for a week at sea, where you'll live like sailors, eat like sailors and use therapeutic techniques to solve father-son conflicts like sailors.

 Hmm? Hmm? For there's no better place to solve relationship issues than on The Relation Ship.

 "Relation Ship.

" It works two ways.

 (laughs) Pretty good.

 (laughs) Pretty good.

 Hey, lame ass, Thanks to you, we're stuck on a stupid therapy boat.

 I'm the lame ass? The only lame ass on this boat is you and all the other lame asses! (both grunting, groaning) Shouldn't we do something? We are doing something.

 We're empathizing.

 I just know Bart and Homer are best friends already.

 I can feel it.

 (computer dings) Ooh, I'm getting a message from your father's fantasy football league.

 I must still be logged in as him.

 Lenny used the "uck" word.

 Mom, it's trash talk.

 You know how guys say mean things to their friends, the way women say nice things to their enemies.

 Oh.

 (computer dings) Yikes! Well I don't like this trash talk.

 And I'm gonna do something about it.

 Even if I have to bring in the big guns.

 Dear Lord, please help Homer's friends understand that make-believe computer football is no excuse for using the Internet to be mean.

 (phone buzzes) (gasps) Trash talk? In church? No.

 No, not here.

 (phones buzzing) MARGE (gasps): It's everywhere.

 And now, a moment of silence for the victims of the Shelbyville sinkhole.

 (phone buzzes) (Marge gasps) The WI-Fi.

 The WI-Fi.

 I've got to take out The WI-Fi.

 She's under a lot of stress.

 Her husband's at sea.

 (bell dinging) Ahoy, lads and dads.

 It's never easy to talk about your feelings in front of strangers so we're going to sing about them.

  Who wants to sing about their feelings   Who wants to go first and sing about their feelings   I'll go first and sing about my feelings   I'm so happy to be singing.

  Now, Homer.

 D'oh! So, Cletus, Gitmo, what brings you fellas to The Relation Ship? My daddy's always overpraisin' me.

 Aw, that's great honesty, son.

 I'm so proud of you.

 (scoffs) Why won't you let me fail? What about you, Bart, Homer? Homer? Lethargy, skin spots, spongy gums-- this man's got scurvy.

 But we've only been at sea one day.

 When's the last time you had citrus? I had a mimosa at brunch a few years ago.

 Well, Bart, while your father spends the next few days sucking out of the lemon barrel, you'll drink deep of the hearty grog of empowerment.

 What does that mean? Mainly climbing.

 Except for Wednesday night when we project a movie on the sails.

 But, really, a lot of climbing.

 (Gilbert and Sullivan's "We Sail the Ocean Blue" playing) Sheepshank, bowline, clove hitch (Homer sucking) Dad, look, I did a round turn with two half hitches.

 You lie! (gasps) Wait a minute.

 Windswept hair, rugged tan, rough, calloused hands.

 You're enjoying this, aren't you?! So what if I am? You're my son and you will hate what I hate.

 Angled parking.

 Lemons.

 Kickstarters by famous guys who already have lots of money.

 And this boat! I'm old enough to choose my own things to hate.

 And the things I like.

 And I like being a sailor.

 Betrayed by my worst enemy.

 I never would have seen it coming.

 Why, Bart, that's a perfect halyard cleat.

 Just like you taught me, Captain.

 Over, under, over, under, over, under, under, under, over, over, over, over, over, over, over, under, over, half hitch.

 Well, the standard form is under, over, under, over, under, under, under, under, under, over, over, under, under, under, under, around, over, over, under Fathers, sons, together we've made a lot of progress on this voyage.

 I learned that left is called "port.

" I finally got over my sea sickness.

 (retches) Terrific, Homer.

 Just terrific.

 But one sailor has truly taken to nautical life.

 I hereby award Bart Simpson the post of midshipman.

 (spits) Wow.

 So now I can give orders? That's right, Mr.

 Midshipman.

 Wait a minute.

 I'm his father.

 He can't order me around.

 He's your superior officer, so he can and will order you around.

 And what if I refuse? Oh! I'm sorry we had to discipline you.

 On the positive side, you won't miss out on the father/son hornpipe dance.

 (playing accordion) Oh, I hate the Golden Age of Sail.

 (whistles) Officer on deck! Seaman Homer, you're supposed to be swabbing the deck.

 Why should I? It's just gonna get dirty again.

 I'm in charge.

 You do what I say.

 Fine.

 I'll swab whatever you say.

 Look! I'm swabbing the deck.

 I'm swabbing this giant tree that the sail grows out of.

 Ooh! I'm swabbing the top of the ocean.

 Ooh! Swab, swab, swab Hey! What the? Fantasy football has turned every man in this town into a trash-talking monster.

 Oh, face it-- all men live in a sad world of profanity, boob jokes and tired comedy references.

 MÃ¡s cowbell! (laughter) There's only one thing that will shut these guys up.

 You got to beat one of them at fantasy football.

 (dramatic, epic sports theme music playing) Then that's what I'm gonna do.

 NARRATOR: Game day.

 As an icy mist rose from a package of defrosting hamburger meat, desktop gladiator Marge Simpson prepared to lead her husband's team against undefeated trash-talker Moe Szyslak.

 Mom did everything: she checked injury lists, scouting reports, she even studied the tapes.

 The tapes of The Real Housewives of Tampa Bay, where she watched star running back Lakwando Demarius get kicked out of his house after buying his wife the wrong color convertible.

 That doesn't match my phone! Lakwando's mind won't be on the game.

 And benched.

 And now to make my big move.

 Homer's team e-mailed asking to start five kickers.

 I was like, "Okay, it's, uh, your funeral.

" There would be no funeral.

 High winds, unlocked by the savage power of climate change, allowed Marge's five kickers to launch a long-range campaign of three-point annihilation.

 An 85-yard field goal? You got to be kidding me! Refresh, refresh.

 But no amount of refreshing could alter the facts: Despite a breathtaking ignorance and a powerful dislike of the sport, a rookie housewife had defeated a savvy veteran, proving conclusively that fantasy football is basically just luck.

 Ahoy, Midshipman.

 I hope your voyage on The Relation Ship is proving interpersonally fruitful.

 I don't know.

 It's really hard when someone doesn't respect your authority.

 Epiphany ho.

 And I'm sure your father has been doing some growing and learning of his own.

  I found some booze in another dad's bag   Drunk, drunk   Drunk on a boat  Yi-yo-yu! (grunts) You don't need booze, Homer.

 I went to sea because I'm a recovering alcoholic.

 But out here on the waves, I no longer crave the sweet, warm, soothing flavors of yummy, yummy rummy.

 (gulping) I love this boat! With all its pullies and flappies and Everything has a name.

 You know what, Homer? I've always wanted to eat a parrot.

 What's the big deal? It's just like a green chicken! Yeah NARRATOR: But fortune did not favor The Relation Ship, as the same winds that lofted Marge's fantasy field goals to victory now sent gales of doom toward this vessel of questionable therapeutic value.

 (thunder rumbling) White lightnin' squall! Why is the captain just juggling? Okay, o-okay.

 I can do this.

 I can do this.

 Someone count me in! I said count me in! Don't worry, I'll radio the Coast Guard for help.

 The therapy bears! Look out for the therapy bears! Oh! I'm a-comin', bears! Don't stand there gawking like a dang fool! Do somethin', boy! You criticized me! That's all I ever wanted, Daddy, honest parenting.

 CLETUS: Aw Now I'm the ship's highest-ranking officer.

 It's up to me to get us to shore.

 Dad, we can make it to harbor if we can just sail around that lighthouse.

 Are you crazy? We'll never make it! Drop the anchor and wait out the storm! No, we need to sail.

 I'm dropping the anchor! Can't you just do what I say? You've never done what I say-- ever! (booming, crashing) (gasps) (gulps, groans) (gasps) Now can we please respect each other? (booming, crashing) Yes, son.

 We can.

 Awaiting your orders, Mr.

 Midshipman! Put up the storm jib and haul in the main sheet! Aye aye, sir.

 Another success story for The Relation Ship.

 (glugging) (humming happily) (humming happily) So, did your sailing adventure help you work out your issues? Does this answer your question? (sailor's hornpipe music plays) Yar! Quite a hornpipe Thar be.

 But, uh, surely you would never have gone on a sea adventure without your old friend, the Sea Captain.

 Yar.

 That's gonna hurt for a long time.

 Yar.

 (Gilbert and Sullivan's "We Sail the Ocean Blue" playing)   


                





                    			  Tea for the tillerman   Steak for the son   Wine for the woman who made the rain come   Seagulls sing your hearts away   'Cause while the sinners sin   The children play   Oh, Lord, how they play and play   For that happy day   For that happy day   Happy day.

  D'oh! (humming a tune) You're never bored paintin' the Lord.

 Daddy, could you help us with our school project? We're huntin' vampire appliances! Say no more.

 Mm-hmm.

 Okay.

 (grunting) Diddily, diddily (grunts) Well, we pulled more plugs than a Dutch doctor.

 Now let's take a trip to the side of the house.

 BOTH: Yay! (gasps) Why, that's a higher power than even I believe in.

 What is going on? My room, kids' room, knick-knack nook, Beatles Bunker, Left-hand Lounge What's this? (carnival music plays) (whooping) Huh? (music stops) Hey, I was listening to that.

 Homer Simpson.

 Got any other sockets in my pockets? Absolutely not.

 Really? Really? Really?! (groans) My one weakness-- the third "really.

" Come with me.

 (Homer grumbles, sighs) Turn right here.

 I keep this frozen meat in case society collapses but we still have power.

 Homer! This is my freezerino.

 Seriously, I am getting so tired of those stupid Flandersisms.

 It's the name of the freezer! HOMER: Okily Dokahama? FLANDER: Right next to Mount Fu-Gee, I'm glad to see ya! HOMER: Aw.

 It's all gonna thaw! Don't you give up on me! I'll cook this meat, cut it up and make it into sandwiches.

 And I will wait and worry!   (no voice) So, I cooked the meat, sliced it up, made sandwiches, cut off the crust, fed those to the dog Aw, somebody wants more crust.

 Here you go, boy! Here you go.

 Have some more.

 Still hungry, buddy? Dad, dogs don't know when to stop eating.

 Lucky.

 Ta-DA! ALL: Whoa! Oh, Marge, once again you've taken one of my screwups and turned it into food.

 Man, if only you could do that with Bart.

 Mom! Dad's imagining me as food again! He does it to all of us.

 Can someone put butter on me? HOMER: Family-icious.

 Come on, where's that butter? Hey, Mom, can you pack me a dozen sandwiches in my lunch tomorrow? Meat, no meat, it's all good.

 Sandwiches, Mom.

 Fill 'er up.

 And the garment bag.

 What's going on? Are you kids eating your feelings? No, whenever anything bothers me, I harmlessly vent it to Maggie.

 I smash fluorescent lights at the gravel pit.

 But that's so many sandwiches.

 Kids love them.

 We trade them at school.

 They replaced cigarettes as our currency.

 Bubble gum cigarettes? Yeah, sure.

 (doorbell rings) What are you doing here, freezer stealer? Ned's letting us use his freezer to store the extra sandwiches.

 Well, I felt a little guilty for taking back what belonged to me.

 (whoops) Flanders isn't perfect! (chuckling): Never claimed to be.

 Yeah, and aren't.

 Marge, see this face? It's opportunity.

 Blink, and you'll miss it.

 Huh? Just kidding.

 I'm right behind you.

 I'm Trudy Zengler, vice president of development for Mother Hubbard's Sandwich Cupboards.

 How would you like to run your own business? Take control of your financial future.

 Hmm.

 Homie, how much money do we have put aside in case something happens to you? None.

 (groans) If that flashback you just described is true, you can't afford not to open this franchise.

 I'm in.

 Wow, Mom! You're gonna open a sandwich store? Uh-huh.

 Mom, if you're gonna do this, there's one thing I need to know.

 And be honest.

 What's your soda refill policy? All you can drink, if you buy a jumbo cup.

 Careful, Marge, that's how I bankrupted a Pizza Hut.

 Mmm that's good.

 More, more.

 Refill Free! I-I just I Where is it going? My store.

 My offset spatula.

 Mine! (door opens, bell rings) Well, well, well.

 Seems like someone forgot there's a Krusty Burger two blocks away.

 Go ahead, Teeny.

 Show 'em what we did to Arby's.

 She did the one thing I never could-- feed him.

 You're a cool customer, Marge.

 And we've got your back.

 With everything from pre-sliced tomatoes, to the homey needlepoint on the walls.

 Aw And now, the best part of running your own franchise-- picking your Sammy Fammy.

 You'll want to avoid that.

 Your monkey just ate all my turkey.

 You want some monkey meat to replace it? No.

 It's low-fat.

 GIL: As you can see, I was just two credits short at Southern Illinois, and I got to be honest with you, Marge.

 I need this job bad.

 Hmm You seem to have had, and lost, a lot of jobs.

 It's a whole new world, Marge.

 A whole new world.

 Why, my dad spent his whole life at one company.

 Started in the basement mailroom, and ended his career jumping out the window from the top floor.

 (groans) Yeah, he was wearing this suit.

 Corpse suit.

 I'm not sure this is going to work out.

 Oh, I get it.

 You won't hire me because I'm pretty.

 That could be a lawsuit.

 No lawsuit! You're hired! Okay, so I don't want to do anything that'll ruin my manicure.

 Well, then why do you want this job? So I can get manicures.

 Duh! Professor, could you say, "Welcome to Mother Hubbard's Sandwich Cupboard" without making any other noises? Of course I can, my dear child.

 Welcome to Mother Hubbard's uh Sandwich mcboing boing glavin flyvy hyvy goyvyn, and now I'm running to the unemployment office.

 Blervyk.

 (Marge groaning) I'm too nervous to sleep.

 (Homer grunts) (sighs) (grunts sleepily) (sighs aggressively) (stammers awake) I'm sorry I woke you up.

 I'm just so anxious about tomorrow.

 What if the store fails? What if I fail? Well, you woke up the right man in bed.

 I love you, Marjorie.

 And I've had my share of failures, sure.

 And sometimes I get pretty nervous.

 But thanks for talking it out with me.

 I think I can finally get to sleep now.

 No! No, no, no! It was me that couldn't get to (snoring) (sighs) (stammers awake) Oh, make love now? (groans) Say there, buddy, are you interested in our Two-For-One Tuesday? I never would have been, till I got this flyer! Interested in some exotic dancers, huh? Today's "Tell You Their Real Name" Tuesday.

 Are you working two jobs here, Gil? No, and I resent the accusation.

 Tell me, it's pointing west, right? Hola.

 No change for the meter.

 No, no, I'd like to see the manager.

 Mrs.

 Boss! Some fat blob wants to see you.

 MARGE: Homer! Marge.

 Come on, let's celebrate! It's your first day! Homie, I'm a little worried.

 Do you know there were no customers between 2:00 and 4:00? Hey, Tony Roma's wasn't built in a day.

 But don't worry, I told everyone about this place, and they're all going to support you.

 You do have drone delivery, right? I kind of promised that.

 We don't have drone delivery! You'll have to find a substitute.

 (humming a tune) HOMER: Damn it! (humming) (Marge groaning) (groans) What's wrong? Mother Hubbard Central expects you to buy a lot of stuff from them.

 Uniforms, fixin's.

 It's like they don't care if you make money as long as they make money.

 What kind of corporation does that? (stammers) I'm not trying to be political, but I'm the only one you can trust here.

 (gasps) Shauna! I saw that! I'm going to have to let you go.

 Oh, so you're, like, firing me like in that movie where that girl gets fired? I'm sorry.

 If I'm fired, then he's quitting! I am?! Oh, that's what holds them up.

 What am I going to do? I'm down two employees and it's the afternoon rush.

 (bell dings) I need a six-foot party sub.

 Lots of mayonnaise.

 And I mean lots.

 Never stop squirting mayo.

 Don't worry, baby.

 (humming a tune) Thank you, Homie.

 Why does this have to be so hard?! Oh, uh, sorry there, Marge.

 This is my changing room.

 You are working two jobs! No, these are my real legs.

 I'm I'm not a well man, Marge.

 This is so sad.

 In his homeland, Dad was a nuclear engineer.

 Oh, I was short-staffed and your father volunteered.

 Actually, I was wondering if you two might want to lend a hand.

 No, no.

 You want to make American kids work? You're supposed to be driving me to a tennis class I said I wanted, then I changed my mind and I hate it so much I'm faking stomachaches to get out of it.

 Would it kill one of you to wash a bell pepper? Um, I'm not sure this is the best use of my skills.

 I said wash! And, Bart, go work the deep fryer.

 Well, if I'll be doing this when I'm 40, might as well start now.

 (humming a tune) (gasps) I'm home.

 Guys, this is gonna be hard for a while.

 But we'll get through this as a family.

 Yes, we will.

 The Simpsons and old Uncle Gil.

 Uh, Gil? I've been meaning to tell you you're fired.

 Yeah, well, guess I had it coming.

 Can I take some bologna heels? As many as you like.

 You sure? Take them! Aw, yeah! It's a big ol' fat one!  The best things in life are free   But you can give them to the birds and bees   I need money   That's what I want   That's what I want   That's what I want   That's what I want   That's what I want   That's what I want   That's what I want   Your love give me such a thrill   But your love don't pay my bills   I need money   That's what I want   That's what I want   That's what I want   That's what I want  Good baby.

 Oh, yeah.

 Real good baby.

 Good everybody.

 You won't believe it, but we actually turned a profit today.

 Kids, we're taking some shredded lettuce, pre-sliced cheese and cold cuts, and turning them into the American dream.

 Uh, guys, what the hell is that? (gasps) They're opening another Mother Hubbard? Across the street?! How could they? How could they?! CHIEF WIGGUM: Move, move, move! Eh, Chief, uh, who are you fooling with this one sandwich a day diet? It's on whole wheat, Lou.

 Cleans up your insides.

 I'm gonna sit next to it.

 How could they open another franchise so close to me? Don't worry, Marge.

 They can't beat us.

 Because we're family-run.

 Aah! Hillbillies! Okay, in you go, Minimum Wade, Addem-up, Oxycontin, Fontanelle and Pediculus.

 You make way for those that's nocturnal coming off the night shift.

 (squealing) Huh? (sighs) (yawns) Mom, I need a few hours off.

 It's Milhouse's birthday party and I'm all the guests.

 I understand, honey.

 Did you get someone to cover? Mm.

 Grampa.

 I'm working the drive-through! There is no drive-through! (coos) No, thank coo! (sighs) (door opens, bell dings) Ah, finally-- a customer! Aah! Simpson, why aren't you at work? Whoa, hold that famous temper, Smithers.

 Who is this? Simpson, introduce me to this almond-eyed beauty, and all is forgiven.

 Uh, Mr.

 Burns, I'd like you to meet Mother Hubbard standee.

 From the Wisconsin Standees! Milk-fed, yet so slim.

 Permit me to play you a tune on my mouth organ.

 Sir, maybe we should go.

 Sorry you died! Put the body with the others.

 Whew.

 Homer, if I ever seem that senile, get a gun and What are you doing with that gun?! Marge, have you ever seen pants do this? (gasps) You're working so hard you've lost weight! We're killing ourselves trying to run a restaurant no one goes to.

 I've never said this to you before, but I'm saying it now.

 I'm going to Moe's.

 (gasps) Now I know why you come here so much.

 No matter how sad you are inside, what you see looks worse.

 Yeah.

 It was really hard for me to make this place look old but not in any way comfortable.

 Now maybe some TV will cheer you up.

 If you's in the mood for a sammich, come on down to Mother Hubbard's Sandwich Cupboard Express, for all the sandwiches you love! Bread sammich.

 Yesterday's what's-it with ketchup.

 And the thing what ate our chickens.

 BRANDINE: Looks like a fox, but it ain't.

 Be sure to follow us on Kinterest and Critter! Aw! "Yesterday's what's-it"? Why does everyone go to them? It's express, Marge.

 Yeah, with our busy lifestyle, we got to have express.

 Aw.

 Listen there, Midge.

 I know how to get yous out of your contract.

 But I got to warn you you will never work in the fast-food industry again.

 Go on.

 Please.

 So, you see, Ms.

 Zengler, the Mother Hubbard's Express across the street is stealing all our business.

 It's not fair.

 If you want fairness, work at a Sunglass Hut.

 This is the sandwich game.

 I don't understand you.

 I grew up in the pageant system.

 Oh.

 Now I completely understand you.

 I'm a litigious businessman, and I need a coffee to go.

 One jumbo Joe to go! (yells in pain) Get the first-aid kit! One Florence Nightingale in a box! And make it snappy! Ow! I got this.

 Ow! Oh, why do these things happen to innocent victims? I was just about to become a million-dollar crotch model! Hey, hey, hey! It's not corporate's fault! Really? But the franchise agreement says Mother Hubbard Inc.

 would provide adequate training for all employees, which they didn't.

 Clause 27C-3.

 (scoffs) You actually read this thing? It was written by two lawyers who had to keep waking the other one up.

 If you'll just give me back my original investment, I'll take full responsibility for this man's injuries.

 Please tell me I'm still beautiful! All right, Marge.

 You've got a deal.

 Well, family, we should be proud.

 We took on corporate America and broke even.

 Hear, hear! Sir? I-I think we've gone far enough to dispose of the body.

 Dispose? Ooh.

 I've come here to pitch woo.

 (groans)   (grunts) D'oh! Mmm.

 Sandwich.

 Shh!   


                





                    			 (Johnny Carson Tonight Show theme playing) KANG:  Live from Rigel 7, Conquerors of Rigels 4 through 6, it's the 25th annual Treehouse of Horror! With special guest stars Jennifer Lawrence, Warren Beatty, John Travolta, Clint Eastwood, George Clooney, Prince, Taylor Swift, Sean Penn, Bruce Springsteen, Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, James Franco, Kanye West and Leonardo DiCaprio.

 (applause and cheering) Why? (Kang and Kodos laughing) This has been a bad week, even for you, Simpson.

 Concrete in the sandbox? I don't get lost anymore! Spreading the rumor that today's lunch would be served by a naked lady.

 Move it! Boobs! Boobs! I want to see boobs in the soup! There is no naked lunch lady! Bart made it up! Yes, yes, I-I knew that.

 There's no hope for you, Simpson.

 You'll be locked in detention until you graduate to the penal system.

 (laughing) Penal.

 Stop laughing! I said "penal," not "penile.

" (laughs) Penile.

 It's not like you made me say "penis"! (laughing) (groaning) Hmm.

 Ow! Oh.

 Someone could get really hurt by this.

 Stick your finger in that desk.

 Really, Bart? Hmm, looks like ancient Aramaic.

 Fortunately, I have an app for that.

 (beep) (click, trilling, ding) Hey! "He who reads this rune translation will be taken to damnation"? (both gasp) (both scream) (hissing) (alarm sounding) SKINNER: Simpson! (hissing) (both grunt) BOTH: Huh? We're in Hell?! Cool! Now I can look up all those people who said "See you in Hell.

" Hey, pal, what are you in here for? Heresies, like Docetism.

 Docetism? The belief that Jesus' body was just an illusion.

 Is that still big? Haw-haw! Your heresies were venialized by the council of Palermo.

 Oh, shut up, shut up, shut up! (crowd chatter and groaning) We've got millipedes, toothheads, screaming torsos (screaming) your bleeding eyes with finger-legs.

 And all the girls are mean girls.

 Red dress, how original.

 Making fun of someone's clothes.

 How original.

 Huh.

 You want to walk with us? It's true.

 It would be a cold day in Hell when I was popular.

 Huh? Young man, where's your Hell pass? Skin him! Whoa.

 (gasps) (grunts) Huh? Hmm.

 So, what would be the appropriate eternal torture for someone who robbed a bank? (flame whooshing) Uh Someone who robs a bank.

 How would you punish them for all time? Mm Jeffistopheles? (in squeaky voice): Uh wh-whipping? Okay.

 Good.

 No one likes to be whipped, but is there anything more connected to the sin? Torture? What if you made the robber eat bags of money until his stomach exploded? Good.

 Very good.

 (high-pitched whooshing) Mm.

 Psychological torment.

 Pain plus fear.

 Oh, can you all feel how much richer that is? You get a pumpkin sticker.

 Ow.

 (gasps) This has never happened before.

 I have a crush on my teacher! Down here, we can make that happen.

 (locker door squeaks) (both giggle) Every time the sinner screams in pain, the scream blows this windmill, which pumps even more piranhas into his aquarium underwear, causing more screaming.

 Wow.

 Wow.

 Oh, that is so evil.

 And I know evil.

 I'm head of the teachers' union.

 (bell ringing) (grunting and groaning) Bart, I found a portal back to Earth.

 Right here? No, no, no, no! That's Super Hell! Hot Stuff? I didn't realize you were that evil.

 (Ã  la Droopy): No, I'm being punished for how lame my comics were.

 (whooshing) I melted it.

 Get it? (crow caws) (flames whooshing, hissing) Welcome to Earth.

 Local time is 10:37.

 We know you have your choice of portals, so thank you for choosing the Burns Hellport, a division of Gulf and Western.

 (Lisa pants, Bart grunts) Mom, Dad, I want to change schools.

 Hmm?! I found a place that really wants to teach me, and I really want to learn.

 Homie, our prayers have been answered.

 Keep your pants on, Marge.

 It's probably some private school that costs a million dollars a year, and then they squeeze you for extra money through book fairs and silent auctions.

 And parents get 20 e-mails a day from the school, and everyone hits "reply all" to everything.

 Dad, it's not a private school.

 It's free.

 Oh, that's fine then.

 (man screaming) I couldn't help noticing this school is located in I'm not one to judge, but, um I'll say it, Marge.

 It's in Hell! The Inferno! Perdition! Arizona without the golf! No.

 We do have golf, but all the greens are tricky.

 No! Look, as educators, our job is to gently nurture your child's passion.

 Hmm.

 That is the kind of nonsense you're always falling for.

 Mom, please tell me I can go to Hell.

 Well, I guess we could try it for a semester.

 Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! You know, we have many opportunities for parent involvement.

 (scoffs) Yeah, I'll be sure to take a look at that.

 (grunting)  Hell   Hell is for children   And you know that their little lives can become such a mess   Hell   Hell is for children   And you shouldn't have to pay for your love   With your bones and your flesh  Hmm.

  No, hell is for children.

  Now, students, it's final exam day, and none of you wants to repeat the class like a certain student I don't want to embarrass.

 Torture? Uh Beelzebart, you're first.

 And you're going to torment a very special sinner we've prepared just for you.

 Homer? That-That's my dad.

 I can't hurt him.

 No, boy.

 I want you to do it.

 What? Why? Bart, you went to Hell and came back a winner, like Jesus.

 Now, come on, boy.

 Pull me apart like string cheese.

 D'oh! D'oh! (shrieks) Webster defines success as the action of achieving one's goals.

 Don't you, Webster? I don't care! Why am I here? You changed the "R-E" to "E-R" in "theater.

" I hate that! Well, I'll tell you who is supposed to be here-- class mal-edictorian, Beelzebart Simpson.

 (applause and cheering) (Homer chuckling) Which one's yours? (grunting) Nice.

 MOE: That was me, when I was a young hoodlink, with me three bestest glugs, Leonard, Carlton and Dum.

 We was narsty tastards, we were, even though we dressed like Carol Channing's backup dancers.

 Some days, we'd employ a bit of the bash while having a go at the West End Wiseguys Ooh, stop it! Hey, pally, come on.

 Hey, what's wrong with youse? Ooh, I was told this would be a verbal debate! Ooh! and cap off the night with a little of the ol' in-out.

 ALL: In.

 Out.

 (bell dinging) In.

 Out.

 (bell dinging) In.

 Out.

 In.

 Out.

 (bell dinging) MOE: Everything was all fish and chippy until Dum collected himself a twiggy-wick.

 (with British accent): Hello, little lamb.

 What say we go back to my place for a little of the old Luther Van?  I can't fool myself, I don't want nobod  (William Tell Overture plays) Oy! I'm getting hitched to this bluebird, and she wants me to give up the glug life.

 Welly, welly, well, well, well.

 What sorry future could you have without your truest lunos by your side? Dum got a job at the Tower of London as a Beefeater! I hope it's what I think it is.

 MOE: Who knew, my brothers, that when Dum found his Dumpling that was the end of our band of glugs? Leonard and Carlton informed me my leadership was no longer needed.

 (grunting) Ah.

 Not the Shard! Not the Shard! (groaning) So I took up the respectable life of a sleazy barkeep.

 (sighs heavily) These eye clamps are the only way I can tolerate today's TV.

 TV ANNOUNCER: Tonight on Fox (groaning) Turn it off! I'll be good! (crying): I'll be good! (doorbell rings) There's been a terrible accident, sir.

 Please grant me access to your home.

 Are you kidding me? I invented that gag.

 Please, sir.

 Certainly a Christian is required to completely unbolt his door.

 Come on, you can't pull the wooly bull over my viddyballs.

 (groaning) That's a bit of the old haw-haw! (door squeaking) (Moe grunting) (grunting) Not my Shmoo! Not my Shmoo! (Moe crying) (Shmoo shatters) Those punks got no respect for them what come before.

 Didn't even wear no codpieces.

 How do they expect to draw the eye to their chunky-wunks? I need me glugs back for one last bit of barmy.

 No! You should not be out glugging, shin-slicing, or eye groining.

 We've got a sweet little toddle to take care of.

 (squeaking) (squeaking) Enough of this quiet home life! It's time to be a man again.

 After all these month-Os, I hope we don't disremember how to dash and bash.

 Let's start easy with a little walk into the jay.

 (siren blares) Wait! I recognize those cops what's be whackin' my gob-topper! It's Leonard and Carlton! (laughter) You blokes want to join me for one last bit o' noggin' boggin'? I saved your bowlers.

 Hmm? Hmm? MOE: Once again, the glugs was hittin' the streets all slow-motion like-- and just as scarifyin' and intimidato as ever.

 Hey, keep up! (panting) MOE: We put nasties in a hat and selectoed out one.

   (deep, echoing groaning nearby) Hey, what kind of Whoo-hoo is this? Welcome to the most frustrating, befuddling and, yes, erotic book release party you've ever attended.

 Sir, are you done with my bird mask? (chuckles): Oh, I don't think you want to wear it now.

 I'll be the judge of that.

 Come on, me glugs! Let's show these nectarinoes we're still the best at what we do: beatin' up old people and bare-naked ladies! Get them, becostumed weirdos! Sex-view blockers, keep blocking.

   I'll, uh, I'll let you finish.

 (ape-like grunting) ("Also Sprach Zarathustra" playing) I thought I left my iPhone here.

 (inquisitive grunt) (hammers cock) Ooh! Even I forget what this is a reference to.

 MOE: And so, O my brothers, I was beaten, I was bruised, I couldn't score at an orgy.

   But I was happy.

 All right, let's burn this, let's rewrite everything, and, uh, let's start all over.

 ("The Blue Danube" playing) (music stops abruptly) Ow.

 (tired mumbling) (low grunt) Stupid blood-- asking me for a favor! (grunts) Homer, Homer, look what someone left in the kitchen.

 Frosty chocolate milkshakes.

 Dad, the TV's screwed up.

 It only plays Married with Children.

 Aw, Peg, you're sick.

 Let me call Dr.

 Kevorkian.

 We haven't had sex in four years, Al.

 (audience jeers) Now I'm the one who needs Kevorkian.

 (audience laughter) VOICES (distorted): Our house.

 This house is haunted.

 (gasps) The milkshakes have vanished! (slurping) Hmm? What? (slurping)   Homie, I think we're not alone.

 I was sleeping in the dryer and got caught in your sheets.

 I'll go make up the couch for you.

 (whimpers) (Marge moaning amorously) Whoa, Marge, that was fast.

 Yeah, that's it, baby.

 Grab my chest with your cold, icy hands.

 (moans) (shrieks) The bed is lifting me! The elevator at work can't even do that.

 I demand you put me down right after the sex! D'oh! All right, show yourselves in the name of this book! D'oh! Oh.

 The power of Chrysler compels you! What are you, cavemen? Turn on the lights! (screaming) Hey! A little respect! (grumbles) Take a picture-- it'll last longer, man.

 Hey, if you're Homer Simpson, show me your driver's license! Well, I traded it to a kid for a bite of his sandwich.

 (gasps) He is me! Noble spirits, your time has passed.

 (belches) That was unmotivated.

 Don't have a cow, man.

 Shut up! Ay, caramba! (belches) Homer, do something! Why is it always me? I work 12 hours a week, you know.

 She doesn't know what a good thing she's got.

 I like a man who can relax.

 Not like Grumpy-Lumpy there.

 Quit makin' cracks! Speaking of cracks, pull up your pants, dude.

 I'll crack you! (grunting) (chuckling) What kind of afterlife is this? Can't even strangle my dead kid.

 So yeah, things aren't perfect with the missus and me, and, uh, by the way, nice melons.

 Those are in the kitchen! D'oh! I can't believe you wasted our money on fruit! (purring) Homer Simpson! Can you be more specific? (growling) (both chuckling) (giggles) Mmm! (grumbles) There's no reason to be jealous.

 It's just younger you.

 Oh! So, he likes ghosts better, eh? Fine.

 Hmm.

 Might as well clean this while I'm killing myself.

 (quiet grunting) (grunting) (thud) (humming a tune) Hmm? (chuckles): Well, hello-ho-ho.

 Aah! A ghost! I feel like a ghost, the way you haven't been paying attention to me.

 Plus, I'm dead.

 Don't yell at me-- I'm a double widower.

 But I can handle all the ghosts you can float at me.

 Won't the other Homer be a problem? Heh! I think he gets it.

 See? He You stupid What the? Ooh! Mmm, I smell toast.

 (groans) (whoosh) Well, I guess you and I are in charge now, Bart.

 But if we split the chores, I'm sure that we c What are you doing?! Sayonara, sucker! Oh, no, you're not leaving me to clean this up! (yells) (grunts) (whoosh) Whoo-hoo! I'm the last of the Simpsons! In I.

Q.

 only! Huh? (grunts, coughs, groans) GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE: Thank you! Willie's got stew for the winter.

 Wait a minute-- who killed Maggie? This is all your fault, Homer, for wanting somebody new.

 I just wanted the woman I married.

 I never realized you had so much work done.

 Simpsons, please! This fighting solves nothing! Dr.

 Marvin Monroe?! Are you alive or dead? (groans) I'm in some horrible limbo.

 I can walk halfway through walls, then I get stuck.

 (creaking) Uh-oh.

 Now I'm gonna have to look at that every morning.

 Well, I think you're helping us make progress.

 Thank you.

 Let's not fight anymore.

 Let's just make him decide between us.

 Choose me because I'm not bitter yet, I can stay up later, and you're on my mind all the time.

 Hmm, Marge number two, how would you win my whoopie? Those are great reasons, but there's one reason you should choose me: because I know everything you've done, and yet I still want to be with you.

 That is so beautiful.

 (both sigh) You're right, Marge-- I could never leave you, not even for you.

 If there was a dot or a squiggle different, that would be too much.

 Oh, Homie! Oh, Homie! (all moaning) It's time to cut the treacle, man.

 Why, you little! (birds chirping) Mmm (belches) (loud chewing, belching continues) (whoosh) I just had a worrisome thought.

 If there can be two incarnations of the Simpsons, why couldn't some evil marketing entity produce millions of others? (new Homer voice): All right, Simpsons, welcome to our new home.

 Yo, yo, Santa's Little Helper is in da house! (howls) (fierce grunt)   Mmm! (squeaky gibberish) (high-pitched): D'oh! Okay, hold still.

 This is the last picture on the roll.

 Isn't it about time you went digital? Watch your mouth, you little smart-ass.

 ORIGINAL LISA: Yeah, Bart.

 Nothing's gonna ruin this one.

 (timer ticking) Here we go.

 Here we go.

 Here we go.

 (gulping) (flash pops, camera whirs) HOMER: D'oh! (screaming)   


                





                    			 HOMER (laughs): Whoo! Pork chops with gravy! Wait.

 But today's not Pork Chop Tuesday.

 Or Gravy Thursday! I also set up some mirrors so you could watch hockey fights while you eat.

 Whoo-hoo! Oh, I love Canadian-on-Canadian violence.

 Oh, baby, this is so great! Thank you so much.

 I'm just happy you're happy.

 Wait a minute, that's not something people really feel.

 What's going on? Well, I do have a favor.

 Patty and Selma came home early from their vacation, but the cleaners still haven't gotten all the black mold out of their apartment.

 (deep roar) So they need a place to stay.

 Here.

 (shrieks) Paris was a bust.

 They wouldn't even let us see the Mona Lisa.

 They kept yelling, "La Joconde! Her smile will die!" No, Marge, no! You can't invite a couple of Riddlers to stay in the Bat Cave! You ate the food and looked in the mirrors.

 They're staying! (gruff chuckling) (inhaling, exhaling loudly) (Bart and Lisa coughing) Hmm.

 Oh, honey, one teensy problem with this plan.

 I'm a teensy bit concerned about them smoking around the children.

 You know, their lungs are so teensy.

 Mwah! Mwah! Hmm.

 He has a point.

 No, no.

 No, no, we don't have to smoke.

 We can stop whenever we want.

 See? (hissing) (both grunt) Okay, how about this-- if you catch us smoking in the house, even one time, you can throw us out on the street.

 You know what? I trust them not to smoke.

 And if you trust them, I trust them, too.

 (devious chuckling) Safety first! Screw this.

 We'll just go outside.

 Nature is God's ashtray.

 (grunting) (thunder crashes) Bad news, bears.

 Forecast calls for nothing but rain.

 (both groaning) (grunting) (glass shatters) (humming) Here we go.

 Problem solved.

 Electric cigarettes.

 (loud inhaling) Choke on our harmless fumes.

 Hmm? Well, if you fall asleep with them, will you even burn to death? BOTH: Uh-uh.

 Oh.

 (loud, rapid inhaling and exhaling) They call these cigarettes? They don't stain my fingers, my hair smells like hair, and what do I stub out in my scrambled eggs? Sure, it's got the nicotine, but where's the tar? Where's the stab from every breath that reminds me I'm alive? No smoke detector! Let's roll! (both grunting) Wait, wait.

 Turn on the faucet so no one'll get suspicious.

 (explosion) (smoke detectors beeping) Aha! I gotcha! (beeping stops) You can't resist smoking in the house any more than I can resist drinking in the car.

 What happened? I don't know.

 The water caught on fire.

 (gasps) And now I banish you from paradise.

 I'm glad I never bothered to learn which one of you is which.

 Please, show some compassion for two good people who just can't stop smoking.

 Hmm hmm.

 I know just the place.

 (tires screech) (coughing) (both sniffing) Oh! (shudders) Tobacco! (both chuckling excitedly) (loud inhaling, exhaling) Who needs Paris? This is our City of Lights!   Flaming tap water.

 I saw something about that in a documentary.

 Sad.

 Sad.

 Sad.

 Sad.

 Sad.

 Sad.

 Sad.

 Sad.

 Sad.

 Cute.

 (gasps) This one! MALE NARRATOR: In this rural community, hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, was greeted as a windfall.

 (crowd cheering) By pumping high-pressure liquid into underground shale deposits, fracking releases natural gas, but can lead to devastating environmental consequences.

 (whooshes) Yep, used to be you could try burning your water all day and nothing would happen.

 Henry, did you remember to turn off the Slip 'N Slide? (children laughing) (explosion, screaming) Well, I reckon not.

 I think someone is fracking under our neighborhood.

 And I know who.

 It's you, Mr.

 Texan.

 Oil wasn't enough-- now you're going after our natural gas.

 Aw, now, ain't nothing natural about gas.

 If you can't dance in it, I ain't drilling for it.

 I don't do this for the money, it's the dancing.

 It's always been the dancing.

 (whooping and laughing) (both sigh) All right! BART: Oh, man.

 He made us watch him dance for three hours, and he really only has one move.

 If someone was fracking in our neighborhood, wouldn't we know it? Maybe a satellite picture will give us a clue.

 Hmm, this is clearly a fracking site.

 How are they keeping people away? (wind whistling) Aw, it's a terrific sport Shh! This whole building is just a facade for a drilling operation.

 Indeed it is.

 Evergreen Terrace is built atop a massive shale deposit.

 Think of it-- all that poor natural gas trapped underneath your shanties and lean-tos.

 Smithers, give these two brats what they deserve for sticking their noses in my business.

 (both groan) (groans) Stopping Mr.

 Burns may be beyond the power of an eight-year-old girl with a book report due on Beezus and Ramona, but I know someone who can help: the first female Speaker of the State Assembly, a politician who would never ignore a fellow environmentalist in need, my hero, Maxine Lombard.

 (gasps) Charge the electric limo-- we're going to Springfield.

 What about your cool-down period? What about it?! Lisa! Motorcade! Assemblywoman Lombard! You got my e-mails! I'll go anywhere, anytime, to defend our precious Bay Area values.

 (gasps) Terrible! Just shocking.

 D-Does anybody have a baby we can hold near the flames? I guess I do.

 (sighs) I'm gonna hit this Mr.

 Burns with a politician's most powerful weapon: an invitation to a committee hearing.

 Mr.

 Burns, do you admit that you illegally pump toxic chemicals into the groundwater below Evergreen Terrace? (indistinct whispering) I don't recall.

 Mr.

 Burns! Have you no regard for the life and health of your fellow human beings? (indistinct whispering) I don't recall.

 You can't drill underneath people's homes without their permission.

 As chairwoman of this Committee on Energy, Natural Resources and Blimp Safety, your fracking operation is hereby shut down.

 (groans) I demand to see that capitalism-castrating suffragette this instant! You haven't bested me.

 I will find a way to shatter that shale.

 What makes men like you think you can do whatever you want to our planet? Maybe the planet wants a strong man to take her by the hand and lead her.

 You don't know what the planet wants.

 Oh, and I suppose you do? The planet wants to be protected and nourished and maybe even Kissed.

 (both moan) Mwah!   Wait a minute, I'm not having a stroke, am I? No.

 Am I? I don't think so.

 Oh, good.

   (both gasp) You! Me? (shudders) This was all a mistake-- an impulsive Reckless knee-buckling spat-snapping Spanx-shredding mistake.

 (sighs): Oh, it was great.

 (chuckles): Best I've ever had.

 And that includes Nellie Taft.

 So, Monty, shall we find a way to continue this purely passionate affair? But you're a softhearted liberal! And you're a hard-hearted capitalist.

 Enemies by day, lovers by night.

 Mmm mwah! Now, get out of my office.

 As soon as I collect my things.

 Uh, derringer, sword cane, derringer cane, sword derringer.

 All right, it's all here.

 If I want to resume fracking, I have to buy the mineral rights for every single parcel of land in Evergreen Terrace.

 To win people over, I'll need a salesman whose folksy facade masks a deep gusher of greed.

 Hmm? (chuckles) Congratulations, Simpson! You're now my chief energy innovation marketing officer.

 Whoo-hoo! All you've got to do is sell fracking to your friends and neighbors.

 Whoo-hoo? I don't know, "fracking" is one of those scary Lisa words.

 Bah! Fracking produces enough clean natural gas to make America independent of sheiks, caliphs and Scandinavians.

 Not to mention, it doesn't create any of that awful worker-mutating nuclear waste.

 Homer, game starts in an hour.

 Don't forget to set your fantasy lineup.

 Thanks, Charlie.

 Maybe fracking isn't so bad.

 Then say yes to this raise, this promotion and this flannel shirt, which says: "I'm not screwing you over.

" I'm not screwing you over.

 No, uh, I'm not screwing you over.

 I'm not screwing you over.

 (crying): I'm so proud of you, Papa.

 Some folks will tell you that fracking's no good, but what they don't tell you is, hydraulic fracturing creates jobs.

 And all those new workers are gonna want to spend their earnings buying what you're selling-- beer.

 Authentic Italian food.

 Useless left-handed crap.

 Magical nonsense.

 Expensive toys for grown-ups they don't open or play with.

 Pornography and nachos.

 High-quality Spanish-language programming.

 High-quality methamphetamines.

 Laundry, homework, pranks, poop, poop and poop.

 But our water was on fire.

 How could you sell fracking for Mr.

 Burns? 'Cause I've never gotten a promotion before.

 Once I thought I had, but it turned out to be a beautifully-worded firing, so judge me all you want.

 I am judging you.

 Good.

 Judge away.

 Judge, judge, judge, judge, judge.

 Don't care.

 Don't care.

 Judge, judge, judge, judge, judge, judge.

 Don't care.

 Don't care.

 Judge, judge, judge.

 Judge, judge.

 Don't care.

 Don't care.

 Pumping frack cash.

 It's a gas cash blast? Residents of Evergreen Terrace are undecided whether to sell their mineral rights to Mr.

 Burns.

 Mr.

 Burns is a vampire sucking the lifeblood of this town and lining his coffin with cash.

 Oh, Maxine, no one insults me in a sound bite the way you do.

 Oh, Monty, you're such a sexy little Nosferatu.

 Same time tomorrow night? (chuckles) I'll bring the oxygen.

 (quietly): Better bring two tanks.

 Hmm? FRINK: And so, we see a clear correlation between industrial hydro compounds and water table contamination well outside the margin of error.

 Mr.

 Simpson, rebuttal? (clears throat) Everyone who signs over their mineral rights to Mr.

 Burns gets $5,000.

 Money is like a job you don't even have to do! (dance music playing) Ay, dinero.

 Signing Stu.

 (laughter) I think my arguments were more cogent-- Bo-hyvik.

 What?! Cogent-- Bo-hyvik! Mr.

 Burns, we did it! Everyone in the neighborhood sold us their gas rights! Hmm.

 Excellent.

 No, no.

 It's excellent.

 It's excellent.

 Uh, maybe you can help me, Simpson.

 You've had a relationship or two in your life.

 (laughing): Well one.

 I have embarked on a "beneficial friendship" with a woman with whom I have nothing in common.

 Her opinions are abhorrent to me, but the passion.

 Well, look at these racy texts she sends me.

 (rhythmic clicking) Oh, baby.

 How long can I sustain this high-wire act of loathing and lust? Well, I'm no Carl when it comes to this stuff, but I ain't no Lenny, neither.

 And I would say no matter how much you try to keep things casual, someone always gets hurt.

 Hmm.

 Well, then I must harden my heart against such an outcome.

 I appreciate the counsel, Simpson.

 Now, please trap-door yourself out.

 Glad I could be of help! (indistinct chatter) Do you have the signed gas leases? BURNS: Hold on.

 This feels light.

 Ah.

 One of these deeds is missing a signature.

 The gas rights transfer form for 742 Evergreen Terrace was never signed by Marge Simpson.

 (gasps) Marge, why didn't you sign? Our water was on fire! I'm sorry, but the law states that unless every single resident sells their rights, Burns can't frack drop one! ALL: Oh! Oh, I was counting on that money to pay for my other calf implant.

 Yuck.

 I already felt the pride of energy independence.

 (loud, overlapping crowd chatter) Marge Simpson, I'm as mad at you as you usually are at me! (gasps) Hmm! (indistinct chatter) (wind whistling) Cheer up, Monty.

 All you lost was money, but what you get is me.

 (cracking) All I lost was money? (laughs) Let me make one thing perfectly clear.

 Our dalliance meant nothing to me! You were but a sprig of parsley garnishing my beefsteak.

 Now I cast you aside for the busboys to gnaw upon.

 Considered this ill-conceived affair terminated! (gasps) (chuckling) I played this just perfectly.

 Oh, yeah, great.

 Great, Marge, great work.

 Thanks to you, Springfield will never be a natural gas boomtown, and like all boomtowns, it would have lasted forever.

 Oh! Our water was on fire! Oh! Was on fire.

 Was! I finally got a job I was good at, and now I have to give it up! So, you've come begging not to be fired? Smithers, turn my back on this man! Maximum huff! Wait, Mr.

 Burns.

 I'm here to man up.

 It was all my wife's fault! (sighs heavily) Sometimes I think she and I have nothing in common! Nothing in common, eh? Tell me more.

 Marge likes sushi.

 I like gum that squirts in your mouth.

 She's into romantic comedies.

 I like movies where there's only one day a year when murder is legal.

 Yup, Marge and I see the world in totally different ways.

 Hmm.

 Different, exactly.

 That's why I had to give my woman the old heave-ho.

 So, you don't miss that politics lady at all? Not for one Chinese second.

 And I'm sure she's forgotten all about me.

 (both gasp) Killdozers.

 Whatever are you doing, man?! We're tearing down this place and putting up a recycling center, slash Native American history museum, slash condor sanctuary.

 (screeching) Hmm.

 A project this bloated and ill thought out could only be the work of an angry liberal.

 (gasps) Maxine! My ex is using the thing I hate most against me-- big government.

 (grunts) (camera shutter clicking) Stop this ribbon cutting! This is private property! What's the matter, Mr.

 Burns? Never heard of eminent domain? You're just doing this to get back at me for dumping you! That is ridiculous.

 (gasps) The Antonin Scalia bedroom! It's a National Public Radio broadcast center now.

 Who are you? I'm Robert Siegel, and this is All Things Considered.

 (theme music playing) Stop laying about, you! There's work to be done! (weakly): Or Gravy Thursday.

 If that woman thinks she's been scorned now, she ain't seen nothing yet! (clacking) It's fracking time.

 (squeaking) (whooshing) (rumbling) (groaning) (Bart groaning) (grunts) (groans) Is one of the side effects of fracking earthquakes? (voice shaking): Yes! (rumbling continues) What are you doing? You're destroying this neighborhood.

 Just like you destroyed my mansion.

 I don't know what I ever saw in you, you planet-ruining monster! Likewise, you planet-saving succubus! (metallic rattling) Homer, turn off that horrible machine! You don't know anything about hydraulic fracturing! You've just been brainwashed by liberal TV shows who use fracking as an easy bad guy, but it can save this country! Our water was on fire! Wait.

 I finally get what you're saying.

 Fracking is great, but the only place it should ever happen is in other people's towns! Hmm.

 (grunting) (whooshing) (grunting nervously) You always do the right thing sort of.

 What is he doing? He was furious at that woman, now he's embracing her.

 He told me himself they had nothing in common.

 Nothing except passion.

 Mm.

 (cracking) (hearts beating) I was a fool to break up with you, Maxine.

 I'm sorry I turned your home into a liberal paradise.

 You think we could make us work? I don't know.

 We're pretty different.

 But we've got passion, and as long as we've got that, our lives will never get boring.

 Mmm.

 Well, there's free jazz on Saturdays at the art museum.

 Now they say omega-3 pills are bad for you.

 My sister's dog had puppies.

 What kind? What kind of what? What kind of dog does your sister have? I don't know.

 What color drawer pulls did you want? Nickel or brush nickel? Oh, I wish we'd bought the more expensive theater tickets.

 I'll never see anything in row BB.

 There's a sale on lawn furniture at the Lawns Plus.

 Why are all cars black or gray now? It's like if you see a red one, it's a big deal.

 I'm thinking about wearing a watch again.

 Shh!   


                





                    			 (Futurama theme plays)  Two two, three  Ooh.

 Wiggle in.

 Get comfortable.

 (Marge yells) Hey, a couch is a couch.

 (grunts) Ooh, yeah.

 (sexy lounge music playing) (chuckling) (moaning) Yes, there, you see? Oh, yeah! (giggles) (laughing) Oh-ho-ho-ho! That's so HOMER: Whoo-hoo! SKINNER: Uh, students, each one of you has been assigned the mandatory honor of contributing to the Springfield time capsule, where your arcana will lie dormant until the 31st century.

 And (grunts) By the time you finish talking, we're gonna be opening this damn capsule.

 Right.

 Time capsule.

 Nelson, give me something.

 I brought a picture of my dad.

 He's still at large (voice breaks): in my heart! I brought my lucky rabbit's foot.

 I can have good luck without it.

 (gasps) Ow! Wish we could put this moment in the time capsule.

 Consider it done.

 Uh, how about you, Bart? Let me guess-- you forgot to bring something.

 I'm offended you think I forgot.

 Let's see.

 Ta-da! Listen, boy, this is the only legacy you'll ever leave.

 Better make this count.

 (blows nose) (gasps) My sandwich! (devious chuckle) And so a thousand years from now this capsule will be opened by some future Mayor Quimby.

 (crowd cheers) That-that could be anyone's ooze.

 (truck backup alarm beeping) (grunts) There.

 And now, to help secure the jazz vote, Lisa Simpson will play her saxophone.

   (thunder crashes) Even God hates jazz.

 (thunder rumbling) KENT BROCKMAN: A mysterious electrical storm is currently wreaking havoc with our studio.

 (chuckles): But I'm not one of those brainless dolts who mindlessly reads a teleprompter-er error 401 backslash backslash colon reset C-drive shutting down.

 (electrical zapping) (male screaming) (crash) (grunts) What the hell was that? Probably just another piece of America's space junk falling out of orbit.

 Remember when this country didn't suck? 'Cause I don't.

 (thunder crashing) (loud glugging in distance) (loud belch) (glass shatters) (gasps) Homer, I think there's someone downstairs.

 Relax, Marge.

 It's probably just Homer coming home late from Moe's.

 Hmm.

 Ooh, the eyes in that picture are following me! Uh, that's a mirror.

 Isn't all great art kind of a mirror? (door creaks) (deep belching nearby) We'd better send the dog down.

 Come on, here's your chance to protect us, boy.

 (whining) Come on.

 C (growls) Aah! Stupid dog.

 (growling) Ow! (clattering in distance) MALE VOICE: Ow.

 We'll have to set a trap, Bait-- I mean, Bart.

 HOMER: All set.

 When he starts gnawing at you, I'll whack him with this broom.

 (gasps) Hmm.

 Ooh! (chuckles) Don't drink my loved ones! Oh! Bite my shiny metal ass! A robot! With a catchphrase! Hey, Homer, you gonna kiss him or kill him? (grunts) (yells) All right! Tether-boy! (grunting) (grunting) (yelling) (Bender chuckles) Okay, so, what are you? Must be a secret government project.

 Whoa, what do I look like, a narc? My name is Bender, and I come from the future! Prove it.

 What happens to Homer Simpson in the future? I don't know.

 You die? Oh my God.

 He's telling the truth.

 I have to take you to our civic leaders.

 (deep belch) Hey, hibachi head, how are you gonna pay for that? Uh, let me just transfer some, uh, electronic hyper- credits into your register here.

 Ding-da-ding- ding-ding-ding- ding-ding! Ooh, and, uh, another round for my friends! Ding-da-ding-ding- da-ding-ding.

 (others cheer) (chuckles): Hey, this blade rummy is all right.

 He's a big spender, plus he fixed the jukebox.

 (quietly): I think they had a thing going.

  Oh, baby, what you done to me  (needle scratches record) I hate it when they get quiet.

 Listen, uh, I know you're a robot and incapable of emotion (sobbing): It's true.

 I'm empty inside! (sobbing loudly) Uh, look, I just want to ask, can we be friends? You're the only guy I know with less hair than me.

 Sure.

 That's why I came to your time-- for all you know.

 OTHERS: For all we know! (chuckling) D'oh! (mechanical whirring) A, uh, strike! A totally legitimate strike! Yeah! (chuckles) Hey, uh, what's the robot version of bro-Mance? Ro-Mance.

 You future guys have a word for everything pal.

 (both snoring) You know, they look a little similar.

 Yeah.

 Like the guy who designed Bender just took a drawing of Dad and stuck an antenna on it.

 LISA: A little lazy, if you ask me.

 Regardless, I see no reason to believe that Bender is from the future.

 Robotic technology today is very advanced.

 Oh, really? Can your modern-day robots do this? ("The Stars and Stripes Forever" playing) It's not my birthday-- although Maggie's is pretty soon.

 I can't do "Maggie.

" The Gs look like sixes.

 This is the robot who claims to be from the future.

 Can your present-day robots do this? (babbling) Uh, no, no, they cannot.

 Not sure why they'd want to-- gorbid.

 Now, why are you here? What is your mission, uh, so to speak? I don't remember.

 Man, this guy doesn't ask permission-- he just goes right in you.

 Eh aha! Bender's mission protocol is definitely intact.

 It just requires a delicate procedure known as "unplug and re-plug.

" (chuckles, mumbles) Because that fixes everything.

 (whirring) I remember why I'm here! To kill Homer Simpson! (gasps) (singsongy): My ears are burning.

 (singsongy): Not yet, but they will be.

 (yelps) A boxing glove! But we bowled together.

 Aw, I can't do it.

 What stopped you, Bender, Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics? You think robots care what some hack science fiction writer thinks? I killed Isaac Asimov on the way over here.

 Well, Isaac somebody.

 What the? My ass is about to project something.

 (loud whisper): You don't have to announce it.

 Just do it quietly and blame the dog.

 Bender, we've just regained contact.

 Have you killed Homer Simpson? Uh, yep.

 Killed him good.

 If Homer's dead, why are the creatures he begat still here and multiplying out of control? (all chattering angrily) What the? You lied to me, Bender! Homer Simpson's still alive! Come on, Bender, stabbity-stabbity.

 Wait! Stop! Why must you kill my dad? Especially when cheeseburgers are doing the work for you.

 Homer Simpson must be eliminated immediately.

 The creatures destroying New New York have his DNA.

 The monsters are stealing our office supplies! That's inexcusable! Gah! Um Hello, robot.

 Looks like everyone gets a turn to say something.

 This concludes my turn.

 We sent Bender back in time to kill Homer before the monsters could evolve from him.

 Apparently, this was too heartless a task for a robot.

 Leela, can you handle it? In a New New York minute minute.

 (explosion) (grunts) Ow! (chuckles) Ow! Right in my language center! (jittery gibberish) Professor, y-you're a fellow man of science.

 Maybe if we teamed up, we could, uh, figure something out.

 Okay.

 Eh, but remember, to me you're incredibly stupid.

 Oh, and the annoying girl may be helpful.

 Meanwhile, Leela, take Homer and explore this time period.

 Find out why people would ever pay for "freemium games.

" I'll explain.

 Okay, it starts free, right? Then you visit your friend's game, and he's got this awesome candy mansion Get a load of those freaks! And you're like, "99 cents?! You bet I'd like one!" And that's why I owe Clash of Candies $20,000.

 Here we are.

 Marge, I'd like you to meet Leela and Fry.

 MARGE: Oh, don't mention her eye.

 Don't mention her eye.

 LEELA: Don't mention her hair.

 Don't mention her hair.

 I am so pleased to meet you.

 Nice to be hair.

 (laughs) (soft grumble) Oh, Lord.

 (professors mumbling) Professor Farnsworth, I'm dying to know how you got here.

 Was it a time machine? Little girl, time machines are physical impossibilities.

 We teleported through a singularity that I quantum entangled to Bender under the guise of fixing his collar.

 Yes, but how did Bender get here? With a time machine.

 But you just said that (bell dings) Sample's ready! (snores) Kill all humans.

 (snores) Kill all humans.

 (snores) Start with Flanders.

 (snores) Start with Flanders.

 Good news, everyone! That means it's bad.

 The human DNA in the creatures was only half Homer's.

 The other half came from someone else.

 Oh, so we can kill that person instead.

 Maybe they're evil and deserve it.

 Or have one of those annoying voices that gets on everybody's nerves, with the adding extra noises for no reason.

 Myveen.

 Bloingy.

 And the other person is HOMER: Oh, who's that? It's me.

 (gasps) Wait a minute.

 We don't have to kill you.

 Oh, well, that's better.

 We just have to kill all your children.

 (exclaims) Or just one of them.

 If you can figure out which one sired the killer rabbits.

 (whistling) (rattling) We interrupt this hologram to bring you an important bulletin.

 The horrific creatures destroying New New York have begun metamorphosing.

 (laughs) (muffled screaming) (grunting) (all growling) (man gasping) Eat my shorts! Ay, caramba! Ay, caramba! (laughs) What a surprise.

 It's Bart.

 BART: Wow, I'm doing the same jokes a thousand years later.

 Ay, caramba! But how did a mere boy destroy the future? Well BART: Let this be a lesson.

 Never throw meaningless crap in a time capsule.

 That's it! All we have to do is dig up the time capsule.

 And bury Bart in the hole.

 I thought people in the future would be more full of peace and love.

 Like in Epcot Center.

 In our time, Epcot Center is a work farm for the weak.

 Oh, but it's not as crowded as the slave labor camps at Universal Studios.

 (grumbles) (tires screeching) HOMER: We're here.

 (chuckles) My bowling buddy.

 GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE: Hey! You can't dig that up for a thousand years.

 Plus, I wrote my name there.

 See? (rattling) Shmayday! Shmayday! (gasps) They got Scruffy! Nope.

 They just got my mustache.

 But a life without a mustache ain't worth livin'.

 FARNSWORTH: No! That generator powers the portal.

 If they destroy it, we'll be (exclaims) (grunts) sucked back into the future.

 Okay, head count.

 One, two, three (gasps) Where's Maggie? Well, little meatbag, it looks like it's just you and me.

 Stuck in a terrible past where I know the result of every horse race ever! To the track! I want that.

 Well, you can't have it.

 Why, you little Why, you little Why, you little Why, you little Why, you little Dad, it's me.

 Prove it.

 When's your birthday? February 23rd.

 Ha! February has no 23rd.

 You (grunts) (grunting) Yes, it does.

 Can you please just get us out of this lousy future? Actually, of all probable futures, this is the worst.

 It is, 'cause my baby's not in it.

 Motherly love.

 Why did we outlaw that? Madam, our mechanical friend Bender is your portal home.

 But we can't use him until the generator is repaired.

 Homer works at a nuclear plant.

 He can help us get home.

 Oh, are you good at your job? I was voted employee of the month as an April Fools' Day joke.

 Why, you little Why, you little Great.

 You and Fry can bumble around together while the rest of us give up and make peace with our various deities.

 As for me, I'm an atheist.

 Oh, nobody's father, who art nowhere, I know you can't hear me, completely ignore this prayer.

 Nothing art thou and nothing will thou ever be.

 Jesus was just a man.

 ALL: Amen.

 Well, I shall stay here for the decadence.

 There's no debauchery like end-of-the-world debauchery.

 Your lips, my lips, apocalypse, ooh! I can't believe you're all giving up without a fight.

 Lisa, we're just a package delivery service.

 And not a very good one.

 The only way to handle the creatures is to do what we do to each year's Super Bowl losers: shoot them into space.

 But we'd have to round them up first.

 Let me take care of that.

 If there's one thing I know how to do, it's manipulate Bart.

 You're nuts.

 I've got a will of iron.

 (deep humming) (mumbles) Okay, let's get going.

 (drooling) Dad, we have beer in our time.

 Hey, I haven't had a drink in a thousand years.

 (horse neighs) (gasps) There's a horse called Bender's Bounty.

 But my memory says he died during the race.

 That can't be true.

 ANNOUNCER: And way, way, way back is Bender's Bounty.

 Damn it! Oh, chief, it looks like a robot killing horses over there.

 Oh, a 608 Lou, can't you just let me enjoy my day off? W-Why are you dressed in your uniform, then? 'Cause they're the only clothes that fit me.

 You happy? Happy? LISA: Attention, goblins.

 Madison Cube Garden is filled with Butterfinger bars.

 And people are laying fingers all over them.

 (cackling, grunting) They're evolving.

 Wow.

 That's a first for you, Bart.

 Will you shut up? (gentle melody plays) (grunting) Uh, did I remind you to strap yourselves in? (all cheering) You realize you're cheering the death of millions of my children.

 (all cheering) Wow, it's working.

 I guess the instructions were in English.

 What the Whoa! Hey, here's a souvenir photo of you guys coming out of my chest.

 Aw, I will treasure this forever.

 Lie detected.

 Oh, my sweet baby.

 Oh, feels like you have a full diaper.

 Ooh, um, I'll change her.

 (whispers): Here's your cut.

 Nice knowing you, meatbags.

 Have fun turning to dust.

 Wait, wait, wait.

 You're the portal.

 How are you gonna get to the future? The old-fashioned way.

 Good night, friend.

 You'll always have a special place here with us.

 (grunting) Thanks, pal.

 Look at this mess.

 It would have disintegrated upon entry if someone hadn't turned off the atmosphere last night.

 I like it cold when I'm sleeping.

 Besides, these horrible Earth creatures are delicious.

 The Johnsons will be here for dinner any minute.

 What happened to the handsome man I married? I ate him, remember? Here they are.

 Uh, hmm Hope we're not interrupting anything.

 (burps) I can't take any more.

 (sobbing) I-I can't take it.

 Well, perhaps the one of you that is female should go console her.

 (Futurama theme plays)  Two two, three  HOMER:  Simpsons in the future   Space jokes flying through sound   What are those tubes?   I wonder what   Ice cream's like now   Maybe it's hot   Or some new temperature they invented.

  That's it, we're done.

 (The Simpsons theme plays) Shh!   


                





                    			 KODOS: You and your stupid makeup.

 We missed Halloween! D'oh! (tires screeching) (grunts) Ooh! (yawns) CHALMERS: Ah, ah, ah.

 I'd like to welcome all of the principals from the Springfield School District, including Skin-ner! Wein-berg! Sack-ett! And Gwendolyn Hertz-feld-Mastroantonio! We are here for the annual Dance of the Lemons, where each of you gets to trade your worst teacher to another school.

 The union's happy, the parents are placated, and only the children suffer.

 (over video, whispering): Chalmskinn.

 Behold your lemons! Sociopathic child haters who are only teachers because they got tenure after two short years.

 That's mean! You know what you are.

 (Taser buzzing) Uh, first lemon: from Springfield Elementary, going to West Springfield, third grade teacher, Sticky-Fingers Stella.

 Now, going to Springfield Elementary God have mercy.

 Seymour, your new teacher is Everybody pray! This is a public school.

 I said pray! Mr.

 Lassen is here.

 No smoking.

 So, Mr.

 Lassen, you began your career at Shelbyville Prep.

 It seems that certain wealthy parents didn't like seeing their precious darlings duct-taped to the wall.

 Mm-hmm.

 And then you entered the public system.

 That's where I got this scar.

 What scar? Oh, I see you're left-handed.

 So, that concludes my evaluation.

 Enjoy fourth grade.

 So, any dirt on the new teacher? Is he stingy with the pumpkin stickers? Does he have OCD? OCD? OCD? I don't know.

 But in ten minutes, I'm gonna have him kneeling before Zod.

 In this example, I'm Zod.

 (thumping) When he opens the door That's kind of scary, but it doesn't make me pee my pants.

 Hello.

 (screams) I'm Mr.

 Lassen.

 You mean Mr.

 Less-than? (students giggle) So, a comedian, are you? I got a pretty solid ten minutes.

 Well, I could do five minutes on your pathetic vest and five minutes on your ugly buck teeth.

 And I've got a whole HBO special's worth on your fat mama! My mom can't afford to be fat-- she's an exotic dancer.

 (chuckling): Oh! And in what exotic location does she dance? A Touch of Class.

 But the "C-L" fell off.

 Son, there was never a "C-L.

" I-I think I always knew that! (sobbing) Bart, this guy served two tours in middle school.

 Abort prank! I will not.

 Anything to delay a spelling test.

 (thumping) Looks like I've got a prankster on my hands.

 (chuckles) You know, son, school code says a student's hair should be of uniform length.

 What are you gonna do to him? Quiet Smellson.

 Smellson? I prayed no one would ever think of that! (razor buzzing) BART: Ay, caramba.

 How was your first day at school, Bart? Terrible.

 You want to talk about it? No.

 Oh, thank you.

 Why are you wearing your hat at dinner? This new teacher I got gave me a haircut.

 MARGE: Hmm? A haircut? Let me see.

 No.

 Come on.

 Please? No, you'll laugh at me.

 I won't laugh at you.

 Let's see.

 (laughing) Look at me.

 I'm Bart.

 We're sorry.

 (laughing) (laughing) Stop that, all of you.

 It's not Bart's fault that his haircut looks so stupid.

 (Homer giggles) I didn't know that a teacher could cut kids' hair.

 Teachers' union won the right in their last strike.

 I'm going to go to that school and talk to that teacher.

 Marge, please don't say anything.

 It never makes a difference, and then the teachers give us stink-eye during the school fairs.

 Well, if he's gonna get a haircut, Bart should at least have gotten a balloon with it.

 (groans) (grumbles) Well, anyway, Bart, you'll cheer up on our camping trip this weekend.

 What camping trip? The one you booked for us at Owl Haven.

 The one you have to reserve a year in advance.

 Oh, uh, you told me not to do it a year ago.

 Remember? I don't remember that.

 You're right.

 No one can be expected to remember something from a year ago.

 Certainly not me.

 Pass the gravy.

 (gasps) Don't tell me you didn't reserve a campsite.

 Labor Day is next weekend.

 There'll be nothing left.

 Hey, there's always room at Buzzard's Roost.

 Excuse me, but Buzzard's Roost is a converted parking lot.

 Excuse me, but grass is poking through.

 Why do I ever put you in charge LISA: Parking lot! of the littlest thing? HOMER: Poking through! (crying) LISA: Parking lot! HOMER: Poking through! My biggest sin is that I dare to hope.

 (crying) Oh, Marge, I can't stand it when you cry at dinner.

 The pork chops look traumatized.

 The mashed potatoes can't stand to watch.

 Even the children seem upset.

 So trust me, I will come through for you, baby.

 Not you.

 So what do you say, Marge? I want so much to believe you.

 And I want you to believe me, too.

 Isn't it great how much we agree? Looks like our blackboard has been defaced.

 Lucky for you, I can take a joke.

 (grunting) LISA: Hello? Hello? Is everything okay? MILHOUSE: Here's Millie! Excuse me, you ruined my report.

 Fine.

 You got an "A.

" LISA: Oh! Yippee! Fourth-grade "A"! You might fool some people, El Barto, but not me.

 (electrical buzzing) Now we're gonna learn about electricity.

 Hey, live wire.

 Come up here.

 Touch the generator.

 Even I think this is too far.

 Quiet, Smellson.

 It's sticking.

 (grunting) I just need to get to 60%.

 Milhouse, I'm gonna get back at Lassen.

 Now, The Hobbit taught us that every dragon has a chink in its armor.

 It also taught us that New Zealand's beautiful landscapes and attractive tax credits add up to a filmmaker's paradise.

 For more information, To find out Lassen's weakness, I hid a camera in the teachers' lounge.

 (grunting) Ach! Wrong order! You seem lonely and kind of weird.

 You left out "single.

" Mind if I heat up some goulash? Let's continue this online.

 I've created a fake Ms.

 Hoover profile.

 When Lassen friends her, we'll know everything about him.

 I don't know, Bart.

 You're lying about your identity? That's against the terms and conditions.

 We've all read the terms and conditions, Milhouse.

 Look, I really need a campsite.

 My wife is making sandwiches.

 Sorry, reservations are a year in advance.

 What about Mosquito Cove? Booked.

 Skunk Canyon? Booked every year since 2003.

 Ooh, how about the campsite where the guy in the hockey mask kills all the campers? Sir, that's a movie.

 HOMER: Hello? Hello? This is Homer Simpson.

 742 Evergreen Terrace.

 Looking for a place for my kids and me.

 And my pretty, pretty wife.

 You know, alarm code 3679.

 3679! So I hear you're getting back at Lassen.

 Maybe I am.

 So? You got to do it, man.

 He preys on the weak.

 Now, give me your lunch money.

 I'll take that.

 (whimpers) (cat screeches) Here's Lassen's profile.

 MILHOUSE: What the? BART: Tagged as Lassen? (groans) It says these were taken at Blazing Guy.

 What's Blazing Guy? Oh, that's convenient.

 Helloha.

 Do you want to make your home in a self-sustaining city that only exists a few days a year? One that combines nudity, dust storms, children and all-consuming fires? Then you, my bro or brah, are dreaming of Blazing Guy.

 On the last day, the chosen one, or Ignis, sets fire to the giant wooden Guy in a ritual dating back to 1986.

 The Blazing Guy Council of Elders, in conjunction with Duraflame, is very pleased to announce that this year's Ignis is Jack Lassen.

 (both gasp) So if we go there with a camera to film Lassen humiliating himself, I'll get revenge for him making me into this.

 (chuckles) I was trying to even it out.

 You're starting to look like your dad.

 No.

 I'm lucky.

 I look just like my mom.

 (Marge and Lisa grunting) Gosh, that was a hard sleeping bag to roll up.

 Those were your father's sweatpants.

 (sighs) Marge, I have a confession to make about this trip.

 (quietly): Dad, don't worry.

 I got you a place.

 Hmm? Once again, I've been saved from any consequences.

 It'll keep happening till one day I create a mess so enormous it can't be cleaned up.

 Thanks, boy.

  A-camping we will go   But where? I still don't know   A place that's filled with sun and sand   A desert steampunk Disneyland   Keep expectations low   Swing low, sweet chariot  Hmm.

 (Homer laughing) HOMER: Homer Simpson, I love you.

 Oh.

 (gasps) A world of anarchic free expression.

 Cars shaped like cupcakes! I'm home.

 I'm home.

 (gasps) No, no, no, don't blow me out, wise guy.

 Not in the mood.

 (groans) I'm not sure this campground is family-friendly.

 All camping is pointless.

 You drive hundreds of miles to shower and sleep in a place with no bathroom or beds.

 I guess what I'm trying to say is: Where's Maggie? (groans, screams) We brought Cheerios for you.

 Now, you know the wind does kick up here.

 Hope you went three feet down with your tent stakes.

 Uh, listen here, Desert Arnaz.

 Homer Simpson knows how to pitch a tent.

 Hey man, can I bum a tent? (groans) You seem stressed.

 Have some calming tea.

 Finally.

 A normal person.

 Ah.

 Thank you, Miss, um Calypso Self-Knowledge.

 Is that tea adulterated? Does that look like something I'd do? HOMER: Hey, Marge.

 We got a new tent from a guy who just O.

D.

'd.

 Aw, let me get a picture of that.

 (alarm whooping) (cell phone chimes) BOTH: Aw.

 I think Smitty's still inside.

 Oh, too bad he's missing this.

 So many musical choices.

 A brass band.

 Barbershop quintet? The human kazoo.

 Oh, a drum circle.

 (rhythmic drumming) (peppy tooting) Uh can I help you, freak? No.

 (plays a sad tune) BART: There he is.

 (gasps) His nipples are asymmetrical.

 This could ruin him.

 Milhouse, everyone here is a total freak.

 We have to find a way to completely humiliate Lassen.

 Get a picture of a restaurant check with no tip, put it online, say it was him.

 Kaboom, he's finished.

 Mmm.

 Oh.

 Suddenly this place doesn't seem so bad.

 This place is great.

 Just have to avoid these inseam-high cactuses.

 Hup, hup.

 D'oh! Oh.

 Are you Mr.

 Clean? (scoffs) Compared to the rest of these people, yeah.

 So give the Tooth Fairy my forwarding address, 'cause it's pretty loose.

 About time.

 It's the only phone.

 You don't count.

 Maybe we should just give up on Lassen.

 No.

 This Ignis thing is the biggest deal of his life.

 And I'm gonna wreck it.

 Because he scarred me forever.

 Hey, it grew back.

 A little better, even.

 So full and lush.

 Enough.

 Mmm.

 It's like someone ironed out all the wrinkles in my brain.

 (gasps) (upbeat tune plays) (wind whistling) Get in the tent.

 D'oh! Oh, you always save me, trombone elephant.

 (imitates elephant) Hmm.

 BART: Fire retardant? If Lassen can't light that thing, he'll be humiliated.

 What good is an Ignis who can't blaze the guy? I'm scared, Bart.

 And I am never scared.

 (gasps) Hideous.

 (loud beeping) These kids are gonna ruin the ceremony.

 It's too bad I'm just an illusion.

 Homie, you promised me an incredible camping trip, and I got one.

 Just like I planned.

 You got very lucky this time.

 Don't push it.

 I understand.

 I already signed up for this place next year.

 I gave my form and $200 cash to that dude.

 D'oh! (drums, saxophone, kazoo playing) Ignis, approach the Burning Man.

 I mean Blazing Guy.

 (crowd groaning) Get the job done.

 You're not helping.

 (crowd boos, hisses) Strip him of his nudity.

 (laughing) You.

 (both gasp) Maybe we won't have Blazing Guy, but we can still have blazing boy.

 What, uh (tooting) (screaming) Help me, desert weirdos.

 (both gasp) I'll take those.

 Beware the butterfly's sting.

 What the? (creaks) Form a human prison and hold him for five days.

 No.

 (grunts) Wait, how many days? (laughing) Hey, listen, we should probably get home.

 My dad forgot to bring water.

 (smacks tongue) Whoa.

 When will this tea get out of my system? (upbeat tune plays) Haw-haw! What the? According to this file from Blazing Guy Secret Security, your behavior was so egregious we can do something that we've never done before: fire a teacher.

 Hand in your red pen.

 Oh.

 Not gonna pass fingernail inspection tonight.

 So where do you go from here? A place where my talents will be appreciated.

 All right, lights out.

 You, too, freak.

 (groans) You hate him, too? With every fiber of what's left of my wretched soul.

 We should team up.

 I can get you out of here.

 A partner? Intriguing.

 Who gets to gut him like a little pot-bellied salmon? I assumed we'd take turns.

 No deal.

 Shh!   


                





                    			 (tires screeching) D'oh! (tires screeching) (grunts) (grunting) (snoring) (groans) (humming) (humming) Well, if ain't my next-door neighbor, King Toot.

 Moe.

 How many times I got to tell you not to throw your trash in my Dumpster? Oh, come on, Szyslak.

 I got to make space in the store for my new side business-- a tanning salon that secretly has cameras in the beds, which feeds into my Web site, That is registered.

 Yeah, sounds great.

 Maybe then you could afford to rent your own Dumpster.

 I like my current deal.

 Free.

 Of.

 Charge.

 (grunting) I'll eat your hair! You call that a testicle kick? (tires screech) All right, you two, break it up.

 Drive on, asphalt cowboy, or I'll squeeze his brain out like an edamame.

 Eh, uh, a what? Those beans you eat before your sushi comes.

 Oh, salt peas.

 I call them salt peas.

 Look, Officer, after 20 years of being neighbors, tempers sometimes flare up.

 Moe's a good guy.

 No, no, no, it's my fault.

 I'm a hothead.

 I ain't got no beef with you, Toot.

 (whispering): You better stay out of my Dumpster.

 I've also been stealing the catalogs out of your mailbox.

 (punching, instruments clattering) (grunting) (screaming) It's my Dumpster! (screaming continues) (both growling) And that's the terrifying tale of how the Quebec Nordiques became the Colorado Avalanche.

 Oh, no! King Toot's is closed! Dad, you're going to have to take me to the big box music store.

 Look at all these monstrosities.

 HOMER: Lisa, how many times have I told you to bow down to our corporate overlords? (Lisa groans) (doorbell dings) Hmm.

 Hmm.

 HOMER: It's like some kind of guitar central.

 Hmm.

 (groans) Hmm.

 Hmm.

 Midlife crisis at 12 o'clock.

 Mm-hmm.

 Okay, let me guess, dude.

 You're an axman; you're looking to score a new blade.

 Stig.

 (chuckles) You've got a name that's not a name.

 So what's your poison, bro? Les Paul? Straight up Gibson? No, no, no, classic Strat, am I right? Oh, I don't have what it takes to play guitar.

 I mean, I'm no Joe Walsh in the brains department.

 (chuckles) Who is? Look, you don't have the weak, womanly fingers of a guitar princess.

 You, my friend, have the muscular stumps of a bass man.

 Try this on.

 (note plays loudly) What the rock? (chuckles) Now that was a lick.

 I did a lick? Keep them coming.

 (notes repeating) Yes, now bob your head.

 Bob it, bob it, bob it.

 Dude, usually it takes years to learn such neck confidence.

 Now check this out.

   Oh, my God.

 I'm amazing.

 Dude, you're already one of the greatest bass players of all time.

 Okay.

 Now Oh, how are you set for stage lights? I'm not set at all.

 Ooh, what about gels? This is embarrassing to admit, Stig, but I haven't even thought about gels.

 (Marge humming) (bass playing loudly) (gasps) (screams) What is that racket?! Music! Beautiful music! What?! Beautiful music, baby.

 The bass guitar? This doesn't really seem like you.

 Sure it is.

 You know I've always loved laying things down.

 Grooves are just the latest.

 (groans) I feel a powerful connection to the history of famous bass players.

 Like what's-his-name from The Who.

 Or that guy from Led Zeppelin who wasn't Page, Plant or Bonham.

 Those are the only two I know for sure.

 It's so cool to have another musician in the family! Oh, yeah, and you know what the great thing is about music? It's so easy.

 Uh, well, to truly master an instrument you'll need years of So easy.

 (bass playing) (gasping) (siren wailing) (gasps) (groans) (gasps) Oh! Ooh! (groans) MARGE: I can't take it.

 All Homer does is play that stupid bass.

 Doink, doink, doink, doink, doink, doink, doink.

 You're not alone, Marge.

 A man gets older, has a career, a few kids, and suddenly there's a hole in his life that can only be filled by jamming.

 For my Julius, it was the drums.

 Timothy has that awful guitar.

 Kirk just loves his keyboards.

 I never knew so many women suffered from extramarital jamming.

 Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

 What if all the dads jammed together in a dad band?! That way they would play their horrible music in one garage at a time.

 Marge, you're a genius! This menu was right-- good things do happen at 'Zerz.

  'Zerz!  (cymbals clattering) I don't know, guys.

 I'm not sure I'm feeling this.

 The bass is kind of known for being a solo instrument.

 What were our wives thinking? We probably don't even like the same tunes.

 On the count of three, everyone say their favorite kind of music.

 One, two, three ALL: Hard-driving rock! (gasping) Dads, let's jam! (rock song playing) Garage bands rule! (gasps) I almost forgot the most important thing.

 (rock song playing) (song ends) Great practice, guys.

 What do you say we give it another six hours, then call it a day? APU: Excuse me, but my wife told me about your get-out-of-the-house band.

 And, uh, perhaps you need a singer? Oh, yeah, Apu, I'm sure you're a great singer.

 But the balance of the band is really delicate right now, and we're not really looking for a world music vibe.

 No disrespect to world music.

 I love world music.

 No, no, I will sing the classic power ballad "Hopin' for a Dream" by my favorite band from the 1980s, Sungazer.

 (clears throat) Okay, here we go.

  When I close my eyes   I wish that I could fantasize   Pull a dream right out of the air   Take a chance, turn it into a prayer.

  That sounds nothing like terrible, terrible world music.

 Why is your voice different when you sing? It is because of all the years I spent at the Kwik-E-Mart (rock song playing) where classic rock anthems were piped in on a never-ending loop.

 The endless repetition drove many clerks to madness.

 The only way to maintain my sanity was to sing along until it seemed like our voices were one.

  Hopin' for a dream   Hopin'   Focus like a laser beam   I'll keep fighting till I want something great   Hopin' for a dream.

  (song ends) Guys, are you feeling this? Are you feeling this? I'm feeling it.

 I'm definitely feeling it.

 I felt something earlier, but I was afraid to bring it up.

 I think we all felt something.

 We are more than just a garage band desperate to do anything other than hang out with our families.

 We are now a cover band.

 And we shall be called Covercraft.

 Because we play covers and this is our craft.

 And it sounds like Hovercraft.

 That was not my intent.

 Okay, Covercraft, hands in.

 Cover ALL: Craft! R-O-K-C.

 (carnival music playing) (instruments tuning) Okay, this crowd is about to experience the special magic of the cover band, the thrill of live music without the fear of hearing anything new.

 Hmm? (sighs) Apu, what's wrong? What if, what if I am no good? This is the Cabbage Festival, man.

 I-I don't know if I can face that crowd! (groans) Buddy, buddy.

 Think of it this way: you're not singing in front of all those people, you're alone at the Kwik-E-Mart in the middle of the night.

 You just wear this onstage, and everything will be fine.

 (gasps) My uniform! All alone at the Kwik-E-Mart.

    When I close my eyes   I wish that I could fantasize   Pull a dream right out of the air   Take a chance   Turn it into a prayer   Girl, you know I want to be the guy   With a hunger burning deep inside   Tonight I wish upon a falling star   To discover what my yearnings are  Everyone loves you, Dad.

 You could become a famous rock star! Well, son, I do have the talent.

 My mind is full of ideas for great songs I could write down the names of and then cover.

 But then I remember: I'm just a regular guy, jamming with my buds.

 Oh, sweetie.

 This band has brought out the best in you.

 Yeah, you really get that it's all about the music.

 Yep.

 It's all about the music.

 And it would take a pretty unforeseen development to change that.

 Pretty unforeseen Gentlemen, I think we've found what we're looking for.

 HOMER: Guys, I really need your honesty here.

 At the Squidport Senior Jamboree was I too in the pocket? (Covercraft members gasp) KIRK: Freddy Freeman, Shredder Stevens, Nick Delacourt and Peter D'Abbruzio-- you're four of the five guys from Sungazer! But where's your lead singer, Grant LeDavid? Uh, he passed away.

 How? (whispering) What kind of erotic asphyxiation? (whispering) Oh Apu, you're the only man on the entire Internet who's got the pure Sungazer sound.

 Will you be our new lead singer and join us on our stadium tour? Uh Oh! Ooh.

 I think I can answer for Apu.

 He's flattered, but the small-time success of Covercraft is all that any of us have ever wanted.

 Uh, actually, I Apu has a rich life here in Springfield: a store full of great products, a lovely him-type wife, and eight super kids: Anoop, Sandeep, Nabendu, Gheet, Pria, Uma, Poonam, Sashi Shut your mouth, I want to do it! I want to do it! I want to be a singer for a real rock band! SHREDDER STEVENS: Sun ALL: gazer! Gotta say, I'm kind of jealous of Apu getting a break like that.

 Not me.

 I'm nothing but happy that our friend is headed for fame and fortune.

 APU: Tonight we play Las Vegas-- and the theme of the casino is circus! Circus! Ha! (whimpers) I want his fame and fortune so much! Why must the Lords of Rock be so cruel?! (laughing) Sammy Hagar? You're not dead.

 Damn it! I told you those jalapeÃ±o poppers had too much breading! Sorry, SeÃ±or Hagar.

 Nah, nah, nah, it's cool, man.

 I went to rock star heaven.

 And there was this great back patio with this sweet fire pit.

 If you had the right wristband-- which I did.

 (laughs) News story in aisle three? Local clerk, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, is a dead ringer for a dead singer.

 He's living the rock star dream as front man for '80s chart-toppers Sungazer on their Last Final Hell Re-Freezes Over Ultimate Good-bye For Serious This Time Never Again Part Two of Question Mark Tour.

 Apu and the band appeared on Saturday Night Live as the punch line in a game show sketch.

 What's a game show? Something you make sketches about.

 KENT BROCKMAN: It looks like Apu won't be playing the Cabbage Festival ever again.

 Dad, you shouldn't be jealous of Apu.

 Remember, it's all about the music.

 I'm not jealous.

 I'm envious.

 Jealousy is when you worry someone will take what you have.

 Envy is wanting what someone else has.

 What I feel is envy.

 Hmm.

 Wow, he's right.

 You know what? Apu leaving is the best thing that ever happened to this band.

 We're gonna be like Genesis after Peter Gabriel left.

 You mean more popular but not as good? Phil Collins-era Genesis is not as good, huh? "No Reply at All," "Land of Confusion," "Throwing it All Away," "Illegal Alien," "I Can't Dance," and I'm sure I don't need to mention "Invisible Touch"! Hmph! (Covercraft plays) (grunts) You know, we really could use a new lead singer.

 You know, I've been known to sing a little.

 What? So you can also get famous and bail on us? You're out of the band! Well, you can't just kick him out.

 Oh, so you're sticking up for Yoko here? Looks like I've got another Yoko on my hands.

 How can there be two Yokos? Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! All you Yokos are out of the band! (grumbling) Are you okay? Do I sound okay? You sound great! Your licks are really juicy.

 They're not juicy.

 My licks are dry.

 Dry and scratchy like a cat's tongue.

 You didn't join a band to become famous like in Almost Famous.

 You loved playing music with your friends.

 That was enough to make you happy.

 Well, it's not enough anymore.

 When something great happens to one person, everyone else's life gets a little worse.

 Look it up, it's called physics.

 Apu is a good man.

 He sent over front row tickets and backstage passes to his show at the Costington Center.

 Oh, you mean he generously invited us to come watch him be a rock star? Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

 Your friend had a wonderful thing happen to him, and you are coming with us to share in his talent.

 I'll never have a per Diem.

 You don't know what a per Diem is.

 Still want one.

 Hmph.

 Hmph.

 Hmph.

 Apu wouldn't be able to sing a note if I didn't help him get over his stage fright with his Kwik-E-Mart shirt.

 (gasps) Backstage pass, you just became a payback rage pass.

 Look at all this rock star dressing room stuff.

 What a sellout.

 Cheese plate oh, sorry, cubed cheese plate.

 Lemon tea, probably for his throat.

 Mm-hmm! Let's see how he performs in front of all those people without his magic-people- performing-in-front-of shirt.

 (door opens, Homer gasps) But, Mr.

 Shredder, you promised me after we played my hometown I could have a day off.

 I also promised I'd kick heroin.

 Hmm? But the tour is so hard on my family.

 My octuplets are being raised by roadies and bodyguards.

 This is not proper.

 Look, Apu.

 For 25 years we wasted money on women, drugs and guitars with live fish inside.

 And now we want to keep it going.

 You signed a contract for a three-year, at union scale-- no per Diem.

 (gasps softly) You're in the band.

 Oh, well, I guess it's showtime.

 (gasps) Homer? I'm sorry, Apu.

 I thought you were living your dream life, so naturally I wanted to ruin it.

 But now I know things stink, so I'm okay with it.

 Oh, what is the point? I am trapped like a Kwik-E-Mart hot dog on a roller.

 Kwik-E-Mart hot dog, eh? You want every hot dog in the store? Every one? Okay - Yeah! - Yeah.

 - Oh!  -Yeah! FORUM ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, Tucks Medicated Pads presents Sungazer! (cheering) Yeah! All right! Uh, people? I am sorry to report that all the original members of the band have been struck down by a mysterious case of hot dog poisoning.

 (groaning) Rather than refund your money or reschedule the show, we have a surprise for you.

 Get ready to rock with a group that is truly all about the music-- Covercraft!    Hopin' for a dream   Hopin'   Focus like a laser beam   I'll keep fighting   Till I want something great   Hopin' for a dream   Hopin' for a dream  (audience cheering)  Hopin'   To someday, somehow have a goal   I'll keep fighting till I want something great   I'm hopin' for a dream   Hopin', hopin', hopin'   Hopin' for a dream   Hopin'   Dreams are great or so it seems   If I never find one I guess that's okay   I'm hopin' for a dream   Hopin', hopin', hopin'   Hopin' for a dream, oh  So there I am, on Easter Island, and the heads ask me to play them a song.

 I say, "Why me, heads? You've heard the music of the universe itself.

" And they say, "Sammy, your stuff rocks just a little harder.

" That's when I wake up.

 I'm in the Springfield Elementary parking lot, doing a buck fifty-five in my Ferrari 512 Boxer.

 I was cornering so hard, I blacked out from the Gs, man.

 They say I ran over the groundskeeper.

 Probably get life in prison.

 But I got a plan to escape, using only this harmonica and some guitar picks with my face on 'em.

 Who's with me on this? (Hagar laughing)   


                





                    			 (bellowing) Yee-haw-ho-ho! (school bell ringing) (bears growling) (whistle blows) (playing "Jingle Bells") (playing bluesy riff)   (growls) (snarling) (squawking) (cats yowling) (Cat Lady jabbering) D'oh! (bicycle bell jingling) (grunts) BART: Ay, caramba! (groans) Carrot.

 (humming) You are about to see the worst half-hour of television ever.

 All righty then.

   Okay, R3, let's serve up some soup.

 (whistling) May the sauce be with you.

 Oh, since when is soup sauce? This is so non-canonical.

 You have every right to be furious.

 Oh, it's as bad as I remembered, and I haven't watched it since yesterday.

 Horrible, yet enthralling.

 Hooray! A card from Dr.

 Hibbert.

 (gasps) Phew.

 Oh.

 (bird squawks) I'll be right home, honey.

 I just got to lock down the reactor for the evening.

 Tight as a drum.

 See you soon.

 Bart, hold the ladder still! (gasps) (grunts) Oh! Wish Homer was here.

 Simpson! (gasps) Mr.

 Scrooge! Time for your holiday gift.

 Ooh! In your name, a donation has been made (groans) to the Salvation Army.

 (groans) Also, you will be visited by three spirits tonight.

 No, wait.

 That's my schedule.

 Smithers, We need to cancel the 10:30 spirit.

 Yes, sir.

 (Marge humming) MARGE: Hello.

 HOMER: Heading home, baby.

 Nothing's gonna stop me now.

 (shrieks) (groaning) Maybe a drink will help me with my driving.

 Man, those things go off quick.

  Yo.

  (guitar plays country melody) (metal guitar plays)  Ah!  VIN SCULLY: and the baseball exclaimed as it flew out of sight, this ballpark is shorter in left field than right.

 Martinez swings and misses.

 Yes! I'm recording this during a game.

 Since the United States government declares this man to be Santa Claus, this court will not dispute it.

 Few people know that verdict was overturned in the sequel.

 (chuckles) I better be heading home to my family.

 Enjoy your evening with your wonderful uh neon sign.

 Yeah, last year I broke it just so the repairman would come.

 But I'll be fine.

 Hey, um, you gonna be okay? Oh, yeah, yeah.

 Super! (crying) It's just that you know, I lost my ma at Christmas.

 (sighs) She took me to a mall, and I never saw her again.

 But I'll never forget that image of her bolting for the parking lot.

 Okay, okay.

 I'll stay for one beer.

 Oh, great, great.

 But don't do it out of pity.

 Pity! Pity! Have pity! Look, I'm wrapped around your leg here! Please! Please! Please! But I promised Marge.

 Now I'm sitting on your shoulders! Please! Okay, okay! (Homer groans) (grunts) Mom, where's Dad? I don't know.

 Aw, it's Christmas Eve, man! We do not want to set a precedent for fat guys being late tonight! (grunts)  Silent night   Holy night  (laughs) I'm happy on Christmas Eve.

 And for once it's not 'cause some drunk left a wallet on his stool.

 Uh-oh, this is starting to hurt.

 (grunts) And now, Homer, it's only fair that I give yous a gift.

 I'm gonna set the clock in the bar to the correct time.

 HOMER: Hey, what the (gasps) I am so late! Whoa, whoa.

 It's the night before Christmas! Stop stirring, you! (grunts) (ticking) One night.

 The one night of the year I want Homer home with his family, and he can't even do that.

 Christmas is a great time to dump him.

 If you do it now, you won't have to watch the Super Bowl.

 (tires squealing, car door closing) Homer Simpson! (gasps) I never thought I'd say this to someone I cared for, much less my husband, but I'm saying it now.

 I don't want you here on Christmas! Marge, think about what you're saying.

 It's Sir Isaac Newton's birthday.

 Out now! Yeah? Well, good luck assembling all those toys without me! We already did it.

 (shrieks) The ghost of Marge Future! HOMER: She'll forgive me.

 MARGE: Should I forgive him? HOMER: Especially this time.

 MARGE: Maybe not this time.

 HOMER: I mean it's Christmas.

 MARGE: With his marriage in this much trouble, he's got a lot of thinking to do.

 HOMER: I wonder if there's birds on the moon.

 (sobbing): I miss Marge.

 WIGGUM: I wonder if Lou suspects that I was his Secret Santa.

 LOU: What kind of a cheapskate gives you one corncob holder for Christmas? (chuckles) Moe, what are you doing?  Good King Wenceslas looked out   On the feast  JAPANESE MALE VOICE: Voice too poor for karaoke.

 Shutting down.

 Bye now.

 Oh, my God.

 Santa brought me just what I asked for! (laughs) Hmm.

 "239.

" Who's he fooling? Hmm Hmm.

 Hmm! Mm-hmm.

 Hey, pal.

 Can't believe you have to work Christmas Eve.

 Well, if you're here for a last minute gift, we have a cell phone holder that fits no cell phone made after 2002.

 And, uh, Kwik-E-Nog.

 Nog stands for "Not Okayed by Government.

" Maybe Marge would forgive me if I won the lotto.

 Give me a scratcher.

 D'oh! Give me another one.

 (groans) D'oh! Give me another one.

 (groans) D'oh! Give me another one.

 (groans) D'oh! Give me another one.

 (groans) D'oh! Give me another one.

 Oh please, stop! Stop it! My religion prohibits me from taking advantage of a fool more than ten times.

 This thing basically has no winners.

 Yeah, but doesn't the money goes to schools? You have been to our schools.

 What do you think? Welcome to Bring Us Your Toilet Paper night.

 Don't worry, none goes to Willie.

 Don't need it.

 I got me Starbucks napkins! You know, ironically, in India, they did use the money for schools and they had fantastic results.

 Aw, thanks for your honesty, Apu.

 Is there any other product in the store you'd like to warn me about? Well, uh those hot dogs began life as Twinkies.

 (sizzling) Wow.

 (pop, crackling) (groans) Christmas Eve.

 The one night a kid wants to go to sleep is the one night he can't.

 I can't have another cocoa.

 My pee is starting to smell like a ski chalet.

 (door opens) Oh, thank God you're here.

 I need to get to sleep.

 Tell me the story of jazz again.

 Well, the story of jazz starts with the tresillo, the most prevalent duple-pulse rhythmic cell in sub-Saharan African music.

 But the rest will have to wait.

 Bart, Bart, I hear Mom sobbing.

 And I don't know where Dad is.

 If it helps, I made you a card.

 Bart, this is the year I've got to nail Christmas.

 I don't want to be a jaded ten-year-old like you! Ah, yes.

 I remember Christmas Eve when I was eight.

 MARGE: Why do you always wait till the last minute to put up the lights? HOMER: I don't want to ruin the magic.

 And I certainly Aah! (gurgling) Next year this is your job.

 (electrical crackling) (grunting) (grunting) Ooh! (grunting) Hmm, they say a boy never gets over seeing his dad in a Santa suit getting hanged and electrocuted on Christmas Eve.

 I'll help you, kid.

 (sighs heavily) Mom, I'm just a kid, but I say if Dad isn't here Christmas morning, that's the kind of thing families never recover from.

 Hmm.

 Lisa, sweetie, I'm tired of being a pushover.

 You're not a pushover.

 You can't smoke.

 Just chewing on the wood.

 Okay then.

 (clattering) (groans) Eh, how you doing there? Uh, your front door was locked, So, uh, rather than call or knock, I, uh, came down your chimbley there.

 (coughs) Moe Szyslak, you didn't climb down our chimney just to say "Merry Christmas.

" (coughing) (clears throat) Midge, it's one minute till Christmas, and if I'm ever gonna be a good guy, it's now.

 All right, here I go.

 I'm the one that kept Homer from coming home, 'cause, uh, well, I was lonely.

 (gasps) Yeah, that's right-- me, Mr.

 Party Pants.

 So, uh, so don't hold it against Homer, eh? Oh, my poor Homie.

 This is what I was hoping for.

 For it not to have been completely his fault.

 Thank you, Moe.

 (mumbling): Huh? I'm sorry, Marge, I'm sorry, but it was Christmas, and we were under the mistletoe.

 That's lettuce caught in a spider's web.

 All right.

 I've got to call Homer.

 (buzzing) (beeps) D'oh! What gives? Don't you get Showtime Extreme? (groans) No answer.

 Let's go find your father.

 What? I never give up hope.

 Neither do I.

 Even the anchor store's closed.

 ("Someday at Christmas" plays)  Someday at Christmas   Men won't be boys   Playing with bombs   Like kids play with toys   One warm December our hearts will see   A world where men are free   Mm   Someday at Christmas  Any uplifting holiday movies? Well, let's see.

 We've got a film about a nutty professor Ooh.

 D'oh! Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill Yeah? in a concentration camp drama.

 D'oh! And a cute model Ooh! airplane that lost its propeller.

 Um, I guess I'll take the concentration camp one.

 And a Merry Christmas to you, sir.

   (sighs) Well, if I got to spend Christmas Eve alone, at least no one will see me.

 Hey-ya, Homer! (barking) Ah, just 'cause you're here shouldn't make you sad.

 This is my 17th Christmas alone in a movie theater.

 This is my family.

 The guy with the smelly pants, the lady that carries empty cans in a PBS tote bag.

 Ugh, what if I left now and gave you guys my popcorn and soda? (cat meows) Wow, Homer, you have a very generous side.

 Can I borrow, like, $10,000? Flanders? What are you doing here? Christmas is my busy season.

 Sold three pairs of scissors this month.

 Two came back.

 Say, Flanders, with all the hard luck you've had, how do you stay so happy? And don't say "Jesus.

" Well, sir, our good Lord and my boys are all I've really got.

 All Edna left me was wonderful memories and some ungraded papers, which I'm still working my way through.

 (sniffles) Flanders, are you crying? Ah, just snowflakes on my mustache.

 Listen, could I buy a left-handed, uh I don't know, eyelash curler? Sure, but y-your eyelashes are long and luxurious already.

 Are you just buying this to be nice? Uh, maybe.

 Oh, Homer, unto us this day, a neighbor is born.

 But why? Because jerk-ass Homer has become ass-jerk Homer.

 Well, that curled my lashes, but good for you.

 (chuckles) You're all right, stupid Flanders.

 You're all right.

 Well, this is a whole new relationship for us.

 We'll be friends in this life and the next.

 HOMER: Whoa, he's getting serious.

 Is this what I really want? (whimpering) My best friend is a great runner.

 I made everyone happy but me.

 Some Christmas.

 (sobbing): Feliz navidad.

 (wind whistling) (vehicle approaching, tires screeching) Abe Simpson, please.

 Visitor for Abe Simpson.

 You came! You came to see me! (Bart grunting) Aw! Easter came early this year.

 I thought we were just gonna ask if he'd seen Homer.

 I'm afraid we've awoken a needy giant.

 Visitors! Let's brew some weak tea and talk about the good ol' days! Make them turn the TV to CBS! ("Hark! The Herald Angels Sing" plays) (electrical crackling) Well, with all that you folks have experienced, I think we could enjoy listening to a little of your wisdom.

 The problem with Puerto Ricans is No casual racism.

 (Homer snoring) (muttering) What the? The Nutcracker.

 Every child's favorite Christmas character.

 Is this a dream? Not a dream.

 I work at the mall.

 And it's closed, so scram.

 Man, you are a nutcracker.

 But I've learned something tonight-- you know how everyone hates being with their family on Christmas? Uh-huh.

 Well, being without them is worse.

 Can you find it in your wooden heart to give me a break? All right, listen, pal, uh you want to go to a party? (dance music plays) What are you doing here? Halloween merchandise goes on sale December 26, man.

 ("O Holy Night" plays) Well, he's not in the neon sign store.

 Lady, buy a sign or go home.

 I'm sorry.

 I'm trying to find my husband, and nothing's open.

 Well, there is a party here.

 Hey, is your husband into people dressed like food? Where is this party?! (electrical crackling)   Oh, my God.

 Is that girl really doing that?! Mm, load-bearing wall.

 (whoops) (moans) Ho, ho, ho! This party's great, but all I wish is that I was drinking a beer with my kids right now.

 MARGE: Homer? Hmm?! Homie, I'm your present tonight.

 And the present is that I'm not gonna always assume that you screwed up.

 Because I realize maybe there's a good explanation for what you do.

 Or a crazy one that's pretty entertaining.

 Oh, Marge, you found me! You always find me.

 Now we just have to find your car in the mall parking lot.

 I thought I had one of those chirping keys.

 Oh, well, I've been faking the noise.

 'Cause you deserve the best.

 (imitates car chirp) You didn't have to do that.

 I love you just the same.

 (imitates car chirp) (moaning) Thank you magical creatures of the mall! You have all taught me a Christmas message I'll never forget-- the place to get drunk is at home.

 ("Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" plays) All right, I'm sick of waiting.

 Bart, you know you can't open a present till Mom and Dad wake up.

 (scoffs) It's 9:10 a.

m.

 I know what they're doing-- they're up in bed watching the re-broadcast of the Hollywood Christmas Parade.

 Oops, my finger slipped.

 Oops! So did mine.

 (laughing) BART: Oh, I got a baseball glove.

 LISA: I got a chemistry set.

 BART: I want yours.

 GOD: Merry Christmas, son.

 Uh, don't you mean "Happy Birthday"? GOD: It's two presents.

 Um, walkie-talkies don't count as two presents.

 God.

 I mean, you.

 JESUS: Idiot.

 Behold, our miracle of birth.

 Each birth is followed by another birth just seconds later.

 (grunting) What the?! This isn't Halloween.

 Shh!   


                





                    			 Whoa! (tires screeching) D'oh! (tires screeching) (grunts) (piano playing softly) (static, explosion) And in other news (all sigh happily) BOTH: Are we there yet? Are we there yet? No.

 Are we there yet? No! Are we there yet? I said no! Are we there yet? What's wrong with your ears? Are we there yet? Look out the window! Are we there yet? We're not there! Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Okay.

 We're there.

 Finally.

 Are we there yet? Huh? Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Damn technology! Are we there yet? Turn it off! We did.

 This is us.

 Are we there yet? Are we there yet? (anguished scream) (laughter) HOMER: Ooh, a spot.

 Okay, remember we're parked in the "Ethnic Princess" section.

 (horn honking) HOMER: Don't worry, this time I'm gonna write down where I parked.

 (crowd shouting) (screams) Look! I see land! (cheering) Mama! We made it! Mama? No! You planted that on me, man! (screaming) Sorry.

 No outside pacifiers.

 Fine, but I'm not paying for the insurance.

 Oh, what the hell? Give me the insurance.

 The first ride we go on will be for you.

 (bluegrass music playing) BART: Oh, geez! (mechanical whirring) Purchased for $4 billion, I was.

 Yet still hoodie ragged, wear I do, this.

 Pirates of the Caribbean! Huh? They revamped this ride because of massive complaints from two people.

  No means no   We know now   No means no   We know now  (high-pitched): Ha-ha! My cartoons weren't good, they were just first! ALL: Ooh! Not enough ketchup.

 (groans) We've been here six hours and the coolest thing we've done is stand in the Cool Zone.

 ANNOUNCER: The Cool Zone is beyond maximum capacity.

 Disperse, disperse.

 (crowd grumbling) (screaming) (sighing happily) How about that one? (excited shouting) (screaming) Ooh, I don't like the end sounds on that.

 ANNOUNCER: By 1994, we'll have drive-in theaters on Neptune! Life magazine will be (slowly): And your telegrams will be delivered by jetpa Well, that's it.

 We've visited every section including Churro County, Toonton Abbey, but you know what we haven't had here? I'll tell you: fun.

 The kind of fun attractive families have in commercials.

 Hey, Dad, I see a ride that actually looks decent.

 I just want to sit down, but the line for the bench is too long.

 No, look, it's a ride that just opened and no one's there.

 Dad, I don't know about this.

 It's not on the park map.

 Lisa, those maps were drawn by the first explorers of this theme park, hundreds of years ago.

 Let's go.

 KANG: Assume a sitting position.

 KODOS: One seat per human.

 Come on, start this thing! I'm not impressed.

 This is so fake.

 HOMER: Uh-oh.

 ALL: Ooh! We've left Earth's atmosphere.

 Prove it.

 (squeals) BART AND LISA: Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Welcome, humans.

 There is nothing to fear.

 I am Kang the Abductor.

 What the? This isn't Halloween.

 Are we truly in space? And if so, why? All will be revealed in time, unsuspecting humans.

 Why does the last thing you say sound so ominous? It's just the way we speak, easily reassured fool.

 (sighing happily) Oh! Yeah, that's good.

 We shall now attend to the complex calculations of hyperspace.

 (chuckling) Hey, Captain Squid! If you really want to be nice to us, how about some snacks? Whatever you say shall materialize.

 Potato chips.

 ("Blue Danube Waltz" playing) D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! Stupid kid, you ruin every trip! Hokey Smokes! I can't survive in these conditions! Whoa! (sighs) Hmm! (grunts) Hmm! (laughs) Homer, please.

 That's creeping me out.

 D'oh! (chuckles) Let me just There you are, just like new, not a freak of nature.

 Wow, look at all these knobs and buttons.

 They are clearly a superior race.

 But maybe that means they'll be nice to us.

 You mean like Europeans were to the Native Americans? Or the Belgians were to the Congo? That's right.

 Pick the only two times in history where things got messy.

 We have begun our descent to our home planet.

 Please turn off all portable electronic devices.

 Who's gonna stop me? Perhaps you haven't noticed the air marshal.

 Have your cups lost their suck? Slipped on some drool? Larry H.

 Zeeblezorp will have you rolling in space credits.

 Wow.

 This place is completely alien, but everything's in English.

 Just like Canada.

 Can I turn my phone on? KODOS: Not yet.

 Now what? I say we take this bucket home! To Earth! (engine not starting) Come on.

 Come on, you son of a Thanks for flooding it.

 (engine not starting) (groans) Take these pills, and you can breathe our atmosphere.

 Are there any side effects? Yes, I'm afraid you will never develop tentacles.

 (groans) Behold the wonders of our world.

 Purple landscape, purple trees.

 Yeah, you really went with the purple theme.

 We can change it at will.

 Now look upward to see our seven suns.

 (gasps) So, you use a lot of solar energy? We have federal rebates for the panels, but few take advantage of them.

 Now we shall show you the sacred mysteries of our life cycle.

 Behold, our miracle of birth.

 Each birth is followed by another birth just seconds later.

 (groans) (all groaning) And finally, a sadder slice of our lives.

 Gaze upon the dead being dumped into a river of their own drool.

 (bagpipes playing) Farewell, dear friends, on your sacred journey to the chopper-upper.

 Aw.

 Why are you sharing all this with us? Because we want you to fully appreciate the planet that you will never leave! (gasping) Wait, are you telling me we're prisoners in this cage? Okay, take five.

 (dissonant bagpipe chord) (screeching) Don't look at them.

 You can see those birds any time.

 (meows) (screaming) Right hand red! Aah! I win.

 I think.

 (grunts) Would you like one of our toys? Thanks.

 Why did you do that? I thought it was a ball.

 That is the one thing it can never be.

 (plays instrument out of tune) Don't be alarmed.

 I am a trained humanologist.

 Let me just check your heart.

 All well and good.

 You obviously exercise.

 (nasally): See, Marge? Anything you need? Perhaps you'd care to have your ink gland expressed.

 You're the doctor.

 Homer! You have to stop dropping your pants for everyone who claims they're a doctor.

 Fine.

 Now, I am here to complete your knowledge of our great and generous species.

 Are you the guy that talks nice before they kill us? Eh, we'll come back to that.

 As young thinglings, we are schooled in the wisdom of the universe.

 Physics, mathematics, FORTRAN the greatest of the programming languages! And now the part that is difficult to tell you.

 At the end of a life well-lived, there is one final ritual.

 We must eat one of you.

 (all gasp) But we'll let you have the fun of picking which one.

 (laughs) There's only one fair solution.

 We have to put it to a vote.

 Before we vote, I'd just like to point out in Sophie's Choice, she saved the boy.

 (humming a tune) This isn't a happy thing! Here you go.

 Okay.

 What the?! D'oh! Well, we haven't heard from Maggie yet.

 Now, what the? (scoffs) Gibberish, pure gibberish.

 You're the last vote, Homie.

 (groaning) 'Tis a far, far better thing I do than I have ever done before.

 Hey, look, Maggie made you a farewell card.

 That kid's got talent, but come on! Now do you see why I'm a vegetarian, Dad? I get it, Lisa.

 I finally get it.

 You do get a last meal.

 I'd like rabbit, lots of rabbit.

 Ah.

 Welcome to the World Series of Chomping.

 This annual consumption ritual is brought to you by scalp salt.

 From the same wonderful folks who make elbow pepper and groin gravy.

 Here comes sacrifice Homer Simpson.

 His hobbies include sitting, lying down, and reaching for things without success.

 Come on, folks, let's put your eyelids together! (eyelids clapping) Doesn't your culture say anything about mercy? Madam, you are speaking to the kindest and gentlest of us all.

 Let's see: skull crusher, skin peeler, eyeball popper, scream collector (gasps) Got it.

 Our elder Klaunax has been chosen for our ceremonial first bite, after which Homer Simpson will be dipped into a spicy cheese fondue.

 "Fondue"? Welcome to a faculty dinner party in 1979.

 Silence! And celebrate the Solstice of Slobbering to the sounds of the Rigel 7 Children's Choir.

  Tasty creature   We salute you  (all slurp)  For your juicy   Sacrifice.

  (all slurp) (groaning) (laughing) (grunting) A transporter beam! Someone is trying to steal our sacrifice.

 Yes! This mysterious tube can only lead to somewhere good.

 So long, you stupid slobbering What the?! (grunting) And away we go! (sighs) Way to go, George Mucus.

 The fattest, stupidest man on Earth slipped right through your sticky tentacles.

 Why, you little! What is this baffling construct? It's called a knot.

 A not what? "Knot" with a "K.

" Ks are silent? Really? I've been saying kitchen.

 That's correct.

 BOTH: Huh? (Homer gasps) MALE: Do not fear.

 You are among friends.

 We are the resistance.

 We don't believe in the barbaric consumption of other species.

 So, what do you eat-- space broccoli? Space broccoli has the most advanced feelings of any creature in the universe.

 I stepped on a piece once, and it cried for six years.

 Frankly, they are a little full of themselves.

 Who are you talking about? Um, earth broccoli.

 Yeah, I hate those guys.

 They think they're so big.

 Let's go, Homer.

 Where are you taking me? You are about to behold the secret rebel base.

   Aah! Whee! Yeah! Why are they dancing? Shouldn't they be making weapons? This is excellent training for the party we will throw when our rebellion succeeds.

 (music stops) MALE: Oh, turn the music back on.

 In a minute! First, noble human Homer Simpson will explain his primitive yet beautiful culture.

 (bird caws) But perhaps Earth's greatest achievement is moon rocks.

 Oh, radio.

 (all oohing) Truly a species with much to offer.

 MALE: Seriously? Are we listening to the same guy? Silence! Homer, we will get you back to Earth.

 What about my family? Why do you care? It's just your sex mate and spermlings.

 "Sex mate"? (laughs) Clearly you've never been married.

 But it's great, I'm telling you.

 Unfortunately, we only had the means to build the spaceship for one.

 We spent most of our money on the party.

 Well, it is a great party.

 The pod is equipped to fulfill your deepest desires.

 Just concentrate.

 Suddenly, this trip has gotten interesting.

 (gasps) What the?! Oh, who am I kidding? I couldn't enjoy calorie one without my family.

 I'm going back to save them! Aw, if I could just live inside that head, so full of noble thoughts.

 (growls, grunting) The golden rule states if the chosen one escapes, his family is eaten as forfeit.

 What do your rules say now? That all will be eaten.

 D'oh! This system is really rigged against us.

 (Bart and Marge groan) You forgot to glaze me.

 No, I didn't.

 You licked it off! I think somebody's afraid to admit he's out of glaze.

 (groans) Glaze, please.

 (growls) Make way for the queen! I shall take the first bite.

 It is quite an honor.

 (whimpering) What's that? Part of your magnificent behind.

 We sliced it off when you were sleeping.

 It does look delicious.

 (gasps) What is it, my queen? This ass is most disagreeable.

 (gurgles) The creatures are composed of completely indigestible toxins.

 These humans have been poisoned by their unhealthy fast-food diet.

 Um, are you sure you don't want to try me again? You? Your lunches of hummus and rice cakes combine in your stomach to form formaldehyde and animal fat.

 Really? But I thought You'd be better off chewing tobacco like the boy.

 What?! Dad said I could try it.

 Homer! Don't you people realize your queen is dying? I'm afraid the lardo speaks the truth, Your Majesty.

 It's all right.

 I have seen many glories and have only one regret.

 That my breasts aren't bigger.

 I don't see any breasts.

 And those will be the last words I ever hear.

 (grunts) Useless humans! We will send you back to your planet, and your memories will fade.

 So, it will be as if none of this ever happened! Captain's log, stardate 65848.

 After successfully conquering the Rigelians Right, "conquering.

" Well, at least Maggie can fly us home.

 Thank God it's just like her busy box.

 Well, I guess we've learned that of all the countless planets in the universe, we have evolved into the most inedible species.

 Like three-bean salad at a barbecue, we will remain untouched.

 We're receiving a transmission from an unknown source.

 Hey, I finally tracked you down! My oatmeal's gone cold.

 Can't believe you're retiring.

 Yup, it's time for the gold watch.

 Thank you.

 You're free to go.

 (clocks ticking) Good old Don.

 We sure will miss your your, um, uh What did you do again? Safety inspector, 7-G.

 But wait a minute.

 That's my job.

 Yes, of course it is.

 There are two of us, and I've been covering for you all these years.

 That would explain a lot.

 But why did you do it? I felt there was something special in you.

 It's like rooting for the Cubs.

 You keep thinking they'll make it, and then you realize they never, ever will.

 (whimpers) But now, you won't have me to protect you.

 Oh, please.

 All I'm asking you to do is stay 21 more year Too late.

 I'm gone.

 If I was Fred Flintstone, I'd be at the end of the dinosaur's tail.

 (whimpering): Oh, it's such a big ass.

 (tires screeching) (sighs) How was your day? Oh, stressful.

 You see how loose my tie is? Mah! For the first time, I actually have to do my job! Oh, sweetie.

 (groans) And, Marge, I got this weird new feeling in my stomach-- a little sour and a little sick.

 There's a Yiddish word for it-- shpilkes.

 They have a lot of funny words for not so funny things.

 (crow caws) Hey, Homer, Carl and I are gonna see if we can sneak out of the men's room without setting off the automatic toilets.

 Ninja-style.

 Look, I don't have time for childish games.

 If I don't do my job, atoms go boom.

 Simpson, I want a full plant status report at 5:00.

 Yes, sir.

 Yes, sir.

 Can I get a 4:55 wakeup call? No! Oh.

 (toilet flushing) Damn it! (birds singing) I thought we weren't allowed to do homework at the table.

 It's called a double standard, one of the bedrocks of parenting? You've been working so hard lately.

 Maybe you should take a break.

 No.

 Marge, if I lose my job in this economy, it's a death sentence.

 Well, I guess as a fallback, I could direct films, like Angelina Jolie.

 How many properties do we have an option on? None.

 What?! When were you gonna tell me?! Uh, uh When? (keyboard keys clicking) Homie, a workaholic is probably your best aholic ever, but you need to relax, so, I got us all tickets to see the circus on Saturday.

 The circus? Hmm.

 I haven't been to the circus since I was a kid.

   (yelling, thudding, crowd gasping) Son, look over there.

 (trumpeting) Uh, I mean look over there.

 Ten bucks a cone?! Look back at the elephant.

 (laughs) Okay, Marge, we can go to the circus.

 And maybe I can finally find out why a man would think a stool is a proper defense against a lion.

 Damn it! This circus Wi-Fi is a joke! Oh, come on! I thought you were going to try to relax.

 How can anyone relax when they made us park in stacked parking? I knew he wasn't gonna like the stacked parking.

 What kind of insane parking system is designed so you're blocked in by everyone that arrived after you? (clack) The early bird gets the shaft! Shh! Shh!   (cheering and crowd chatter) Oh, my God.

 What if all those clowns are parked in the same lot as us?! Maybe there's better Wi-Fi in the freak tent.

 Mah.

 Excuse me.

 Pardon me.

 (phone ringing) What the hell?! Oh, finally.

 The business call I've been waiting for.

 Hello, this (groans) Come on, kids.

 There's nothing you'd be interested in here.

 (snapping) Uh, uh Hey! Hey, uh they'll grow back.

 Oh, Homer, I have to use the Porta Potti.

 Oh, for gah Now? Do you have to? No woman uses one of these by choice.

 (groaning) Hey, Dad, since we got to wait, can't we please see an act? Ugh.

 Fine, but I'll be amazed if I'm astounded.

 Thereby proving Zorn's Lemma.

 Give me my damn husband back! Dang, look at all them hobo signs! My head bone hurts.

 Aah.

 (applause and chatter) I need a new volunteer.

 How about you, sir? (gasps) Hey, is that time right? I have a deadline in an hour and a half.

 You know, Dad, studies show being hypnotized makes you more efficient.

 Mm, oh, okay.

 Is that true? Mah.

 I just wanted to see him cluck like a chicken.

 (laughs) Now, we've never met, have we, sir? Ooh, patter.

 Do you have any children? No, but we're having fun trying.

 (laughs) Wait.

 I mean three.

 When I snap my fingers, you shall be ten years old.

 Look, can we get to the point? I'm stack parked.

 Did you hear me? Stack You are ten years old! No, I'm not.

 Yes, you are.

 No, I'm not.

 Yes, you are.

 No, I'm not.

 Yes, you are! Yes, you are.

 No, yes, yes, you are.

 Yes, you are.

 Look, I said you are.

 Yeah, and you are, too.

 Only a ten-year-old boy could be this annoying! (applause, gasping, crowd chatter) I'm not convinced.

 I know you are, but what am I? Infinity plus one.

 Jinx! Only the coolest kid ever could think of that.

 Good golly, Sven Golly, you did it! Sven Golly, born Svenjamin Golly, you are under arrest for mesmerizing the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to induct Kiss.

 You are wanted by the police, by which I mean Sting, Andy Summers, uh Hey, is it Is is getting hot in here? Oh, not again.

 Mom, Dad's been hypnotized to think he was ten.

 Ah.

 (gasps) Hmm.

 (rhythmic thudding) Now I'm gonna test just how deeply Homer's mind has been effected.

 Take a sip of this, young man.

 (coughing) Ew! Gross! What did you give him? Beer.

 (all gasp) This hypnotism is strong.

 Dinner theater strong.

 My husband can't really think he's ten.

 I'm saying, he so desperately needs to believe he's ten, that only the original hypnotist who did this can undo the trance without risking permanent damage to Homer's psyche.

 (laughs) (in high-pitched voice): Hey, oh, help me! Dear God.

 Psych! Oops.

 So, what do we do? Do not force the truth.

 For now, just treat Homer just as you would a regular ten-year-old boy.

 Can he be nine so I can beat him up? No, I'm afraid not.

 The rules of hypnotism are inflexible.

 Then can we get pizza on the way home? Ask for boogers on Bart's half.

 (laughs) Good one.

 Booger pizza.

 You better pray they find that hypnotist, Marge.

 HOMER: Get the ball, boy! Come on.

 (squeaking) Go get it, boy! (barking) Go get it, boy.

 (whines) Go get it, boy! (snarls, barking) Hey! Ow! Ow! I thought you were my best friend.

 (barking) Ooh! Ow-Ow! So, where is he gonna sleep? Well, I guess it'll have to be in Bart's room.

 Oh.

 And I thought when Homer cut off his thumb was bad.

 Um, Mrs.

 Simpson? Aah! (laughing) MARGE: Oh! (snoring) (snoring) (groans) Hey? What? Who? Homer, can't you sleep with Mom? I'd be too nervous.

 Have you noticed that she's kind of hot? Gross! Weird! Complicated! Go to sleep.

 (grumbles) I really do miss my Homie this time of night.

 Hmm.

 Hmm.

 Hmm.

 Mm-hmm.

 We're gonna have a lot of mittens this winter.

 (birds singing) Aw, if I'm gonna get through this day, I better Irish up my coffee.

 I'm ready to go to school.

 Homer, you're not going to school.

 I'm not? Cool! Am I sick? 'Cause if I'm sick, I get to stay home and make s'mores.

 All I need is graham crackers, chocolate, marshmallows, sticks, fire Did I say graham crackers? Chocolate, marshmallows, sticks, fire Oops! My homework.

 Fine, you can go to school.

 Yo, this is tunnel tag.

 When you're tagged, you have to spread your legs and freeze.

 Guess I chose the wrong day to wear culottes.

 Every day's the wrong day to wear culottes.

 You're it! (kids laughing, clamoring) (kids gasp) Can I play? Oh, God, no.

 If Milhouse can play, anyone can play.

 Once again, I'm the lower bound.

 You're it! (kids laughing, clamoring) Is that a grown man going between the children's legs? Well, there's nothing in the rule book against it.

 It's on page one of the rule book! That's where I doodle.

 It's a comic strip I do called Bumble and Grumble.

 Grumble likes to yell, but deep down he loves Bumble like a son.

 No, he doesn't.

 HOMER: I'm beat.

 (yawns) Today was fun.

 Yeah.

 Listen, Homer, do you ever think about what you want to do when you're grown up? I'll eat in bed.

 Not just snacks, messy stuff like lasagna.

 Oh, and the TV would be on.

 Loud.

 Hey, would you ever want to have a real job and a family? (scoffs) Wife? Three kids? Steady job? If I did, I'd secretly be very sad.

 You could tell by how much I would eat and drink and just sit on the couch.

 (gasps) Yeah, thank God that never happened.

 (snoring) Wow.

 He doesn't want to be my dad, he just wants to be a kid like me.

 Almost makes me not want to prank him.

 Almost.

 (grunting) (snoring) TouchÃ©.

 (kids grunting) If you wedgie me, my friend will beat you up.

 That's not your friend, it's your screwed-up dad.

 Pretty sad, really.

 We'll leave you alone.

 You did it, Homer! You saved me from the bullies! You're the coolest kid I ever met.

 What about me? You're in the top hundred.

 Boo-yah! Now you're not.

 (groans): Oh.

 (laughter) (confused grunts) (laughter) (Homer yells, Bart screams) (groans) HOMER: Uh, Lisa, your ma says I should do something with you.

 Need some help with your homework? I'm done.

 Want to see me make a muscle? Mm, not right now.

 Well, that's everything I know that girls like.

 Listen, Homer, I just want to take advantage of this opportunity to have you enjoy my saxophone with me.

 Okay.

 (saxophone playing "Baker Street") (vocalizing along) Ah, thank God they pulled that other safety inspector out of retirement.

 (Homer continues vocalizing) You know, you're the closest thing I've ever had to a brother.

 Me, too.

 You know what? I'm afraid you might change back.

 Change back to what? (sighs) Look in the lake, tell me what you see.

 Bloated corpse under the water.

 I'd say he's been there a few months at least.

 Interesting the way his lips move just like mine.

 Why do you ask? Uh, no reason, brother.

 (laughing) (laughing) (coughing) (gurgling) Geez, I hope this is the call I've been praying for.

 It is.

 We have captured Sven Golly, using a specially dedicated anti-hypnosis squad.

 (bangs into car) Well, bring him here now.

 I want my Homie back.

 I miss him and the things he did.

 Lis, you know how Dad thinks he's a ten-year-old? I've been emotionally dealing with that all week, so yes.

 Well, now that hypnotist is gonna come back and snap him out of it! Look, Dad had to get cured sometime.

 There's nothing we can do about it.

 Or isn't there not? WIGGUM: All right, Sven Golly, you're gonna untangle this guy's noodle, and that's it-- no more hypnotizing anyone.

 You have my word Chief Kangaroo! Boing, boing, boing, boing, boing (groans) (wind whistling) (gasps) They've run away! Quick! Hypnotize me into a a-a competent policeman! I'm good, I'm not that good.

 Ha-ha.

   I wanted you to enjoy being a kid just a little longer.

 HOMER: Whoo-hoo!   HOMER: Whoo hoo-hoo-hoo! (coughing) (Bart and Homer coughing) I do it all myself.

   (two gunshots)   (people screaming) (people clamoring) We've returned to Itchy &amp; Scratchy Land, which means you'll have to pay again.

 What do we do next? What do we do next? WIGGUM: Homer Simpson! Uh, your second childhood is over.

 You're going back to taking statins and paying FICA.

 No! You can't take him now.

 We've only been on two rides.

 You should've used Fastpass.

 Fastpass can't solve everything.

 Eh, spoken like a kid who's never lived in a non-Fastpass world.

 Homer, I'm here.

   Bye, Bart.

 Stay ten forever.

 Good-bye, friend.

 Hmm Before you fix him, can you change one little thing? (quietly): I'm embarrassed to ask this, but after we, uh, snuggle, he always rolls over and goes to sleep, and I'd rather just (whispering indistinctly) That's the only thing you want changed? Everything else about him is perfect? Yes.

 Ugh, where were you when I was straight? All right, let's do this.

 (whispers): Cuddle your wife.

 You are back! Parked! I hate stacked parking! Wait, where am I? This isn't a circus.

 It's an amusement park.

 The furthest thing from a circus.

 Well, here's what happened.

 Marge, sweetie, I'm not gonna lie.

 I must've tied one on at Moe's.

 If you have it in your heart, could you forgive me and totally blame my friends? Homie, I've missed you.

 Ooh-hoo-hoo! I missed you, too.

   (tires screech) (tired sigh) (The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show theme song playing on TV)   What the? Lasagna in bed? Recommended by a kid I used to know.

 You know, I used to have this friend.

 I told him all my dreams.

 Really, really great kid.

 You think so? The best.

 Wonder whatever happened to him? Well maybe you sat on him and he was never seen again.

 Why, you little! Ooh.

 You know, boy, I'm not sure I can strangle you anymore.

 I'm gonna try something new.

 (strained grunt) What do you say, boy, want to split the lasagna? Get lost.

 Why, you little! (moaning, kissing) Oh so good to have you back.

 (yawns) It's great to be back.

 (yawns) (grumbles) Hmm.

 Can we cuddle for a little while? (gasps) Thank you, Sven Golly.

 I knitted us a blanket.

 Mm You can find them for, like, six bucks.

   Check and mate.

 Once again you're too smart for me, my friend.

 That's why I'm the master hypnotist and you're the bumbling police chief.

 Exactly so, Sven Golly.

 Exactly so.

 See you tomorrow? Yes, I might be a little late.

 That Chief Wiggum, what a dope! (gasps) Loki! Shh!   


                





                    			 Ay-ay-ay! (bees buzzing) (birds chirping) Oh! Looks like our birdhouse is benefitting from positive word of beak.

 (laughs) (eagle screeches) A bald eagle! It is! (screeches) Maybe he's giving those little baby birds some food.

 (screams) (screeches) (gasps) Homer, quick! Get your shooing broom.

 Marge, an eagle is our country's mascot! Fighting him is like kicking George Washington in his wooden nuts! Aah! (grunting) (screeches) (grunts) Ow.

 Ow.

 This means war! Boy, bring my toupee.

 Go ahead, boy.

 MILHOUSE: It's working! It's definitely working! For once, we're finally gonna catch that mouse.

 (screeches) Got you! Ha.

ha! Stupid eagle! It wasn't the mouse we were after.

 It was you! Marge, preheat the oven! (grunting) (screeching) I got him cornered, boy! Bag him up! (screeching) (grunting) (laughing) Not so majestic in a trash bag, are you? Oopsie.

 (puffing) Seems almost a shame I'm gonna have to bang you against the wall till you die.

 No! Let's take the eagle to Shelbyville Animal Rescue where you took that injured hummingbird you found on the front lawn.

 Uh um Or maybe we can nurse him back to health and set him free in the wild.

 Okay, Bart, think of a name.

 Make it great-- insanely, unbelievably great! Squawky? Perfect.

 Just like when we let you name Maggie.

 (humming) Squawky, until I met you, I never thought I could love something bald.

 (screeches) Bye! We love you.

 (all gasp) Oh, my God.

 Brace yourselves, family.

 We're about to meet a being with intelligence far beyond ours.

 Boy, give me my baseball bat.

 Hello.

 I'm Elon Musk.

 Die! What the? Dad, no! Elon Musk is possibly the greatest living inventor! You're the guy who put wheels on luggage? Oh, bless you! Bless you! (crying) I'm-I'm not that guy.

 His company perfected electric cars and then gave away the patents! He changed the way Hollywood drives! And now he's landed in our yard.

 On my son's bike and on our mailman's leg.

 Honey, guess who crushed me? I'll give you a hint.

 His first name is Elon.

 Ah! That's right! So, what brings you to Springfield, Mr.

 Musk? What does bring me to Springfield? Well, to start with, I'm an idea man.

 It's my raison d'Ãªtre.

 Mmm, Raisin Detra.

 I've hit a dry patch.

 I'm blocked.

 In my personal drought, I'm traveling the country quietly by spaceship, looking for inspiration.

 That's so sad.

 Maybe we're the same.

 Two lost ships in the intellectual sea.

 Each of whom could inspire the other to reach Hey, Elon, if you're interested, you could come to the nuclear plant where I work tomorrow.

 I am and I will! Great.

 And if anyone asks where I am, just cover for me.

 Homer! Fine! We'll both go, and if anybody asks you something you don't understand, just say protons.

 So do you get satellite radio cheaper in space? Homer, if we're gonna carpool together, there's one thing you have to know.

 Ass, gas or grass-- no one rides for free.

 It's as old as the Bible.

 No, it's that I don't talk to anyone unless they provide the mental stimulation I seek.

 Ditto.

 (Lisa giggles nervously) Hi.

 I didn't want to miss one more chance to spend time with Mr.

 Musk.

 It is such an honor.

 He is.

 And may I save that paper? "No ideas.

" (gasps) That's sad.

 (gasps) That's even worse.

 (gasps) Aw, man, I wish those were white meatballs.

 (triumphant orchestra music playing) Oh, my.

 That's an idea! White meatballs-- synthetic meat that you can print in your printer.

 Say something else.

 Please! Now! Uh don't tase me, bro.

 Chocolate rain! Tase, bro, chocolate rain.

 Use electroplating to remove metal ions from rainwater, making it suitable for drinking.

 What about the chocolate? We'll make the device a soothing chocolate color-- brilliant! He's taking your Homerisms and turning them into his own great ideas! This is the most inspirational moment of my life, but unfortunately, this is my stop.

 Bye.

 Well, come on, keep throwing things at me.

 Um (grunts) Oh, this is a break.

 We're-we're taking a break! (grunts) (laughs) (both laughing) I got you! MUSK: You're fun.

 Well, duh.

 Why don't have fun like that, Lou? (huffing) Ah, Chief! Did anyone ever tell you there's a safety on that gun? What do you mean this thing? (grunts) That's the trigger! What are you writing? Share, buddy.

 Suggestion for the suggestion box.

 Can anyone make a suggestion? Be my guest, but I seriously doubt the old man ever reads them.

 Suggestion 8,432.

 Nix! Hmm, technically an order, not a suggestion.

 "Installing an MHD generator "would allow the plant to "operate at a higher temperature "without the tyranny of moving parts using conducting plasma as the moving conductor"? Excellent.

 Clearly the work of Lenny.

 That's the white one, right? Is this your suggestion? No.

 No, mine was rubber mats in the decontamination showers.

 Also, water in the decontamination showers.

 Never! Mm-hmm.

 Mm.

 Good Lord! Sir, you know who that is? The man who's revolutionized the car industry.

 Henry Ford, good to see you.

 As healthy and vibrant as Detroit itself.

 No, sir, this is Elon Musk.

 For some reason, he's sharing a console with Homer Simpson.

 His mind is as rich as an Italian wedding soup.

 Homer, what are you thinking now? Uh, Pittsburgh 35, Dallas 31! (triumphant orchestra music playing) Pittsburgh steel, Dallas Cowboys Robotic cattle herding! Thank you, Homer.

 (gentle music playing) Sorry, that's something I'm working on so that I don't have to display facial expressions.

 (electrical crackling) Young man, I look at you and I see myself.

 How much would you charge to work for me? I don't care about the money.

 The whole monetary system is just a series of interconnected heterogeneous databases.

 Could you repeat that first part? I don't care about the money.

 Once more with feeling? I don't care about the money.

 Now, let me feel the vibrations of your lips.

 (muffled): I don't care about the money.

 And I want you to get your fingers out of my mouth! Smithers, there's something strange in his mouth.

 It's called moisture.

 Hmm, I see.

 Okay, Musk, what do you propose? Well, you'll need to increase the capacity of your plant.

 You cover the costs, you get 100% of the profits.

 Careful, Elon, he's not as kindly as he appears.

 (creaking) Now, Burns, what if everything in town not powered by electricity were powered my electricity.

 The electricity you sell them.

 Imagine that.

 (gasps) My doctor says I'm not allowed to imagine, so I hired someone to do it for me.

 Send in the imaginer.

 (humming) Oh, that's fabulous.

 Oh, my goodness, I can see everything.

 I'm in.

 Oh, by the way, Mr.

 Burns? I haven't been paid in a while.

 Here you go.

 Imagine.

 Ooh, Swiss francs! Time to take my wife for a night on the town.

 Hey, wait a minute! (sniffs) So, what kind of lunch do you pack? Wow, Elon, you're like Willy Wonka without the underpaid munchkins.

 Uh, I'd like to offer you something.

 But all I got is coffee.

 With cream! Come on, I want cream.

 Give it up.

 (grunting) D'oh! Cream and sugar are one thing too many! (triumphant orchestra music playing) Exactly, exactly! What if we made the cream cup out of sugar so it dissolved in the coffee? Wow.

 Wow! Between your genius and my nothing, we make a great team! Come on, give me a hug.

 Sorry, I'm not one for hugging.

 Well, I'm not one for just talking.

 (violin playing romantic melody) Does that drone do date nights with the wife? My partner, Montgomery Burns ALL: Boo! and I (cheering) Hooray! have exciting news.

 Springfield Nuclear has electric solutions to all of your energy needs.

 The Springfield Hyperloop.

 Electrifying the school to replace the old power source, Willy pushing a wheel.

 (drumming rhythmically) And my passion project, the Glayvinator.

 You have a Glayvinator, too? Is it, um, uh, patent-pending? Patent granted.

 All the years of Glayvining in my basement for naught! I'm a failure.

 Ah, yes, everyone's been there.

 You have those feelings, too? Of course not.

 If I knew how to make a fist, I'd hit you.

 This is wonderful, Smithers.

 For once in my life, something's going my way.

 I'm not so sure.

 Oh, another visit from Mr.

 Worrywart.

 I don't trust Musk.

 Anyone with that much money has a darkness in his soul.

 Says you.

 (sighs) SMITHERS: Mr.

 Burns? Mr.

 Burns? Sir, Musk's ideas sound great, too great.

 We're meant for wretched lives.

 We should pass on this.

 And before you reply, remember, I've never let you down.

 You know what I'm going to say, right? Release the I was going to say "Get out," but your idea sounds better.

 (sighs) Can you give me a ten-second head start? Of course.

 One, two, three! (barking) Not on my carpet.

 Attention, fans of The Little Rascals.

 The last of them died today in Palm Springs.

 Now it's time for traffic with Arnie Pye.

 Nothing to report, Kent.

 Since Elon Musk gave everyone self-driving cars, there hasn't been a single accident.

 (chuckles) Well, you be careful up there, Arnie.

 No need.

 Mr.

 Musk gave me a self-flying chopper! Where's Arnie? Now I can get as loaded as I want, which is pretty damn loaded.

 Oh, boy.

  Elon, Elon, you're my guy   Since you came down from the sky.

  (gulping) Car, go park at work so people think I'm there.

 (horn honks) AUTOMATED VOICE: Force of habit.

 Car, wake Grampa.

 (zapping) (Grampa groaning) Thank you.

 Mm.

 (mutters) Bart, what are you doing? Disable auto drive.

 AUTOMATED VOICE: Foolish boy.

 You'll never guess Elon Musk's master password.

 Musk rulez, with a "Z.

" AUTOMATED VOICE: Password verified.

 Manual control enabled.

 (laughs) (tires squealing) Welcome, friends.

 I have invited you here to share in our first quarterly profit report.

 I'm sure you're all eager to hear how much richer I am.

 Now, to end the suspense, Elon? Thank you, Monty.

 At our current rate Yes? assuming a linear growth model Of course! we are losing roughly $50 million a quarter.

 Just remember, our purpose is to show the planet how to save itself.

 Oh, the planet.

 I adore the planet.

 Do you know my favorite part of the planet? Gravity! There are no trapdoors on this podium, Burns.

 You just started the PowerPoint presentation.

   No, no, no! Musk, you tricked me.

 Not a trick.

 We sacrifice now to take care of the future in a way totally determined by me.

 (groans) All I wanted was to make obscene profits in the last year of my life and leave it to no one.

 Why does God hate dreamers? Due to recent fluctuations in my judgment, and the once in a lifetime mistake of trusting another human being, I am saddened to announce massive layoffs.

 Who will pay for my radiation sickness treatments? Not my concern.

 But Musk was our savior! Your so-called savior isn't interested in saving anything but the world.

 Bah! Burns' layoffs have thrown the city into a new depression, marked by the singing of songs from the old depression.

 If you're old enough to have suffered then and now, why don't you sing along?  Now the rain's a-fallin'   Hear the trains a-callin'   Whoo-ee   My mama done told me   Hear that lonesome whistle   Blowin' cross the trestle   Whoo-ee   My mama done told me   A-Whoo-ee   A-Whoo-ee  (clopping hoofbeats)  Oh, clickety-clack and it's echoing back   The blues in the night.

  My final invention.

 A pill that removes all grief.

 (chittering) Ah (groans) (chittering) Oh, my God, it attracts women, too.

 You're welcome, you're welcome, you're welcome.

 (distorted): You're welcome.

 (whistles) You really came back from that Tommy John surgery.

 Tell Musk there's more where that came from.

 More of what? (groans) BURNS: Smithers, the hounds feel terrible for what they did, and good news, one pooped out your ear.

 We'll dip it in iodine, and it's just like new.

 (groans) Also, I'm sorry, I couldn't find the records of the shots the hounds had which, in turn, led to all those painful injections in your abdomen.

 (groans) Now, the reason I'm here I've made the calls.

 I'm gonna have Elon Musk killed, and I'll give you a little extra morphine, friend.

 (screaming) (dogs snarling) Oh, right, that's a trapdoor.

 (groans) What's wrong, Homer? Is it that all your friends are out of work, and it's kind of your fault? (scoffs) No, it's Elon.

 I don't care how much he likes me, I don't want to be friends with him anymore.

 None of his pie in the sky ideas ever work out.

 Sky pies are lie pies.

 Of all the planets in the universe, why did he have to come to this one? How do you break up with a guy? Here's what you do.

 You just take his hand, look in his eyes, and say, "I don't want to be with you anymore.

" Wow, you're good at that.

 It's gotten me out of a lot of gym memberships.

   Sir, I have my concern about the team of hit men you've assembled.

 They seem a little long in the tooth.

 Nonsense.

 Just because a man can't see or hold his hands steady doesn't make him any less of a marksman.

 A yoga mat that rolls itself up.

 Silent Velcro, baseball tickets that guide you to your seat.

 (gunshots) Sweet Columbian Exposition! Musk lives.

 But, uh, three of your hit men don't.

 Recoil was pretty bad.

 Oh, my God, Oh, my God.

 You saved my life! Which is gonna make what I'm about to say even more awkward.

 Whatever you want, we'll make it work, right, Homer? Elon, Elon, Elon, I want to say something to you, and I don't want you to be inspired by it.

 I want you to listen.

 No! I don't want to be with you anymore.

 Can I ask why? I could say it's the being shot at, or the flat, emotionless way you talk, or the fact that PayPal was my idea, and I was just about to do it when you came out with it, but really it's that this town isn't ready for you.

 And neither am I.

 It's okay; I'll be fine.

 (gentle music playing) It's on your face, too.

 Well, I did save you one last prize from the Cracker Jack box that is my brain.

 Use it as you will.

 On the Miami Dolphins helmet, the little dolphin is also wearing a helmet.

 Why are they always the most beautiful just when they're breaking up with you? I think it's time to tell my luggage to self pack.

 (beeps) Good-bye, Elon.

 Our town will never forgive you.

 Thanks for the real working lightsaber.

 (whooshing) Ay, caramba! (giggles) I just wanted to see if there was a better life, even for a little bit.

 When you're 16, I'll drive you to Cincinnati, and you'll see what there is to see.

 Mr.

 Musk, before you go, is there anything you could do to give a little girl hope that the world of the future won't be as grim as all our current movies forecast? I guess humanity wants its change one birdhouse at a time.

 Hmm, for a man who likes electric cars, he sure burns a lot of rocket fuel.

 (moans) What's wrong, Dad? Nothing.

 Elon's log, Earth date, 25 January, 2015.

 I have left Springfield forever, but there are some things I will definitely miss.

 The little dolphin is also wearing a helmet.

 Wearing a helmet.

 Wearing a helmet.

 I never thought I'd say this, but sometimes holograms miss the point.

  There's a starman   Waiting in the sky   He'd like to come and meet us   But he thinks he'd blow our minds   There's a starman   Waiting in the sky   He's told us not to blow it   'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile   He told me   Let the children lose it   Let the children use it   Let all the children boogie   There's a starman   Waiting in the sky   He'd like to come and meet us   But he thinks he'd blow our minds   There's a starman   Waiting in the sky   He's told us not to blow it   'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile   He told me   Let the children lose it   Let the children use it   Let all the children boogie.

  Shh!   


                





                    			 (giggles) D'oh! (grunts) Woo-hoo! (screams) D'oh! And I regret to inform you that our Soviet sister city, Springograd, has disappeared from the map.

 Now, I'd like to welcome our beloved four-time mayor, Hans Moleman! (applause) Springfielders, rejoice.

 What is the one thing our blessed little town has lacked? A human zoo? What we lack is a town anthem.

 And you're in luck, because I have written one.

 Mr.

 Largo, if you please.

 Mm-hmm.

    There's a special little place   A special smile on every face   A town called Springfield   Special buildings, special sky   A unique place to live and die   Only Springfield   Of all the cities on the mappy   You're the one that makes me happy   Only Springfield, only Springfield  Stop the anthem! What is it, Moe? I was in Tuscaloosa on vacation.

 Started out great.

 They got a joint there called Moe's Original Barbeque.

 But then I heard their city anthem! Give a listen!  Of all the cities on the mappy   You're the one that makes me happy   Only Tuscaloosa, only Tuscaloosa.

  That's our song.

 They just changed "Springfield" to "Tuscaloosa.

" (growls) Guns are for celebrating.

 What do you do with them when you're angry? Now, calm down.

 This could just be an amazing musical coincidence.

 There ain't no coincidences in popular songs, bony.

  Only Austin   Only Oakland   Only Calgary   Only Provo  (singing in foreign language)  Area 51  (crowd clamoring) We've been singing this song like it only belonged to us, when every city in America's had its lips on it! Even Des Moines.

 Wait a minute.

 This song was supposedly written by former Mayor Moleman! (crowd murmuring) Oh, I didn't write it.

 I bought it from a salesman who was selling it to half the towns in America.

 I didn't think you'd find out, because I never thought any of us would ever go anywhere.

 Well, then what do I do with this?! Now I can't be buried in a Jewish cemetery! Please be merciful.

 Hyah! (horse neighs) Boy, sure is nice not to be the one on the horse for a change.

 As mayor, I balanced the budget eight times! I still believe in this town-- a town that deserves its own original song.

 And as an aspiring musician with off-Broadway dreams, I'm the one to write it.

 So ordered.

 I'll write that song.

 Pharrell Williams?! I'm sorry, everyone, but the eight-year-old girl got there first.

 I understand.

  It might seem crazy what I'm about to say   Sunshine, she's here, you can take a break  Hyah! Shelbyville rules! Springfield drools! Let's see.

 What rhymes with "Jebediah"? "Tire fire"? How about "Patty and Selma"? "Fatty and smell ya.

" "Mr.

 Teeny"? "Sister wienie.

" You've got a gift! Well, don't be so surprised.

 I did write that "Lisa, It's Your Birthday" song.

 Yeah, with that mental patient who thought he was Michael Jackson.

 Whoa.

 Thinking back, I'm kind of surprised Mom and Dad let a crazy man spend all night in my bedroom.

 Simpler time.

 Bart, I need your help to write a new anthem for Springfield.

 Will you team up with me? Hmm.

 What's in it for me? Uh, I'll make brownies later.

 Whoa, that is the best deal any songwriter ever got.

 And that's true even if I don't get the brownies.

 I'm in! I think we might just make a good team, like Maggie and Grampa.

   What are you doing? What's it look like? Writing a song.

 (scoffs) Artists.

 (makes farting noises)   We did it! We wrote an awesome song! We make a great brother and sister team, like Andy and Lana Wachowski.

 Should we hug? Mm, how about a fist bump through a towel? That works.

 (laughs) I saved us seats.

 Oh, thank you, Homie.

 Thank you, roll of masking tape.

 Uh, gonna be a tight fit.

 (grunting) (sighs)  Springfield's the only home that we've got   But to be frank, there's not a lot   To recommend it   We've got a big sinkhole   And they shut down the think hole   Hashtag: SpringfieldPride   Has never ever trended  This is not boosterism! Warm up the horse.

  But when you think of the things we lack   'Stead of the stuff we've got   Why Springfield?   Why not?   We've only had a hurricane once   We haven't had a circus fire in months   Springfield   Why not?   Ooh, we're just off the interstate   Ah, the second right off exit 8  He didn't blow his line.

 Sarah, let's have another!  You may find our culture lacking   We finally outlawed our snake whacking   Sure, our cops are easily bought   And our dentists are all self-taught   But hooray for Springfield   Give two cheers   Smallpox-free for seven years   Why Springfield?   Why not?  (crowd cheering) What a song! I feel as if I'm in the lobby of the Brill Building! (cheering continues) Homer, it's a standing ovation.

 Get up.

 Our kids just did something amazing.

 Well, not Maggie.

 Get up! Okay, okay.

 Standing "O" or die! (grunting loudly) Woo-hoo! (laughter) Stop laughing at me! (crowd screams) (groans) (screams) (sighs) Occupied.

 (crowd screaming) Stop fearing me! (sobbing) Damn it! Please keep spinning it.

 I don't want to look at it.

 Can't you say something to make me feel better? (sighs) I'm sorry, but I can't.

 I'm tired of you saying planes have gotten smaller and two presidents were fatter than you, and (sighs) Fine, I got it.

 Starting right now, a yearlong juice cleanse.

 Every morning, I get a colonic, and I sleep in a sauna every night.

 Oh, that's not a healthy way to lose weight.

 It's not about health, Marge, it's about going crazy.

 You don't have to do this alone.

 What the? Hmm.

 (sighs) This is it.

 My name is Roy, and this week I gained seven pounds.

 Yes! No shame there! You go, girth! Huh? Oh, I'm sorry.

 I thought you were Over-feeders Anonymous.

 No, no.

 In fact, quite the opposite.

 We are Big Is Beautiful.

 So you guys are proud of what you are? We do not cower in the shadows, we make the shadows.

 Do you guys serve snacks? We've got ice cream hoagies, deep-fried sugar bags, Dorsnickos, Snickeritos, Milky Snicks, Porksicles, and of course diet soda.

 Oh, got to have diet soda.

 Oh, yeah, of course.

 Yes, mustn't forget the diet soda.

 I have so many questions for you.

 First of all, is this floor reinforced? You know, maybe I shouldn't be here.

 I promised my wife I'd lose weight.

 Huh? MAN: If I may.

 Ooh, labels.

 Our loved ones, though precious, can often be a hurdle.

 Who are you? I'm the founder of our little group, Albert.

 Ooh, like Fat Albert! We never use the word "fat" here.

 Sorry.

 My dear fat friend, all your wife needs is a little education.

 Now repeat after me.

 I am big.

 I am big.

 I am beautiful.

 I have a beauty of a sort to some.

 No one can make me feel bad about who I am because this is who I am! Ditto! You know, I've always wanted to blindly follow somebody, and I think you just might be the guy.

 Marge, kids, tonight was a turning point in my life.

 Well, that's great, Homie.

 Just let me finish uploading this photo.

 HOMER: No, Marge, you have to listen! That place you sent me to changed my life.

 Thank you, Lord! And I'll give up online scrapbooking, like I promised.

 They taught me that I don't need to lose weight.

 I should just be proud of what I am.

 What? Restore, restore! (buzzer sounds) I met a guy a wonderful guy Oh, Lord.

 It's not what you think.

 His name is Albert, and he taught me not to buy into the lies taught by Big Nutrition.

 That's worse than what I thought.

 Marge, you're my wife of ten years and I love you, but I must observe the teachings of this man I just met tonight.

 Now, the first thing I have to do is make amends.

 With the bathroom scale.

 I'm so sorry I threw you across the room and called you a liar.

 When you told me I was 260 pounds, you were just encouraging me.

 It was a poem you were writing about my potential.

 I'm gonna start celebrating my size, and I need you with me as a partner.

 Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to talk to the broken porch swing.

 HOMER: So, from now on, you guys can no longer say these hateful words: "Chubby, chunky, blobbo, slobbo, "fat bastard, Michelin Man, Stay Puft, Chumbawumba, "It is balloon! "Papa Grande, Augustus Gloop, "beached whale, big-boned, Wisconsin skinny, "butterball, dump truck, "Jelly Belly, pudgy-wudgy, "lard-ass, blubberino, Buddha belly, "Hurry Eat Tubman, one-ton soup, "Blob Saget, Chub Hub, Calvin Cool Whip, "Manfred Mannboobs, "walking 'before' picture, fatso, Harvey Milk Chocolate, "Obese Want Cannoli, Mahatma Gumbo, "Salvador Deli, Elmer Pantry, "KFC and the Sponge Cake Band, Snackie Onassis, "The Foody Blues, Hoagie Carmichael and wide load.

" What about Mr.

 Two Belts? Good, good! By which I mean, "Bad, bad!" You know, as long as we're opening this up-- and I'm glad you are-- I want to tell you guys that when you call me a gargoyle, a troll or a homunculus, it kind of hurts my feelings.

 What? You're kidding.

 We never dreamed.

 Who knew goblins had feelings? You see? That's what I'm talking about.

 Because CROWD (chanting): We're big! We're proud! Two of us can make a crowd! Sorry, fellas.

 There's a movement I have to join.

 I've learned there's something more important than drinking: eating.

 Thank you for the easy financing! What the?! Your store is forcing unattainable body images on our young people.

 I say, end the thinsanity! You, my friend, are wrong.

 Every girl should look like a sexy praying mantis from Milan whose hips are narrower than an Italian parliamentary majority.

 Whew.

 (siren whoops) Okay, people, show's over.

 Nothing to eat here.

 Now move along.

 If you can.

 If not, we're gonna have to take you in.

 Clancy, what are you doing? You're one of us! You're right.

 Take me in, Lou.

 Ow, ah.

 (grunting) Hey! Why? Ah, geez, Lou.

 You seem to be enjoying this.

 Just doing my job, Chief.

 (Taser crackles) Oh, that's some nice Tase work, Lou.

 (grunting) Homer Simpson? HOMER: Right here! Excuse me.

 Pardon me.

 Coming through.

 Coming back.

 Excuse me.

 Pardon me.

 There we go.

 Uh, coming up.

 What can I do for you? You're free on bail.

 People, give thanks to that woman, standing up for all of us, even though she's a lighty.

 Thank you.

 Although, I think the worst thing that ever happened to my husband was joining your group.

 (crowd gasps, murmurs) (clears throat) I'll handle this.

 What is the point of a long life if it's not enjoyed? (drooling moan) Homer, you have to choose.

 And I think the choice is clear.

 Guys, I'm coming back in! Suck in your guts.

 (all inhaling) (sighs) Home.

 (groans) (laughing) Whee! Whee! Who's he giving a piggyback ride to? We don't know.

 Mom, what's wrong? How come Dad's not with you? Are they setting bail by the pound? (laughs) He chose to spend the night in a jail with strangers instead of me.

 Mom, Lisa and I learned that we can solve any problem through song.

 Lisa, let's go write something that'll change Dad's mind.

 Do you really think that we can write a song that does that? I just wanted to get out of the room.

 She was really bumming me out.

 Ah, geez.

 I thought writing another hit song would be easier.

 Well, it would've helped if you hadn't crumpled up all the paper before we wrote anything on it.

 No more judgment! No more jokes! We will not be made to feel less than because we are greater than! I was distinctly promised no math! Homer, I want to say something extremely important the way a woman does-- subtly, through someone else.

 Kids   Take it, Bart! You take it! I gave it to you! I refuse to accept it! LENNY: Just start the song! We couldn't write a song.

 We're one-hit wonders.

 But is that such a crime? Look at J.

D.

 Salinger.

 Franny and Zooey.

 Rubik's Cube! Rubik's Snake! Charles M.

 Schulz.

 You've got me there.

 It's her fault.

 She was sucking all the gangsta out of everything.

 Well, you're the only "gangsta" I know with a 9:00 bedtime.

 Mom said.

 Ah, kids, stop arguing.

 Or keep arguing.

 I don't care.

 Homer, I'm sorry I tried to help you control your weight.

 (sighs) I'm not sure of anything anymore.

 Sorry I ever opened my mouth.

 Marge, it's not your fault that you can't win against a superior being like Albert.

 (slurps) Mmm.

 But, Marge, I don't want you to ever stop caring about me.

 How can you follow a leader who won't even get up out of his chair? Marge, I believe you're forgetting America's greatest wartime wheelchair-bound leader: Professor X of the X-Men.

 It's not that Professor X wouldn't get up, it's that he couldn't! Well, I'll show you who can get up! (triumphant music playing) (footsteps thudding heavily) (roars) That's right! I don't need this scooter! All of you, follow me to the future! (groans) Oh, dear God.

 Stick a forklift in him, he's dead.

 (laughs) (organ playing solemn music) I've never written a eulogy before, but this time, I did.

 Unfortunately, I left it at home.

 Thanks, lady.

 What Albert taught us is that all people have pride and no group should ever be insulted.

 He knew what was important was how you lived your life every day.

 Till he was taken from us too soon, at the age of (whispering) Twenty-three?! People, for God's sake, join a gym! (crowd murmuring) Kumiko, would you still love me if I lost weight? Much more! (sighs) Marge, I'm sorry I was proud of myself.

 That's not really what I was It will never happen again! Now come on.

 Let's walk home.

 Absolutely.

 Can I ask you something? What is it that keeps you with me? It's because everything you love, you love so much.

 Because you love me, I will not stop yo-yo dieting till I get it right.

 Oh At last.

 Well done, Dad.

 You finally reached emotional maturity.

 Unlike Bart.

 Bart's very mature.

 Take it from the little boy in his tummy.

 Now, when do I get to be the head again? Soon.

 It's always "soon.

" Whoa! (horse neighs) Oh.

 I wish I had said that earlier.

 Shh!   


                





                    			 (8-bit synthesized version of theme song playing)   (electronic bell dinging) (synthesized whistle blows) (blipping) (rapid blipping) (synthesized jazz playing) (synthesized saxophone playing) (blipping) (blipping) (synthesized horn honks) (tires screech) (bell dings) (synthesized scream) (synthesized meowing, barking)   (theme song ends) ( The Jetsons theme song playing)    Here's Homer Simpson   And the problem child  (jazzy sax solo plays)  Hip daughter Lisa   Marge, his wife  ( The Jetsons theme song ends) (computer printer buzzing, scratching) HOMER: Marge! Stop that crazy thing! I've printed out our driving plan.

 If we work together, we can get Bart to his sports, Lisa to her music, and Maggie to the five birthday parties she's invited to today.

 I'm not spending my precious Saturday chauffeuring those overprivileged kids to a better life than I ever had.

 I need a ride to Cub Scouts.

 Why are you asking me? Is your thumb broken? (screams) (tires screeching) Have him back by Father's Day! Homie, are you dressed? You have soccer setup in 20 minutes! Homie? (phone ringing, Homer gasping) Moe, quick-- beer me before I answer the phone! Ah, the first pour of the day.

 Let me just tie on my apron, limber up the old tap-pulling arm (grunting) (phone continues ringing) Ooh eh I need it now! (gulping) (sighs) Hey, Marge.

 I'm supposed to help drive the kids? Oh, man, I wish I knew that sooner, but I just had a beer.

 You're already drinking at 8:00 in the morning? How much have you had? (whimpers) Come on! Whoo-hoo! Off the hook! (sighing): Oh, looks like this is all me.

 HOMER: Yeah, while you're at it, can you pick me up some beer? Oh   (siren wailing) Well, we've got an hour.

 Who wants coffee? Okay, but I'm buying.

 No, no, I insist.

 I'm stealing.

     (revving engines) (engines roar) (tires screeching at every stop) (engines roaring) See you at the bake sale, sucker! So Sideshow Mel is drinking here all afternoon.

 When I show him the tab, he says he left his wallet in his other skirt, and he pays me with this.

 Hey, this is a ticket to see Laney Fontaine.

 She's the brassiest broad on Broadway! She's funny and vulgar and full of Hollywood stories, like, uh Jimmy Stewart was a super-nice guy.

 Oh, geez, now I want to go.

 Why can't ya? I can't close down the bar on a Saturday.

 That's when you guys can drink, 'cause you're not working for three days.

 Hey, Moe, I'll take care of the bar.

 You did me a favor today.

 Huh well, okay.

 Uh, let me just show you where everything is.

 Uh Shotgun, shotgun shells, blood mop, bag of lime and that's it.

 Now, boys, I gotta get dressed for the, uh the-a-ter.

 (laughs) And done.

 Dare I say it? Yippee.

 Oh I didn't know we could decorate our cars.

 No, no-- it's a "Here to There" smile.

 When that's on my grille, I'm getting paid to drive people around.

 So you're a taxi? No (laughs) no, no no.

 We're a social-media-based ride share service.

 We bring the "fair" back to "fares.

" Those aren't air quotes.

 My fingers start doing that after they're around the wheel all day.

 Mm.

 Well, I drive all day, and I don't get paid a thing.

 With the money you make, I could buy a fridge with an ice maker.

 (laughs, gasps) (moans) (laughs) Do you want to work for us? Sure! Are you over 23? (giggles) Yes.

 And are you under 80? Yes! You're in! Oh! What the? When I was a young car, I didn't sit around smiling, like I had nothing better to do.

 (humming) Man, Moe's barely got two nickels to rub together.

 (murmuring) I know a way we can make this Moe's biggest Saturday night ever.

 How does Moe make money if ladies drink free? That's the beauty part.

 This place is about to be filled with guys buying beers, hoping to meet ladies.

 (chuckles) Brilliant! Oh, and thanks for telling me what the beauty part of it was.

 So they pull out my gall bladder, zip me up.

 I grabbed a cab, tapped my understudy and said, "Not tonight, honey.

" And here's the song I killed 'em with.

 (audience whoops, applauds)  If this isn't love   The whole world is crazy   If this isn't love   Who's this Patrick Swayze?  (laughs) She changed the lyrics! For me! (dog howls in distance) Then came the bombs: Tobacco Valley, What Color Is Your Tambourine, and The Smell of Music-- but I'm still here.

 And I'd like to dedicate this song to the one great love of my life, the man who was my third and fifth husband-- but you never know what the future holds.

 Oh-ho! (dance music throbbing, lively conversations) Huh.

 Not a man in sight.

 We got the Cheery Red Tomatoes, a bachelorette party Ooh! Lady Duff! I am woman, hear me pour! Oh, yeah! There's no guys! We haven't made any money.

 Not yet, but at least we're hearing some interesting conversation from those two book clubs.

 Well, we thought The Heaven Lover's Club was rich and spiritual.

 We thought it was maybe a little slow.

 Oh, well, maybe I can liven it up for ya! (grunts) (screaming, clamoring) Let me help you up.

 Ow! MOE (moaning): Oh, yeah.

 Uh, okay, stop here, please.

 So this is the charming tavern you've been telling me about.

 Yep, nice and cozy and Wha? (gasps) My crap hole! My precious crap hole! Anyone tries to stop me, and you'll see her lovely bones all over the floor! This is nuts.

 Tell me you still work, Love Tester.

 (buzzing) Oh, I'm ruined! Sorry, Moe.

 I love losers, but only after they've bounced at the bottom.

  'Cause I'm the brassiest piece of sass   In this whole damn town!  Hyah! You guys cost me my chance with a woman of a certain age! (sobs) []Hey, come on, all is not lost.

 This coaster's fine.

 (howling) You are not my friends.

 To me, you're just mouths drinking beers.

 You can't mean that! We don't look at you that way.

 Yeah, I'm-I'm sorry for snapping at you guys, but but I'm ruint! I have to live on my savings here.

 All right, who rubbed my nickels?! Hey, wait a minute-- we can get you a job.

 There's an opening at the nuclear plant, 'cause of that guy that defected to North Korea.

 Good old Dae Ho.

 Used to give me the pickles off his sandwich.

 And all I had to do was let him copy some keys.

 Moe, can you pass a background check? Um Eh Er, uh Eh Sure.

 Well, then, you're in.

 How far do they go back? Six months.

 Okay, I'm gonna apply in a week.

 (text alert chimes) Whoa, Mom! Someone wants you to give them a ride.

 At last! I'll earn money for schlepping.

 Well, your mom has a job and my dad still doesn't? Just wait till winter comes, son.

 There'll be driveways to salt! Long, long driveways.

 Thanks for the lift.

 It's nice to know I can get a ride without having to put out.

 You're welcome.

 You know, if you really want to get your belly button pierced, go see a professional.

 I'm ready for you, babe.

 (clacking) I'm gonna have this done properly, at a kiosk in the mall.

 I'm Shauna.

 Welcome to Springfield Nuclear, Szyslak.

 We'll start you off in Janitorial, but there is room for advancement.

 Hey, I sure appreciate this, fellas.

 What you guys did to me, then for me, I'll never forget-slash-forgive, so thanks a lot.

 Also (angrily): thanks a lot! What's for dinner, Mom? I-I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm not your mother.

 Hey, I'm the one payin'.

 Fine! There's meat loaf.

 Mmm! What's meat loaf? Left left, left! Left Left, left! Left, left! Eh left! Flamingos turn pink from eating shrimp.

 Cats have over a hundred vocal cords.

 The Golden Gate Bridge is the longest span between two towers.

 Why are you telling me all these things? Isn't this Cash Cab? No! Oh! It's never Cash Cab.

 Oh Faster! Eh, slower.

 Hard a-port! Disco Stu says hang a "U"! Make a Louie up here at the Stop sign! Blood bank! Girl with big punching bags? So, for the love of God, get me to Mexico! Hey, swabbie, you've missed spots there, another one there, and there! Every other spot is be-grimed! It's called a checkerboard floor, ya unwrapped mummy.

 You're f Sir the NRC is here for a surprise inspection.

 We are gonna search this place from top to bottom.

 (shrieks) That's where all the problems are.

 I'll handle this, uh You're the head inspector, huh? Yes, I am.

 How come, on your badge, you got a mustache, but now you're not wearing one, huh? Oh, I was Freddie Mercury in a Queen cover band, but, uh, then I got demoted to Brian May.

 Yeah, well, I'm thrilled for your musical career and everything, but, uh, we got no way of knowing that this is you.

 I mean, we gotta be careful here.

 This is one of them, uh, highly sensitive joints.

 It'll take me weeks to grow that mustache back.

 Or years, to get a new badge! Yeah, well, that's your problem, ain't it? You will see us again, in God knows when.

 Young man, how do you fit such brilliance into such an ugly, ethnic head? Well, if you own a bar, you either keep it clean or learn to deal with inspectors.

 And Moe don't clean.

 Interesting attitude for a janitor.

 What say we make you the new supervisor of Sector 7G? Me, a supervisor? I feel like I overdosed and went to heaven! (laughs) Those smart cars are cutting into our business.

 We used to get uber amounts of work giving people lifts.

 (splutters) I come to America to drive taxi.

 Now my cab sits empty, like Sochi Marriott.

 Well, boss, the main problem is Marge Simpson! She's prompt, courteous and a joy to ride with.

 How do you know so much? Oh, she, uh, drives me to work every day.

 And unlike the rest of you cowards, she's not afraid to parallel park.

 (laughing, whooping) Whoa, fellas, that is not acceptable.

 This is a nuclear plant! (grunts) Huh.

 No one was in there.

 Look, Moe, the least you could let me do is anything I want.

 All right, let me be honest with youse.

 After all the money this plant lost on that nitwit, Elon Musk, they're looking for cutbacks, so I've been going over your record.

 (whimpers): Oh! Yeah, the only reason you haven't been fired is because your file here was holding up a sofa that was missing a leg.

 Well, that's the logic-- where's the affection? Well, as supervisor, I can't fraternize with the, uh, uh, what's the word? Scum.

 Anyway, because I am your friend, you are safe.

 But you're gonna be reassigned.

 Smithers, "what profit a man if he gain the world, and lose his soul?" Seriously, I need an amount.

 In round dollars.

 (knocking on door) Plant watering guy.

 Yes, yes, go ahead.

 Uh, and be careful with the Venus flytrap.

 All right.

 They say you catch more flies with honey.

 I say, with flytraps.

 (muffled): What do I do now? Just lean into it.

 It'll be over soon, one way or another.

 (muffled): Oh, all right.

 D'oh.

 '[]Hey, guys, you mind if I join you? They ran out of Beaujolais Cru in the executive dining room and I ain't drinkin' white with my coq-Au-freakin'-vin.

 I think I'd rather sit somewhere else.

 Yeah, I'm gonna take my lunch back to the core.

 Now they won't even have lunch with me? Well, you know, people can kind of act like they're in grade school.

 Oh, now you gotta throw your grade school education in my face? You know, Moe, you're a real jerk! I didn't mind so much when it came with beer! I don't need youse! I'm all the company I need! Heh! Oh! Oh! I just lost my appetite.

 Marge, which can makes me look cooler-- the Drizzler or Mr.

 Drip? (Marge groans wearily) Aw, your leaves are drooping.

 Here, let me turn that gloom into bloom.

 (whimsically):  Dee-Dee, doo-doo, doo  (moaning with satisfaction) Homer Simpson! Working with those plants is great! It's helped you get in touch with your feminine side.

 Feminine?! (shrieks) I didn't mean to use that word! I-It's okay to have a feminine side! It's good, in fact.

 Oh  It was rainin' hard in Springfield   I needed one more fare to make my night   I got a push notification on my smartphone   Passenger ahead, race: white.

  Mind if we drive in silence for a bit? Whatever you want.

 (sighs heavily) (groaning dramatically)  I asked if there was somewhere I could take him   He said, "Just drive me, Lady Blue"   I said, "I've had my share of unhappy fares"   He said, "I sure miss slingin' brew.

"  Moe, I think we'd both be a lot happier if we quit our new jobs.

 You know, I think you're right there, Midge.

 I'm gonna build my bar back up, better than ever! (hearty chuckle) How hard can it be, eh? Oh, God, this is so much worse than I remember! So, you drop off your lover and go back to stealing our jobs.

 He's not my lover.

 Let the man speak! Medallions! Air fresheners! (gasping) Step away from the social-media-enabled, peer-to-peer ride share platform.

 (shouting fearfully) Now, promise me you'll leave her be and wipe down your backseats annually Aw, come on! (gunshot) Okeydoke.

 Now beat it.

 Uh, I think it might be time to hang up the old beaded seat cover, there.

 Yep.

 And I know a place that could use this smile.

 Whew! It's sure great to see you jerking our suds again, Moe.

 Yeah, I figured out that the best way for me to get along with most people is to be kept behind a two-foot trunk of solid oak.

 (chuckles) Looks more like poplar to me.

 Why, youse correcting me on my knowledge of wood products? Don't you slide me down the bar! (thudding) So good to be back.

 Oh, shut up.

 []Well, I'm back where I belong, eh? You're not alone anymore.

 What the hell was that? Oh, you'll find out.

 Shh!   


                





                    			 D'oh! (tires screeching) (grunts) (whirring) Mmm.

 Paper jam.

 Okay, Dad, I'm ready for Take Your Daughter to Work Day.

 How come there's never a Take Your Son to Work Day? 'Cause boys are already on track to get all the good jobs.

 The Dirty Dozen? All guys.

 Twelve Angry Men? Uh, men! The X-Men? Mostly men.

 (Bart and Homer laugh) Good one, Dad.

 Yeah.

 Well, despite all that, today's going to be fun, Dad! Will there be lots of other girls there? Just a few.

 For some reason, there's been a lot of infertility at the nuclear plant.

 After we show you the wealth of jobs in the steno pool, a hearty luncheon of bison with lake beaver will be served.

 GIRLS: Ew! And upon leaving, you will each receive a piece of orangewood to bite down on during childbirth.

 (chuckles) Excellent.

 (person applauds) It's getting harder and harder to maintain my sunny disposition, Smithers.

 Oh, you're always my ray of Shut up.

 Dad, what does that do? I don't know.

 Who's that guy? I don't know.

 Where do those pipes lead? Not sure.

 Is it called the cooling tower because there's Not my department.

 How many kilowatts are? Look, sweetie, would you like to go to the cafeteria and get some ice cream? How many kinds are there? Curse that Elon Musk! Thanks to that Earth-smooching buttinski, I'm on the verge of bankruptcy.

 All I have left are the clothes on my back and the clones in my freezer.

 I had to replace my beloved hounds with teacup poodles.

 It's pathetic.

 Watch.

 Release the hounds.

 (barking) (chuckling): Aw.

 No.

 Help.

 Oh, stop.

 Oh, spare me.

 And all I got from Mr.

 Musk was an electric car, which I charge by stealing power from my nosy neighbor.

 Hey, dippily-do, neighbor-oni! Stupid Branson.

 But I have a new scheme that will undo the terrible damage done by my other schemes.

 I have an appointment with a Nigerian King to negotiate a uranium deal that will put me right back on top.

 Huh.

 Nothing can stop you, sir.

 But, uh, not that you're not at the top of your game.

 Uh, what if you don't get the deal? I'll just have to sell everything and move to the South Pacific with you.

 What a grim fate that would be.

 And with your omelet, would you like the fried potatoes or the mixed berries? I'll have the berries.

 Ah.

 A terrible fate indeed, sir.

 Oh, no.

 My almond milk leaked all over everything.

 Dad, do you have anything I can eat? Hmm? Oh, uh, I will turn this corn chip into a wonderful meal, using my greatest skill-- lunchroom trading! Shut your eyes.

 ("The Thieving Magpie" by Rossini plays) Pretty impressive, Homer.

 But what about the presentation? The eyes taste first, then lips, then palette.

 Then the body's harshest critic-- the colon.

 (Rossini's "Thieving Magpie" plays) Okay, sweetie, open those baby blacks.

 (gasps) Wow, Dad.

 (giggles) Thank you.

 Ooh.

 Welcome, Your Majesty.

 Mr.

 Burns, I don't know what you have heard, but I do not eat monkey brains from a skull.

 Oh, this is for me.

 Before we begin, I have a favor to ask.

 (sucking through straw) My daughter is traveling with me.

 Hello.

 She is my true treasure.

 During our complicated negotiations, I need someone to look after her, keep her out of trouble.

 Hmm.

 That man is the perfect choice.

 What?! Sir, that's Homer Simpson.

 You forgot that he's the most incompetent (both laughing) Homer Simpson would be perfect.

 Simpson, all you have to do is babysit the princess-- keeping her in this hotel room during the negotiations.

 Babysitting, eh? What do I know about kids? Homer Simpson, I give you Princess Kemi of Nigeria! Watch that girl like a hawk.

 (screams) Princess, why'd you put on that coat? You're obviously cold.

 May I escort you to the radiator? No.

 I want to go out.

 I'm 25 years old.

 (phone ringing) Uh, just a second.

 Hey, Marge.

 Yeah, I'm working late.

 Yup, special project.

 Lenny said you were babysitting, and if you are babysitting, why can't you do some at home? I could use a night out.

 Sorry, Marge, but I am the royal babysitter.

 If I start watching commoners, the tongues of the court will be awag.

 Really? Awag? Really? Well, if you think that (beeps off) I want to go out and see the America whose greatest cities I've only seen destroyed in movies.

 I see.

 You want excitement.

 Princess, have you ever heard of Studio 54, CBGBs, the Roxbury? Yes! I've dreamed of All gone.

 But in their place, we have All awesome.

 Sit down, and I'll show you.

 So, all these concubines belong to this one tyrant? He's called "The Bachelor.

" Please let me go out.

 All right, Princess.

 I'll take you to a place that's fun with a capital "F.

" (grunting) Moe, this is Kemi.

 She's an honest-to-God princess.

 Ah, really? Hey, tell me something.

 I heard that Queen Elizabeth in person is actually not that funny.

 I am from Africa.

 Wow, Africa.

 I had a good friend who really wanted to go there.

 So, uh, you speak English there? I speak five languages.

 (sputters) Nobody does.

 (speaking Portuguese) (speaking French) (speaking Spanish) (speaking Japanese) Uh, which means what? "I don't wish to show off.

" Yeah, that's pretty good there, uh, but don't expect me to bow and scrape.

 Uh, well, I'll give you one scrape.

 Yeah, that's it, Majesty.

 Notice I didn't say "Your.

" (laughs) Oh, they don't make them like you in Nigeria.

 Nigeria? Homer, can I speak to you in private? (grunting) Can I try it? Ah, you got to be mad at something.

 Well, I'm mad I'm not doing it.

 Okay, I'll tell you why I'm mad.

 A few months back, I got an unsolicited e-mail from an actual Nigerian prince.

   The prince needed to transfer $40 million out of the country.

 He offered to split that with me if I paid the five grand for the transfer fees.

 HOMER: And you gave it to him? MOE: Yeah, I did.

 I was sure the guy was on the level because of his bad spelling and grammar.

 Now, guess how much of the $20 million I saw? $8 million? Ze-ro.

 Get out of here! If Kemi there is a Nigerian princess, her brother just might be the Nigerian prince that took my money! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Listen, Moe, I'm Kemi's guardian.

 She and I are going back to the hotel now! (gasps) She's gone! And she trashed my bar! Oh, no, wait.

 She actually cleaned up a little bit.

 Yeah, good for her.

 (panting): Chief, thank God! I was drinking at Moe's, and I lost an African princess! Lost African princess, eh? Well, lucky for you, she just happens to be in the back of my cruiser.

 Yes! The prayer I forgot to say has been answered.

 What the? You're going straight to the drunk tank, rummy.

 "African princess.

" (distant gunshots) Chief, I just saw someone robbin' the Kwik-E-Mart! Oh, now African princesses are robbing the Kwik-E-Mart, huh? Get in the car, booze bag.

 Chief, I have been shot in the shoulder! In the car! What is this, St.

 Patrick's Day? Why, this is terrible.

 Can't even think of anything to mumble to myself.

 That's how upset I am here.

 Hello.

 First of all, I wanted to pay.

 Also maybe I wanted to talk more to you? Really? Okay there, Moe, you got to get to the brother, because he knows what my PIN number is, and I forgot.

 Yeah, duly noted.

 Uh, so, Your Tootsieness, tell me about your family.

 Got any aunts, uncles, cousins, sisters brothers? I have a brother.

 Yes.

 One.

 I see.

 Now, Moe, don't jump to conclusions.

 A lot of people have brothers.

 Does he have a computer? Yes.

 MOE: It's him! HOMER: Guys, thanks for bailing me out, but I still have a huge problem.

 Well, till we find her, maybe we could get somebody to pretend to be her.

 You know, get a nice wig and a dress.

 Oh, no, I am not dressing up like an African princess.

 I am not! I am not! I am not! Thank you for listening to my objections.

 Well, you were really vehement.

 (phone ringing) Uh, hello, Simpson.

 Just checking up.

 May I speak with the princess? Um, yeah, sure.

 Uh (high-pitched Southern accent): Hello, this is the princess.

 I'm with Homer Simpson, and I do declare he's wonderful.

 Oh, that's right, I'm from South Africa.

 Fiddle-Dee-Dee.

 (laughing): Well, sounds like everything's going just the way I want it.

 Yeah, so all my money's tied up in this "jernt.

" Can't even afford elocution lessons to teach me how to pronounce "joint.

" I guess I could do it online, but, uh, what's the "pernt"? (laughs) What-What's so funny? I thought my English was perfect, but you make me feel even better about it.

 (chuckles) Eh, usually people that tease me get thrown out on their ass.

 But, uh, your sayin' it made me feel good.

 Geez, I sound like one of those guys in them Rom coms that play at the theaters next to the theater I'm in.

 Heh.

 So, uh, what's a "princessess" like you, uh, do all day, huh? A lot of spinning wheels and witches treating you like crap? I read.

 Are you familiar with the books by my countryman Chinua Achebe, Things Fall Apart and No Longer At Ease? Hey, you guys got real optimistic literature there.

 (giggles) Fair comment.

 (yawns) I haven't eaten all day.

 Well, don't eat those eggs! Uh, we don't know what kind of bird they turn into.

 But there's a string cheese or something in the fridge in the back.

 Uh, help yourself.

 All right, after she eats, I'd better close up.

 (yawns) Oh.

 Come on, pal.

 (grunts) Come on.

 That's really stuck there good.

 Ah, I can't be mad at her no more.

 Good night, moon.

 Good night, broom.

 Good night, jukebox that won't play a tune.

 Good night, eggs.

 Good night, dregs.

 Good night, bugs crawlin' up my legs.

 Good night, beer.

 Good night, mice.

 Good night, princess who treats me nice.

 Yeah.

 (yawns) So my offer for one ton of your uranium is a goat.

 Will you stop offering me that? I come from a modern nation of 90 million people.

 Two goats.

 You are starting to insult me.

 All right, let's cut to the chase.

 My board has given me permission to go up to 12 goats.

 (grumbles) How about here, sir? Looks good to me.

 I'm so sorry I pretended not to be gay for all those years.

 Well, better an old queen than never a queen at all.

 (chuckles) Pay attention.

 My last offer: Okay, but no dogs disguised as goats.

 Oh, great, here comes the haggling.

 Well, well, look who's up.

 Heh.

 Uh, Princess, I'm gonna do something for you I've never done for anyone in this bar.

 Call you a cab.

 No.

 I want to spend time with you.

 I want to see this town.

 Do you mind ridin' a cute little scooter with your arms around my waist? I don't.

 To the scooter store.

   And after you eat the soup you can eat the bowl or you can put "kerns" in it.

 What, uh, whatever you like.

 I have a confession to make.

 This is my first montage.

 Just relax and enjoy the music.

 Moe Szyslak.

 This is the part of the fairy tale where the princess goes back to the hotel and watches TV.

 Come with me.

 So where are we headed, dude? Just go and go fast.

 Okay, um, usually I do kind of a funny take on an airline pilot greeting the passengers.

 You know, like, "Hey.

 Thank you "for flying Air Kevin.

 If you look out to the left of the pedicab, you" Just move the pedals.

 Whoa, sounds like the tower has cleared us for takeoff.

 We're tryin' to escape that guy.

 Well, dude, as long as he can run, he can beat us.

 D'oh! So, anyways, the place that I really feel the pedaling? It's my legs.

 Okay, all right, we're safe.

 Actually, I wanted to go back with him.

 I don't want to get my father mad, O.

 Go back? But I didn't show you the place where Dave Grohl got mugged.

 I have to leave, but I still had a wonderful day.

 MOE: Thank God I shaved my forehead this morning.

 (gasps) A paparazzo.

 Please don't send that.

 If my father sees it, it will ruin my life.

 Well, thanks for making it so easy.

 And you have the 20 million goats? Two, now.

 on delivery.

 Very good.

 Um, shouldn't we see how the princess is doing before you sign, Your Majesty? What are you talking about, Smithers? (phone dings) (gasps) I can't even trust you to watch an impetuous adult who does what she wants.

 The deal is off.

 SMITHERS: Wow.

 After spending my life serving others, I'm finally gonna get what I want.

 Uh, uh, sir, there may be a bright side.

 There's never a bright side.

 SMITHERS (chuckles): He's almost mine.

 Yes, you've torn that up, all right.

 Father, I want to explain.

 I was a young woman who wanted to see the world, and this kind man has shown it to me.

 And stolen your heart.

 Eh, well, that's what I do.

 Uh, sorry, but there ain't no off switch for this.

 (laughs) He has not stolen my heart.

 Wha?! Why has he made the ancient tribal sound of confusion? I think he is a sweet, sweet man.

 But when I kissed him on the forehead, it was not romantic.

 More like when Snow White kissed Dopey.

 Oh, no, no, not this comparison again.

 I'm sorry, Moe.

 I don't love you.

 But I really like you.

 Well, daughter, even though you have done nothing seriously wrong, first I will tear this contract one more time.

 (grunts) And as for you, your punishment will be Uh, may I speak to you, Majesty, father to father? A woman has allowed you to sire her children? There was beer involved.

 I have two daughters.

 And I've learned you have to let them go their own way.

 Even the one-year-old.

 Majesty.

 And the older one, I can't tell her what to do.

 And she's only 12.

 Eight.

 See what I mean? Always an argument.

 But the thing you have to remember is that you have to let them be who they are because you love them.

 I am not convinced.

 Uh, because you want them to grow.

 Still not convinced.

 And because you can't strangle a girl.

 That makes sense.

 Oh Come here, daughter.

 Oh, father.

 Little girl, let me give you some advice.

 Never dream big, because it will blow up in your face.

 You're talking to the girl who wants a career in jazz.

 Oh, poor thing.

 So the good king's cheap uranium will allow me to sell you expensive nuclear power.

 Everyone wins.

 Yes, yes.

 Princess.

 Can you tell us about the man you kissed? MOE: Uh, yeah, I'll field that.

 Uh, yesterday, a local man "may or may not" have given a tour to a certain princess, who, uh, one assumes, turned all his thoughts of revenge to love and then love to respect.

 And yesterday, a certain princess may or may not have seen much of your world with a certain man, and she certainly might be eternally grateful.

 Oh, this is vague stuff.

 Vague stuff! I did not think this through.

 Moe, before I left, I just wanted to give you these examples of our most beloved, albeit depressing, literature.

 Ah, some nice bedtime readin'.

 Fun premise.

 I'm laughing already.

 Really not cheerin' me up here, but, uh, let me offer you the only literature in this bar-- sure works for me, though.

 This coaster.

 I will treasure it.

 Well, I guess you'll pine forever for a man who doesn't care, while I just grow old here in this bar.

 Yeah.

 Here's to suffering in silence.

 Oh.

 Mm.

 Can't wait to see those numbers hanging from my rafters.

 (sighs) I can't believe it's been three years since Smithers left.

 Man, have I been aging badly.

 But I guess I can finally wash this forehead.

 Oh, divine.

 (doorbell ringing) Oh, God, what do you want? Well, neighbor, now that your streak of rum luck is at its end, I have a favor to ask.

 It involves charity.

 I've set up the Virgin Earth Challenge, a $25 million prize to eliminate greenhouse gases, that I was hoping you would add to.

 Where are the hounds when I need them? They're on a free Virgin Galactic flight around the world.

 Can you go five blasted minutes without saying the word "virgin"? That's another Virgin Challenge.

 That I will not be Virgin taking.

 Virgin.

 Shh!   


                





                    			 (snoring) Chief, there's a sniper down in the warehouse district! Let's roll! Sniper? Ah, um, well, you know how I love to roll, but, uh, my wife ordered a new dust ruffle for our bedroom, and, uh, she had it shipped to the station.

 If I'm not here to sign for it, they'll take it back to the package place, and that is a whole nightmare.

 Love you guys.

 (sighs) (grunts) (sighs) Uh, yeah, I got a delivery here for, uh, Clancy Wiggins.

 "Wiggins"? N-N-No, it's Wiggum.

 Wiggins? That's not even a real name.

 What's a Wiggins? No, really, tell me.

 Wh-What is that? Okay, so you're not Clancy Wiggins who ordered this, uh, Skymaster X5000 Jet Pack.

 Jet pack? Of course I'm Clancy Wiggins, you idiot! "Chief Clancy Jetpack.

" Wow.

 Well, boys, justice has a new name-- up.

 Uh, Chief, it says here you need to take a 40-hour training course and get certified before you can legally I'm not the police anymore.

 I'm the Sky Police.

 (grunts) Okay, okay.

 I think I got it.

 No, I got it, I got it.

 WIGGUM (to tune of "Baby Face"):  Sky Police   Chief Clancy Wiggins is the Sky Police   A floating future cop, Sky Police   Fly, police   Squash perps on their heads   They won't know why they're dead   Sky Police   In my jet pack, I'm flying high above the law   I'm just like Superman   Powered by great big fans   I'll kill you all   I'm Sky Police.

  Ugh, why don't you take that thing off, Chief? It's starting to smell.

 What, so you can steal it and be Sky Police? Oh, no.

 No way.

 I'm Brigadier General Clancy Wiggins.

 Apparently a military-issue jet pack was mistakenly delivered here while I received this off-brand dust ruffle.

 Um oh.

 Well, there's only one floating future cop who can find that missing jet pack-- the Sky Police.

  This is the end of Sky Police.

  (screams) You were the wind beneath my ass.

 Stupid church.

 Why would Jesus want us to waste our weekend on extra boring, no-recess, dress-up school? Exactly.

 The dude was a carpenter.

 And those guys like to kick back on Sundays.

 (chuckles) And I mean kick back.

 Guys, church is good for your souls.

 And remember, God is listening to your prayers.

 What percentage of prayers really come true? Well, not all of them.

 Like, um, 90%? God doesn't hear my prayers.

 If he did, I'd be at home on the couch playing video games in a diaper.

 Oh, God gets your prayers, but he just clicks delete without reading them, like e-mail updates from LinkedIn.

 I hope no one was hurt.

 So no church? (gasps) My prayers were answered.

 (sighs) Boom.

 Don't worry, Reverend, according to your policy, your church is covered for everything but acts of God.

 But we believe everything that happens everywhere is an act of God.

 My jiminy, you're right! We're off the hook! Hey! Those Cornell men at the head office are gonna be doing the Saluki Strut tonight! Go Southern Illinois! ALL: Saluki Strut! So we have no money to repair the church.

 And developers are itching to build on our land.

 Fast-casual dining downstairs, live-work lofts upstairs, and as an anchor store-- a chain pharmacy.

 (gasping) Why, it's a mixed-use nightmare! This building is the heart of our community.

 We have our weddings here, our funerals.

 Our fun runs begin and end here.

 I will not rest until it is rebuilt.

 I can't believe it, but the church is going to have to ask people for money.

 Who keeps putting pickle slices in here? I think I can help you get the money that you need.

 But you don't go to our church.

 Granted, I do not share your faith, but the yahoos in this town need a church to deliver weekly reminders not to steal-- from me.

 And not to take a life-- my life.

 Yar, without organized religion, I've lost me moral compass.

 Also I've, uh, I've been addicted to Oxy for a while now yar.

 Yar.

 Now, this is what I have got in mind.

 I will whisper even though we are alone.

 All right, people, Marge has brought this heathen to aid us in our time of need.

 Please do not call me a heathen.

 It offends Hanuman, the monkey-headed lord of winds, who believed the sun to be a ripe mango Okay, I get it, I get why you say it.

 Apu thinks we can get the money at the casino playing blackjack.

 (gasping) The casino?! Blackjack's for suckers.

 My brother? He used to own three Arby's franchises.

 Lost 'em all at the tables and gave himself a shotgun tonsillectomy.

 But you told me Uncle Stevie moved to Okinawa.

 What I told you was to wait in the car.

 No, no, you can beat the house.

 By counting cards.

 I myself have done it-- when I was a student at MIT, the Mumbai Institute of Tantric Sex, where I was recruited by a card-counting ring.

 I won enough money to buy fake SAT scores I used to get into the real MIT, where I failed every class and was kicked out and had to move to Springfield.

 Mm-hmm.

 Mmm.

 Am I hearing this right? Is the church council truly considering gambling? You know, Ned, the Bible never explicitly condemns gambling.

 Biblical folks were always playing games of chance, like, uh, drawing lots.

 (gasps) Leviticus drew lots.

 Joshua drew lots, Nehemiah.

 Even the apostles were lot-drawers.

 (gasps) If gambling's okay, then I'm getting health insurance for the kids.

 Card counting is not gambling.

 It is math.

 And it's not even against the rules.

 Exactly.

 If you are caught, you cannot be charged with any crime.

 The worst they will do is beat you with a phone book or break some fingers.

 But what is a little pain if your church is to be saved? It is all good.

 Counting cards requires absolute focus.

 You must ignore all casino distractions.

 (slot machines ringing over stereo) (all coughing) And beware of cocktail waitresses with free drinks and eyeball-height cleavage.

 They're not attractive, but you cannot look away.

 Freshen your drink, hon? Who had the Scotch and soda? Cocktails.

 Cocktails.

 Another one, hon? You, what is the count?! (stammers) Get your head in the game, Mel! Now remember, for this legal- but-frowned-upon scheme to work, we must have complete secrecy.

 Do not tell anyone what you are doing.

 Not even Homer? (sighs) Homer is many things but not a good accomplice.

 If he gets involved and this scheme fails, what happens to our church? (dance music plays) (all groan) Oh, even I saw that.

 I guess I can't tell Homer.

 I'm leaving for my fund-raising meeting.

 Don't wait up.

 Why are you church-Os getting together so late? I'm asking because I'm supposed to care about things.

 Well, to raise money, we're putting on a revue.

 Well, you can't go wrong with a revue.

 Skits and songs? (chuckles) I'm entertained already.

 Yeah, so, uh I'm going out to rehearse the revue.

 Go.

 Go make magic.

 You just go.

 (chuckles) Revue.

 APU: Card counting is simple.

 All sit at different tables, betting low, playing hand after hand, counting in your head how many high cards are left in the deck.

 Ignore all distractions.

 (stammering) When the count is high, you have a "hot deck," and the odds are in your favor.

 Then you use a secret signal to call in "the Closer.

" The Closer bets big, wins bigger, and the casino never suspects that it has been the victim of a morally acceptable screw job.

 But use caution-- there are eyes everywhere.

 Sooner or later, the casino will catch on.

 And that is when you must flash the "get the hell out" signal.

 LOVEJOY: What a haul.

 MARGE: Ooh.

 One more night like this, and we'll be able to fix the church in style.

 What a rush-- it got my blood pumping in a way I thought only quiet reflection could.

 Fizzy water for everyone.

 I think we can do something a little harder than that.

 Mmm! Now, that's a marshmallow-y s'more-garita.

 Homer, Homer, we did it.

 (mumbling): Wh-What'd you do? We're going to save the church.

 I feel like celebrating.

 B-But but it's not on the calendar.

 Okay, but if I'm sleepy at work tomorrow, I get to tell everyone why.

 Oh, boy, oh, boy.

 and 2:00 a.

m.

 steak? Night-marriage rules! (sighs) I guess nothing gets the heart pumping like a church revue.

 Huh? Oh, yeah.

 Yeah, yeah, the revue.

 Oh, I got so many questions.

 What are the skits about? Uh, pop culture and current events.

 How do you transition between scenes? Hard blackouts or spotlight fades? Uh, both.

 Nice.

 You know, it wouldn't be a revue without songs.

 Tell me about one.

 Okay, uh, there's a song about, um how Democrats and Republicans can't get along.

 It's called, "Cats and Dogs.

" (laughing): Oh.

 You got yourself one hell of a show, Marge.

 One hell of a show.

 (sighs) Okay, okay, don't get cocky, you rapture-waiting baby-baptizers.

 You had one good night, but now the casino is on to you.

 They're not going to let you anywhere near those blackjack tables, unless you wear these.

 MARGE: Disguises? I'm worried our scam is becoming dishonest.

 Relax, Marge.

 If God lets the Jews have Sunday on a Saturday, he'll be cool with this.

 Why, I bet the Lord is pleased as punch that we're using that dirty casino money to rebuild his temple.

 Our mission is LOVEJOY: Where has this been all my life? (Helen and Mrs.

 Skinner moan) I could be Sideshow anyone.

 I'm telling Mom about how the school freezer broke, and they had to cook all the Tater Tots, and the teachers took the extra Tots home in manila envelopes.

 I'm telling her! You never let me tell.

 Mom, the freezer broke and Cooked all the Tater Tots, Cooked all the Tater Tots.

 and there were too many Tots, Too many Tots.

 and there were manila envelopes, Manila envelopes.

 and the teachers took them home BOTH: I hate you! MARGE: Okay, Mel.

 I'll be at the casino by 10:00.

 Meet me at the lounge by the J.

 Geils cover band.

 Mom, why are you going to a casino? Are you a hostess? Actually, my friends and I are using a system to win money to save the church.

 I can't believe you're gambling.

 It's not gambling.

 It's math.

 Is Dad in on this takedown? It's not a takedown.

 And I haven't told him about it.

 Yet.

 But it's okay for you guys to know because you're finally grown-up enough to be trusted with adult information.

 Yeah, we are grown-up.

 I know how much to tip a waiter.

 I go on hikes with my friends where we talk about our problems.

 I'll tell your dad everything in the morning when we have the money.

 But until then, I appreciate you keeping this very grown-up secret.

 (sighs)   Dump that money on the bed.

 I'm taking a Franklin bath.

 (imitates gargles, laughs) Yeah Dear Lord, thank you for granting us the gift of rationalization to allow us to scheme and swindle so that we might honor you.

 Amen.

 MARGE: Homie.

 Homie, I can finally tell you how we really got the money.

 (chuckles) Homie? (phone rings) Uh, Marge? Some casino guys have me, and they want the money you took from them or else.

 (gasps) This is all my fault.

 Just tell me one thing, Marge.

 Why did you lose faith in the revue? I mean, "Cats and Dogs" writes itself.

  Cats and dogs on Capitol Hill   They don't get along and never will   Cats and dogs, squabbles never ending   Even with so much legislation pending.

  Homie, how did you end up at the casino? Well, I was taking a moment to enjoy my after-dinner night cap Dad, Mom trusted us with a secret.

 But she hasn't come home yet, and we're worried she's in trouble.

 (burping): What?! BOTH: Mom's counting cards at the casino! Oh, if anything happens to Marge, (gasps) we'll all be orphans! (gasping) I'm coming for you, baby.

 Have you seen this woman? Have you? Have you seen my wife? This is your wife? Do you know where she is? Uh, we'd like to ask you some questions in our "beating room.

" All right, as long as it's just questions.

 Reverend! Reverend! They took Homer! Why are you still dressed like that? Um, well (chuckles nervously) HELEN: Oh, Asphodel Your corpse bride is getting cold.

 Uh, one second, Belladonna.

 Helen and I have found that, uh, these new personas have been quite liberating.

 Was that a woman's voice? Send her in.

 (throws up) If we don't give back the money we won counting cards, the casino people are going to hurt Homer.

 Okay, uh Tiny snafu.

 I've already given the money to the contractor.

 Then we'll just have to ask that contractor to give the money back.

 (laughs) Give the money back? (laughs) Hey, Jerry, Th-they want the money back.

 La dama azul quiere devolver El dinero.

 (all laughing) Are you gonna put my head in a vice? We don't do that-- we don't even have a vice.

 We just want the money your wife stole from us.

 Stole? How is counting cards stealing? Well, it's not really stealing.

 Is it even cheating? No, but it's just not allowed.

 I don't get it.

 Football players can do the quarterback sneak and baseball players can steal bases.

 Why can't I just remember which cards have been played? I can't take any more of this guy.

 Get the vice! I knew you had a vice.

 I knew it.

 (grunting): I knew it.

 I knew it.

 I'm sorry, Marge.

 Maybe your husband's suffering was all part of God's plan.

 God's plan? God isn't some video gamer up there controlling us like we were Pac-Men and Dig Dugs.

 God isn't Sky Police.

 God didn't do this.

 I lied to my husband.

 And made my kids lie, too.

 We did this.

 She's right.

 We thought we could enter the den of sin and emerge unscathed, but we were scathed.

 Those free ginger ales at the casino, I-I didn't declare them on my taxes.

 (grunts) I'm going to do what I should have done in the first place.

 Put on a revue? (grunts) (groans) MARGE: Dear Lord, I don't have anywhere to pray anymore, so I've come to your new temple-- here.

 Um, I don't know if you watch us all the time, or if we're just like an ant farm you got for your birthday and left on the shelf, and every once in a while, you check out what kind of crazy tunnels we've built.

 Maybe we got it all wrong, praying for you to give us things we selfishly want.

 Maybe prayer is just taking a moment to tell yourself that there is good in the universe.

 And I'm going to sit here and focus on that good, and maybe, just maybe, I'll get my husband back.

 (gasps) I'm Doug Blattner, COO of the gaming and resorts division of Stuffers Italian Foods.

 My family loves your microwave lasagnas.

 It's not my division, but I'll tell Bill Kelley you said so.

 Your unsanctioned religious gathering has caused a marked decrease in gambling activities.

 HPMs are down that's hands per minute.

 IAMs, GDCs-- they're all down.

 I want my husband back.

 Hmm, let me run it by Jennifer Yang.

 Oh, wait, she's on maternity leave.

 Don't worry-- I'm sure Chuck Bennett will sign off on it.

 We are going to release your husband.

 See, Marge, someone up in the sky did hear your prayers.

 They sure did-- casino management.

 (grunts) You are free to leave as long as your faith-based card-counting group never return to this or any other river or maritime casino.

 No deal! But we don't need to come back.

 We saved the church.

 No! An injustice has gone on here for too long! I'm not leaving this casino until you stop punishing people for counting cards.

 They're just playing the game by the rules.

 (people cheer) (shouts) Homie, after all this, do you still believe in God? On a beautiful night like tonight, how could I not? LOU: Next week on Sky Police (chuckles)   "Sky police" Shh!   


                





                    			 (humming) D'oh! (tires screeching) (grunts) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) Huh? Ay, caramba! (chuckles) I haven't ridden a bike since Lance Armstrong was a good guy.

 Geez, Lis, you're riding the girliest bike in the world.

 Ooh, I stand corrected.

 (hums) Hey, dipwad, bikes only.

 I need to pay my water bill.

 Not on motorized transport, you don't.

 What you need to get is out of our way.

 Yeah, bikes win again! (train toots) Trains win again! When will you people give up your dependence on handlebars? Quite a Schwinn-dig, eh? Shut up, biking Flanders.

 (bicycle bell dings) Chief, no, don't go in the doughnut shop! Your pants are too tight! Oh, I'm just gonna eat one little Drinkers, if you go on the wagon, make sure it's the Duff Beer Wagon.

 Oh, yeah! Duffman, how about a 21-thrust salute to America's military? My hips are proud to honor our endless war.

 One, two, three (cracking) Ow, God! Something's wrong with Barry.

 Never use my mortal name in public.

 I have very troubling news.

 (chuckles) Duffman is undergoing hip replacement surgery.

 Now, Barry will be fine, but as of this moment there is no Duffman.

 (gasping) They came for Joe Camel, and I said nothing.

 They came for the Frito Bandito, and still I said nothing.

 So what are you saying now? About what? (humming) (groans) (humming) KENT BROCKMAN: Duffman, the man, has retired.

 But Duffman, the idea, endures.

 Authorities are unsure whether the empty bottles are a beautiful tribute or just drunks too lazy to find a trash can.

 Either way, the Duff Corporation announces an open televised competition to find out who will be the next Duffman.

 In other news, the Chinese land on Mars.

 Also, no more elephants.

 Now, for more cool, refreshing news Marge, what would you think if I tried out to be Duffman? I know why you want to be Duffman.

 It's so you can drink free beer and get shnockered all day.

 Sure, I admit I get "shnockered" once in a while.

 I might have been "lacquered" from time to time.

 I may have, how you say, had a subconjunctival hemorrhage.

 (chuckles) But this isn't about that.

 Then what is this about? Marge, if I died today, the obituary would read, "H.

 Simpson, father of three, extra pallbearers needed.

" Being Duffman would give me another line.

 Okay, sweetie, you can try.

 Great, but it won't be easy.

 I got to start practicing now.

 Oh, yeah.

 Oh, yeah.

 Oh, yeah.

 Ow! (theme music playing) ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, your hostess, the inescapable Cat Deeley.

 Are you ready to find out who will be America's next Duffman? Yes, Cat, yes! A million times, yes! America's next Duffman will be selected by the planet's foremost experts in the field of party starting-- best-selling electronica artist, Der Zip Zorp.

 Former Duff Girl and current senator from Oklahoma, the Honorable Missy LeBeau.

 I look reasonable, but I'm not.

 And billionaire Mumbai entrepreneur, Rajneesh Superstar.

 Bottle service, ballers! (audience cheers) Now let's welcome the Chairman of Duff Industries, Mr.

 H.

K.

 Duff VII.

 Thank you, Cat.

 I just want to say, if we can't find ourselves a Duffman out of this group, then maybe we'll just give up on the concept.

 Brilliant! Now, let's find our Duffman.

  I'm coming up   So you better get this party started   I'm coming up  Oh, yeah! My two favorite words aside from "Seacrest passed," can I get an "Oh, yeah"? Oh, ja.

 (crowd jeering) Oh, yes.

 (jeering) Ach.

 NELSON: Haw-haw.

  Vo-de-oh-doh-doh.

  (jeering) Oh, yeah! (crowd cheering)  I'm coming up   So you better get this party started   I'm coming up   So you better get  Did you miss me? Like Mexico misses California.

 It's down to two.

 And before revealing our results, former Duffman, Barry Huffman, is here to wish you luck.

 I was told there would be morphine.

 Oh, yeah.

 Homer, any last thoughts on what Duff means to you? Without Duff, I wouldn't have have brought three beautiful children into the world.

 That's right, man.

 We're beer babies.

 AUDIENCE: Aw (groans) The judges are conferring.

 (discussing) We have our decision.

 Karma is in the house, dawg! Homer, your words were beautiful.

 That is exactly why you're America's Next Top Duffman runner-up! (cheers) (groans) The real winner is America's new hero-- contestant number 12! (dance music playing) (making alarmed computer noises) What is it, Der Zip Zorp? Olde Ogdenville Ale? He drinks a competitor.

 Reverse the confetti.

 And check the fat guy for tattoos.

 Just one that says "Marge Madness.

" These reality shows really leave you no privacy.

 Well, I guess that makes this guy Duffman.

 Ooh, ooh, ooh, do I get the confetti?! One confettus.

 Ow! I mean (whoops) I mean, oh, yeah!   (squawking) (squawks) That's how we'll tell the trades you got the job.

 Seems awfully overproduced.

 Just take the oath.

 Night gathers, and now my Duff watch begins.

 It shall not end until my death.

 Or my 13-week option is not picked up.

 I shall take no wife, hold no lands, and father no children, except for the wife and house and kids I'm already stuck with.

 I shall wear no other beer's crowns.

 I am the six-pack hidden in Daddy's secret cabinet.

 I put the "fest" in Oktoberfest and sell for eight bucks at ballparks, though I have nothing to offer but my suds, head and beers, and promotional cozies, for this night and all the nights to come.

 MAN: When life looks hopeless, it's not.

  Duff Beer, feeling no pain   Made from Canadian rain   Tastes like nickel champagne   It will tickle your brain   Duff Beer, feeling no pain   Made from Canadian rain.

  And here's a painting of my ancestor Ichabod Duff, crossing the Duffaware River.

 Ah, hell, this is all BS.

 Duffman was a fascist icon my grandfather repurposed 'cause he couldn't get the damn rights to Woody Woodpecker.

 Mr.

 Duff, can I ask what's in this safe? Little lady, inside that safe is the formula for Duff itself, known only to three people-- me, Condoleezza Rice, and my brother-in-law Terry.

 And the combination is not known to any human Uh, what the? "Schlitz plus water.

" Why don't you kids run off and play in the bottle cap pit? Don't cut yourselves! Mr.

 Duff, I want to say something.

 I'm proud of my husband, but I'm not sure if this is something Homie should be doing.

 Just what do you mean? Well, aren't you making him a superhero so that beer looks cool to kids? (laughs) Uh, Marge, let me tell you a little something about beer.

 Do you know why man stopped running around, lassoing mastodons, and became civilized? No.

 So he could grow hops and make beer.

 It's true.

 Oh.

 Our beer has helped people celebrate weddings.

 Enjoy a good game.

 Ease the pain of a lost loved one.

 That's the tradition your husband will inherit.

 Geez, now you make me want to drink it.

 Attagirl, have a designer bag.

 Now, Homer, there is one thing we needed to do in private.

 Okay, what? Ow! Hey, that's not my butt! We've injected a chip in you that detects the slightest presence of alcohol in your blood.

 You see, Duffman cannot drink.

 (laughing): What? That's funny.

 I thought you just said that Duffman can't drink.

 (laughs) But that would be crazy.

 They all fight it at first.

 (laughs) You wouldn't tell Batman he couldn't eat bats.

 When you're Duffman, you're at work, Homer.

 You wouldn't go to the nuclear plant drunk, would you? Uh Well, uh My husband won't have any problem not drinking.

 Yeah The only reason he wanted to become Duffman was to be respected and beloved.

 Uh And what better way to do that than to be stone-cold sober? (moans) When my husband put on that costume, he didn't just put on a sleeveless shirt that says "Duff" on it and a cape for some reason, he put on responsibility.

 And boots that I don't think will hold up in the rain.

 But the point is-- it's not about being drunk, it's about being someone.

 You're right, Marge.

 I will do something no one has ever done-- be fun sober.

 What a crisp and refreshing attitude.

 Hey, this stuff is pretty good.

 Mmm, foamy Marge.

 (babbling) Uh, that's the chip.

 No drinking.

 I was licking my wife.

 Can you believe they put a chip in my arm, and I can't drink beer? Ah.

 Ah, gee, tough break.

 Maybe Moe could dig it out with a corkscrew.

 Yeah.

 Oh, I would love that, Homer, I really would.

 But then Duff might take away my neon sign, and, uh, it's the only thing lighting the bar.

 BARNEY: Whoa, creepy.

 (Bart and Lisa laugh mischievously) Stop shooting those at each other.

 Relax, honey, no one's ever been killed by a T-shirt cannon.

 Oh, no, it's the 5:00 blahs.

 CLOCKS: Blah, blah, blah, blah.

 Help us, Duffman! (laughs heroically) (screams) Drink Duff! (crowd cheers) Care to team up with Fruit Batman? I'm thinking of dumping Kid Sourpuss here.

 I'm a hero.

 Oh, I can see my obituary now.

 Wow.

 Wow.

 COMMENTATOR: Watkins putting for the championship.

 It's breaking towards the hole.

 Time to move from the links to the drinks! (cheering) Well, if you guys like commercials, you're gonna love this.

 Wait, we never said we liked commercials.

  Drink, drink   Let the toast start   May young hearts never part   Drink, drink, drink   Let every true lover salute his sweetheart   Drink, drink, drink to  H.

K.

, this new Duffman is driving sales straight up.

 Turns out, men like men who look worse than them selling them beer.

 Why did it take us 142 years to discover this? Because executives are incompetent, sir? Well, then why do I have so many? Studies show when a decision is made by a group, everyone feels more confident, even though the decision could be incredibly stupid.

 Is this true? (affirming) Can't argue with that.

 What do you guys think? (affirming) Did I hear a no from section C-72? Oh, uh, no, that was a, uh, "whoa!" (chuckling): Oh.

 Give the whole lower bowl a raise.

 Uh, welcome aboard, Duffman.

 Fair warning now-- at the end, I just might ask for an autograph for my son.

 Here you go-- they're all pre-signed.

 With nicknames.

 Buddy, Sport, Tiger, Red.

 Uh, give me a "Red.

" I'll start calling him that now, and then give it to him on his birthday.

 Now, where to, sir? Oh, this is a romantic night.

 How about everywhere? All right.

 Navigator, set a course for everywhere.

 Where the hell is that? I said everywhere! Now, Homer, look through the beeriscope, and gaze upon the wonderful world that you and Duff have created.

 Captain, it never dawned on me beer could have such a dark side.

 You must be talking about new Duff Stout.

 Take us down.

 I have to think.

 To be honest, you said you wanted to go everywhere.

 So we ran out of fuel an hour ago, but I didn't want to disappoint you, so I will toss down a tow rope.

 Hey, come here.

 Man Uh this is not good.

 (sighs) Marge, do you ever worry that you made a giant mistake in your life? Oh, um I need a little context.

 Not drinking beer has given me the clearness of mind to realize drinking beer is bad.

 I've got to undo what I've done.

 Hey, how you doing? Is this the most outrageous party you've ever been to? (cheering, affirming) Well, guess what.

 You've all been served nothing but nonalcoholic Duff.

 (spectators gasping) BARNEY: Then why am I throwing up right now? As Duffman, I had the power to switch the beer trucks working this race.

 (screams) So you see, you don't need beer to have a good time.

 Join Duffman today in saying, "I've had enough of that life-ruining Duff!" Why the hell did you do this? Because Duffman is a hero.

 And with great taste comes great responsibility.

 Well, "hero," here come your fans.

 (shouting indistinctly) (yelps) (engine starts) So long, suckers! (laughing maniacally) What the?! So long, suckers! (Homer laughing maniacally) What the?! It's a circle.

 So the answer is-- go in reverse.

 So long, suckers.

 (Homer laughing maniacally) What the?! I'm not sure how many more times we can watch Dad chased down by an angry crowd before it affects us psychologically.

 As a family therapist, I can assure you that you have all the coping skills you need.

 Why is Lisa talking to an empty seat? See you next Tuesday, Dr.

 Schulman.

 Oh, right.

 You're in Maui.

 (whimpers) Hey, my beer.

 (screams) (panting frantically) (gargling) Get him back in uniform.

 Hmm.

 Homer, now, listen to me.

 You're in a stadium surrounded by people who want to kill you.

 They don't have the guts.

 Ow.

 Now, there's one way out of your hell.

 Prove you still love beer.

 Drink this with gusto.

 B-But the chip.

 There never was a chip.

 It was all the power of suggestion.

 You tricked me! And I trusted you after you snuck up and injected me without my consent.

 Just drink the beer, pretty boy.

 Whatever you do, you'll be my hero.

 Now you're pushing it.

 Homie, it's time to go.

 Come on, come on.

 Give me the beer inside you! This place seems even sadder than before.

 Uh, yeah, well, I kind of gloomed it up a little while you were gone.

 Nothing to see here, sunshine.

 (sighs) (slurring): H-Hey, y-you used to be Duffman.

 Can I get a picture with you? (gasps) I finally made it.

 I'm a has-been.

 Yeah, I guess you're right.

 Ah, let's make it official, eh? Aw Oh, yeah.

 Oh, yeah.

 Oh, yeah.

 Oh, yeah.

 Sir, may I interest you in a French hazelnut latte and an Iggy Azalea CD? I'm not here for three-buck coffee.

 I'm here to ask you to be Duffman again.

 And to use the bathroom.

 I don't know what you're talking about, sir.

 Fine, can you tell me where your travel mugs are? Yeah, over there.

 Come on, Barry, I know it's you.

 Sorry, H.

K.

, I traded in my beer goggles for coffee-grinding pince-Nez.

 Are you telling me you don't miss the big time? The girls on the side, the corporate jet? There's talk of an animated series.

 Duffman would like a job where he could phone it in.

 You just called yourself Duffman.

 Duffman never took off his tights! Let's go, girls! But we're managers here.

 They learned the register better than me! Oh, yeah! I see it as kind of a-a triumph of-of doing your work from that very pure place of-of just doing stuff that you, uh, personally enjoy.

 Shh!   


                





                    			 (Marge groaning) D'oh! (tires screeching) (grunts) (sizzling, popping) (groans) Excuse me? I'm having trouble with the on-off button on my phone.

 Okay, let me check your settings, your photos.

 I don't see why you need to do that.

 Wow, that guy's really fat.

 That's my husband! Oh! Let me talk to another salesman.

 Oh, I'm not a salesman.

 I'm just a guy in a blue shirt.

 Oh! Okay, Maggie, from now on, we only talk to people at stores with name tags.

 I've said it before, but this time, I mean it.

 (tires screech) (gasps) What happened? Oh, someone snuck into the construction site, stole a bulldozer and went joyriding all over town.

 (cat meows) Don't worry.

 I have a suspect.

 Ha! (gasps) I can't stand to see anything suffer.

 Now I've got everything I need to convict your boy, except for motive, means and opportunity.

 You also have no evidence.

 That's implied! So, I'm remanding him Is that a word-- "remanding"? Yeah, uh, to your custody.

 Maybe a mother can find out what a police chief can't.

 (phone chimes) Hmm? What? Oh! Let's go.

 Monarch butterfly, earwig, roly-poly, doodlebug, beer cap, ant, beer bottle, Barney.

 All right, I'm on a list! (dog barking) (gasps) Flanders got a new dog! (barking) Aw, what's her name? Mahershalalhasbaz.

 We just call her Baz.

 Now it's time for her Christian doggy training.

 This will be interesting.

 Sit.

 Kneel.

 Pray.

 Play dead.

 Now resurrect.

 And sit in glory at the right hand of Todd.

 Finally, a religion that makes sense.

 All right, Mr.

 Smarty, what went on back there? Mom, why is it the only time you call me smart is when you're being sarcastic? Really? Do I do that? Because I really shouldn't.

 You're the one in trouble here, bub! Why don't you think about what you just did? Why don't you think about what you just did? Hmm.

 I will live with that forever, but this is about you.

 I swear to you on my mother's grave, I didn't do a thing! Sorry, sorry.

 So, the Flanderses got a new dog, and it knows my name! Good for you, little girl! Marge, Bart, I've noticed neither of you have said a word all meal.

 Are there feelings going unexpressed here? Because if there are I believe someone at this table isn't telling us the truth.

 Master Bart Simpson! Kids, could you excuse us for a moment? Your mother and I need to have an adult conversation.

 What'd he do? What'd he do? (laughs) Your son stole a bulldozer.

 How do you know? - A mother knows.

 Does a wife know things? - Yes.

 (shrieks) I believe we were talking about Bart.

 I'm afraid I don't know how to handle him anymore.

 Oh, Bart's ten.

 He's too old to be handled.

 We should just think of excuses for when he goes bonkers.

 Oh.

 "Acne medicine.

" When in doubt, blame the acne medicine.

 No, I'm not giving up on Bart, just like I didn't give up on our marriage when you quit your job to start the North American Sumo League.

 The NASL would have made money if someone had washed a few sumo loincloths for me! I said I would do yours, but not the whole dojo.

 Bart, get in here! Look me in the eye and tell me you know nothing about that bulldozer.

 I know nothing about that bulldozer.

 MARGE: This is bad.

 He can't tell his mother what he does.

 Where will that lead? (with Irish accent): Any last words, boyo? I know nothing about that bulldozer.

 Give him the juice! (electricity crackling) (laughs) Which one's yours? The one being electrocuted! I've never seen an eyeball pop so fast.

 I wish I could tell you about that bulldozer, but how can I explain something I know nothing about? I am not cable news.

 Stop it! Stop it! Stop lying right now! But-but you have to believe me.

 You're my mom! All right, I will believe you on this.

 Smart.

 But until then, I'm going to keep my eye on you.

 All the time.

 All the time? How are you gonna change Maggie? Ah, close enough.

 OTTO: All aboard.

 Mom, what are you doing? I told you, to trust you, I have to watch you.

 All the time.

 Mmm.

 You're gonna be riding this bus? I'm going to be watching my son wherever he goes.

 Then you'd better go out the back, 'cause that's where he went.

 D'oh! (barking) Oh, you must be Flanders' new dog.

 I just want to apologize in advance for the things I'm gonna blame on you.

 Homer, meet Baz.

 (barking) - (laughing) Oh, sorry, Flanders.

 I'm sure she has fun with you.

 (laughs) She sure likes you.

 Must be the cheeseburgers in your sweat.

 Cheeseburgers in my sweat.

 Really? Now, apparently, I have cheeseburgers in my sweat.

 I can leave any time, Bart.

 Just tell me what happened with that bulldozer.

 Next question.

 - Fine.

 Which papers on the walls are yours? None of them.

 Is that the boy who copies off you? I copy off him?! What brand of poppycock is this miscreant feeding you, madam? Okay, Mom, I admit it.

 There's a few lies I told you that you're gonna find out.

 Simpson, you said your mother was dead.

 (groans) She's become a zombie! Run! (humming) Mom, churros are good for you.

 They're ethnic.

 Hey, Simpson, you need your mommy to cut your carrots for you? He can cut his own carrots.

 Baby carrots 'cause he's a baby! (laughter) Brilliant! Mom, Dad does plenty of stuff you don't like.

 Why don't you follow him? Following an adult is creepy.

 Following your kid is parenting.

 I'm so lucky my mom's in Gainesboro, Florida I think.

 Is my mom still outside? She's swinging on a swing, and Ralph's pushing her.

 RALPH: Hello! Good-bye! Hello! Good-bye! Hello! Good-bye! Hello! Good-bye! Hello! Good-bye! I am never leaving this tube.

 Sorry, lad.

 You've been in more than five minutes, so I've got to remove you.

 And I'm authorized to use the greatest weapon at me disposal.

 (playing "Highland March") No! Scotland! 1,200 years, and we've only written one song! (resumes playing) (loud gulping) Man.

 (gulps) Staying on this all-pork-chop diet is easier than I thought.

 That diet doesn't work.

 You have to give it a year.

 So, how was school today? Well, actually, I caused quite a ruckus in the nurse's office by pointing out they weren't putting fresh paper on the lay-down table.

 Very good, sweetie.

 Could you lean back? I have to focus on your brother.

 Sure, sure.

 No need to worry about Lisa.

 Lisa's always fine.

 No worries there.

 Nah.

 (scratching sound) (barking) Aw.

 What are you doing here? I bet you escaped, and now Flanders is worried sick.

 I should call him after I scratch your tummy! That's right! Who likes their tummy scratched while Flanders is worried sick? You do! You do! Yes, you do! Oh, he doesn't know where you are.

 (laughing): Yes, he's probably crying right now.

 (growling) Come on, boy.

 We'll go to my room.

 I can play jazz, or give you a bath, or (sighs) Never chooses jazz.

 Hmm? (grunts) - (groans) Middle child.

 No one cares about the middle child.

 Never, ever gonna change.

 Lisa, can I talk to you? Oh, here it is, the quick check-in every two years just like clockwork.

 All right, let me speak to you in a language you'll understand.

 Oh, boy, oh, boy, Lisa never gets it.

 She's great, and everyone knows that.

 Oh, man, trying to stay mad.

 I'm kind of impressed that Dad's making an effort.

 It's not really like him.

 I shouldn't say this.

 I should never say this, but I will.

 She's my favorite child.

 Oh, now he's pulling out the big guns.

 Oh, I don't want to pout anymore.

 If he offers me ice cream, I'm gonna break.

 You want some ice cream? (whoops) - Yes! Ice cream.

 Oh, yeah, it's kid whiskey.

 I knew he was gonna break.

 I'm gonna write a song.

 That makes them happy, and the best part is Is there such a thing as happy blues? There is now.

 (whoops) I get some ice cream, too.

 (Homer laughing, dog barking) Boys, isn't that the ball that she won't play with? She likes it when Uncle Homer throws it.

 He's not your uncle! So that means I can marry Maggie? Quit asking me that! (rustling in brush) Be ye friend or foe? Well, be ye? (sighs) This is the only place I can go my mom doesn't know about.

 Bart, you know you're always welcome to come stay in my tree house.

 You don't have a tree house.

 My dad's gonna build it.

 That's why I didn't get a present from him last birthday and Christmas.

 It's gonna be some tree house.

 Milhouse, you don't even have a tree.

 He's gonna plant it soon.

 He just has to get enough money together to buy a pack of apple seeds.

 Just hand me the Mountain Doo.

 Your mom says that makes you bloated.

 Give me the damn Doo! Finally safe from my mom.

 She wouldn't want to come way out here and ruin her dainty little shoes.

 (loud rustling, booming footsteps) (yowls) When she's got that much hair spray, nothing can stop her.

 How'd you find me? Spool of thread in your pants.

 I'll respool it for you.

 I'm good at doing things so I can pretend there isn't a fight going on.

 Mom, you have gone too far.

 Superman's mom would never go in his Fortress of Solitude! Actually, the Fortress of Solitude has a statue of Superman's mother.

 Stop reading my comics! I can't help it-- you leave them out everywhere.

 When will you leave me alone? When you tell me about that bulldozer.

 I know nothing about that bulldozer! Milhouse, is there something you know about the bulldozer? Well, I know the bulldozer was invented in 1923 by James Cummings and J.

 Earl McLeod.

 Now, please, let me focus on the thread! Got to get out.

 Get to get out.

 HOMER: D'oh! Dad, are you gonna snitch on me? Moe's before bros!  (quietly): Crouching Tiger, Hidden Mom.

 Whoopsy.

 (silence) (engine grinding) Hmm? Oh! (dog growling playfully) "Property of Ned Flanders"? That means you got this from Homer.

 Lord, I truly love this dog, but maybe she'd be happier next door.

 But I don't want to give her up unless you think it's the best.

 As always, I will interpret the lack of any sort of response as a sign of thy will.

 (sad sigh)  Well, the kid passed through again.

 We can all go inside.

  Nice rowing, Bart.

 Good job.

 Stop caring about me! (panting) Sweetie, let me help you up.

 Your nagging is melting my bones.

 (whining) (continues whining) Okay, fine! I'm giving you one more chance, buster.

 Tell me about that bulldozer! What bulldozer? You're in charge of yourself.

 Get home whenever.

 My parenting stops now.

 Oh.

 Okay, now.

 (sighs) At last! A way off Lepers Island! Oh (gasps) Boys, I realize now that Baz would be happier in another home.

 So we're giving her to Ho Ho Ho We're giving her to Santa? No! Someone fatter.

 Oh, I'm sorry, boys, that you had to hear that mild insult.

 Mild insults are like mild salsa-- they still burn! (quietly): Bart, should I shut the door? No need.

 My mom's cool now.

 Check it out-- last night, I stayed up till 10:45.

 Oh, my God! BART: I took a picture so I could show everybody.

 Now let me show you what I've been planning.

 (Ã  la Mayor Quimby): Er, uh, welcome to our celebration of, er, uh, our city's lame-o sign.

 You nailed him! "Fie"? Yeah.

 Look it up.

 "Used to express disgust or outrage"? (gasps) That's the worst F-word there is! Bart, I'm not butting in anymore, so you don't have to hide things under your blanky.

 It isn't a blanky anymore.

 Hasn't been for three months! So, we want you to have our dog.

 You just give her love, and I'll pay for all the shots.

 Shots? What, is she going to India? Bye, Baz.

 (barks) (sniffling) HOMER: Aw, geez, I can't stand to see Flanders sad.

 Or happy.

 Pretty much can't stand to see Flanders.

 But he'll need something to cheer him up when his boys run away.

 You know what, Flanders? I think you should take her back.

 Homer, don't be crazy.

 Look at that tail wag for you.

 Have you seen what it does for me? No, no, no.

 To her, I'm just another dog.

 A dog she's in love with but can never have.

 But she's only got one of you, Flanders-- the guy who will take care of her forever.

 Oh, thank you, Homer.

 This has been the happiest dog day afternoon ever.

 Aw I'm still not sure-- did you do that bulldozer thing before? You were there.

 Maybe when I hit you with the blade, you forgot some stuff.

 I was trying to get your attention, but it was heavier than I thought.

 Well, no one fought more than Cummings and McLeod when they invented the bulldozer.

 Even the name "bulldozer" was a great source of Aah! Bart, I can't do this.

 No offense, but I have a mother who still loves me.

 QUIMBY: We come here today to honor this sign, which was purchased, letter by letter, from other failed towns.

 Huh? Aw, stupid Mom.

 Stuck something in my backpack.

 Typical.

 Oh, man, she makes good chicken.

 You're the best boy a mom could want.

 I've failed as a mother! I'm growing a conscience! I've got to change this prank.

 Much better.

 (creaking) Our iconic sign is aquiver! (nervous chuckle) Everyone remain calm.

 This is a part of the show.

 (quietly): VIP's, follow me.

 Much better.

 I don't seen nothing wrong.

 Better to die a VIP than to live as an ordinary American citizen.

 SKINNER: It says "F-D.

" It's a tribute to the fire department.

 (crowd cheers) The chili-cooking saints of the city! It's true-- we do love our chili.

 The secret is stirring it.

 I'm a huge fan.

 That's why I wear suspenders and start little fires here and there.

 (panting): Mom, Mom I learned there's a line I won't cross, and it's 'cause of you and your chicken.

 That woman does make convincing chicken.

 You're the best boy a mother could want if you tell me about the bulldozer.

 All right.

 It was me.

 (gasps) Why, you little (quiet grunting) (chuckles) Yeah, harder to strangle than it looks, isn't it, Marge? Oh And you're under arrest.

 How'd you figure it out? I heard you say it.

 The only way I solve any crime.

 You don't have to stop hugging.

 (coughing) So you see, Mom, because of the wrinkled lay-down paper in the nurse's office, I got mono.

 You really should've kept your eyes on that ball.

 Oh, all these problems.

 You kids are like whack-a-moles.

 Oh, that reminds me.

 Maggie hurt herself playing whack-a-mole.

 Aw.

 Come here, you.

 Come here.

 I know I've been having my fun elsewhere, and no one could blame you if you didn't take me back, but if you'll have me, I'll take you on the longest walk of your life! No hills.

 Dogs-- so easy to make up with.

 (theme from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly playing) (meows) Shh!   


                





                    			 Oh, for gloyvin' out loud.

 (exclaiming) (school bell ringing) (Barney belches) (whistle blows) (yells) (beeping) (playing harp solo) (playing harp solo) (tires screeching) D'oh! (tires screeching) (grunts) Well, this is a no-brainer.

 (whoops) D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! (groans) Now what? (screams) (sighs) Well, I better get going.

 Should I just put that on your tab? No, I'll pay off my bill.

 Hmm? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Someone's actually paying? Now let me see if I remember how to open this thing.

 Some kind of button or knob.

 (bell dings) So that's what that noise means.

 Just take your stupid money.

 Huh? Hey, this jacket's full of old stuff.

 I knew I wasn't getting my money.

 Hey.

 D'oh! Losers.

 What the? Oh.

 Ooh! Here's a roll of film I never developed.

 Well, too late for that.

 All those photo developing joints are either knocked down or have been turned into deer blinds.

 Eh, listen, Homer.

 Uh, I can develop this for you.

 Yeah, this bar is so poorly lit, it's legally a darkroom.

 Mmm mmm.

 And the best part is, Duff is chemically indistinguishable from developing fluid.

 Way to go, Duff! I'm developing quite a thirst.

 Now, there's an eight-by-ten I can enjoy.

 (squeals) Here you go, Midge.

 I played with the colors and changed the lighting, but I could only make your kids so cute and no cuter.

 This is so exciting.

 It's like a sneak peek into the long-forgotten world of six years ago.

 Yeah, well, beware.

 These pictures show that six years ago, Bart and Lisa were fighting like creationists and common sense.

 (gasp) Hey, photos don't lie, my friend.

 (worried groaning) Would you like a matte finish? Sure.

 (Moe chuckles) There you go.

  And I know if I don't   I'll go out of my mind   Better leave her behind   With the kids, they're all right   The kids are all right   The kids are all right.

  Homer, you shot all these pictures.

 Why didn't you step in? The light was so good, Marge.

 It was like Florence in May.

 I don't get it.

 How come I was always fighting with SeÃ±orita Stupid? (groans) Don't waste beer.

 And how did we reach the uneasy alliance we enjoy today? Well, it's quite a story.

 A story of a special bond between a brother and a sister.

 I'd say our story is a tragedy.

 Like the Planet of the Apes.

 The tragedy being they can never stop making them.

 Hey, come on.

 The first and eighth movies were pretty darn good.

 Now, as for you kids, it all began six years ago.

 The president of back then was the president.

 The popular music of those times was all the rage.

 Wherever we went, you kids fought.

 "Penny the Penguin wanted to go to the North Pole.

 Wally the Walrus wanted to go to the South Pole.

" I guess you could say they were "polar opposites.

" (groans) You see, they're polar opp I get it.

 It's just not funny.

 You know what's funny? This.

 Goodnight Moon? Good night, Bart! (grunting) (groans) Did I hear someone whispering hush? (worried groaning) (whispering): I want you to get out.

 And stay out! (whispering): Thank you.

 So that's why we started going to story time at the Kwik-E-Mart.

 Remember when Apu let Dad have the expired hot dogs? (groans) Just once, and I'm still taking medication for it.

 (groans) So many photos of you kids fighting.

 That's why we never developed that roll.

 What? Back to that story? Why can't you just relax and be nice to your sister? My bed scares me.

 That's ridiculous.

 Now, just close your eyes and nuzzle in under the big clown fangs.

 Attaboy.

 Sweet dreams.

 She took my pencil.

 Lisa, there are plenty of mini golf pencils in the kitchen drawer.

 Tell Bart, because it's my pencil and he stole it! (grunts) Starfish head! I can write your name better than you.

 (humming) (groans) (over speaker): A.

 Ow! E.

 Ow! I.

 Ow! O.

 You jerk! Ow! Why, you little ("Also Sprach Zarathustra" playing) (angry groaning) (choking) (chuckles) Where is he learning this violence? (sighs) Things got so bad between Bart and Lisa, I was losing sleep.

 (gasping) Homer.

 Homer, I just had the worst dream.

 I lost one of the kids at the World's Fair.

 It's okay.

 Which one? Brisbane '88.

 (gasps) That's so horrible, baby.

 I know, I know.

 Now, don't worry.

 They're right here in the bed.

 (sleepy grunting) We have to find some answers.

 (scoffs) Answers.

 That's your answer for everything.

 My findings are that one of your children is smart and good, and the other is dim and evil.

 Professionally, I'm not permitted to say which is which.

 Is it the boy? I told you, I can't say.

 BART: What did that say? We're done here.

 Not so fast.

 We have 40 minutes left.

 All right, we'll do a trust exercise.

 Shut your eyes.

 What are we going to do? It's not so bad, sweetie.

 I took a box of Altoids from her waiting room.

 The most anyone has ever gotten out of therapy.

 (groaning) (grunting) Watch it! Trying to mow.

 The city's making me do this.

 Hey, neighboreeno.

 (groans) Maude and I know how hard it is to be dealt a pair of little jokers.

 Daddy, may we please go tuck ourselves in for naps now? Now, you know you can't tuck yourselves in till you're 18.

 Go get Mommy.

 (humming happily) I'm sorry you had to witness that.

 Me, too.

 Anyway, Maude and I thought you'd like to hang out with adults and have some mature conversatiaroonies, so we'd like to take you to brunch.

 Brunch? I wish.

 Can't get a sitter 'cause our kids are nuts, and no kennel will take them.

 Now, sir, don't you waffle on that brunch.

 Grandma Flanders can watch the kids.

 Hello, Joe.

 Doesn't know who I am has trouble moving I'd say we have ourselves babysitter.

 I just turned a hundred.

 Eight bucks an hour.

 I can't hear you.

 I said seven bucks! (over speaker): "Woe to you, scribes, Pharisees, hypocrites.

 For you tithe mint and dill and cumin.

" Todd, I like how gentle you are with that toy.

 Enough nonsense.

 It's time for prayers.

 I don't know any prayers.

 Is "hell's bells" a prayer? 'Cause Daddy says it all the time.

 (screaming) (Homer humming) Woop and woop and ziperoo.

 (moaning) I never said this before, but the food can wait.

 (gasps) What do you mean? Let's role- play.

 Okay, but fast.

 Um, um, got it.

 Uh, me: seagull.

 You: boardwalk trash can.

 Ooh! (cawing) Well, isn't this a great chance to drink more water? My bladder's going to burst.

 I know you've haa few too many waters, but that is no reason for the sailor talk.

 She's awfully quiet.

 Her body usually whistles.

 Well, this always wakes my grandpa up.

 (both scream) (continue screaming) HOMER:  Another bride   Another June  MARGE:  Another sunny honeymoon   Another season   Another reason  MARGE:  For what we're doing.

  (Homer caws) They're never that happy when we're around.

 (lullaby chimes) BOTH: Ice cream truck! Mmm, that was wonderful.

 My favorite kind of weekend morning.

 A sexy snuggle while our rotten kids are someone else's problem.

 (laughs) (laughs harder) (gasping laughs) Bart, those are strangers.

 You're right, let's go where it's safe.

 (horn honks) MAN: Watch it! (horn honking) Faster, faster.

 Your brother is stupid.

 Bye-bye.

  The wheel I'm inside goes round and round   Round and round, round and round   The boat I'm on board goes up and down   Up and down, up and down  Thank you for a wonderful brunch.

 I don't know what I liked more-- the personalized omelets or the light jazz combo.

 I liked when the trumpet player's cheeks got really big.

 That's good music.

 (Ned gasps) (screams) Grandma Flanders has passed.

 Where are our kids? Gone.

 Looks like once Grandma turned to dust, they took a powder.

 Sorry if that seems a little flip.

 (hyperventilating): Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

 Don't worry, sweetie.

 We'll call the local police, and they'll find our kids.

 We never used them till now, but I'm sure they're highly competent.

 Gunderson, before we hire you, one final test.

 Can you get these handcuffs off of me? Uh, might seem like a one-time situation, but it's not.

 (telephone rings) Hey, you know, I used to represent Silver Star Police Supplies.

 Then they gave my territory to the owner's nephew.

 And they wonder why they lost Jackson City.

 I was Jackson City! Yeah, focus on the cuffs, please.

 Well, well.

 Look who's burning plastic.

 It's mine.

 Give it back.

 Looks like someone hasn't learned-- you don't argue with bullies.

 Thank goodness I have a teaching fist.

 (laughing) (Lisa crying) What's her problem? Please, don't hurt my brother.

 Aw, come on.

 Don't cry.

 This is why I'm so nervous about becoming a dad.

 (snorts, cries) I'm crying out my nose.

 (snorts, cries) Fine, you babies can go.

 Let's go over to Mommy &amp; Me and cut holes in the parachute so it doesn't billow properly.

 (laughs) Baby! All right, let's move.

 Why aren't you crying? I was pretending, and it worked.

 Hmm.

 You know, kid, with your smarts and my Barts, we make a good team.

 What are "Barts"? You're the smart one, you figure it out.

 (nervous groaning) I sure hope this book is right.

 (door opens) HOMER: Marge, I'm back.

 Sorry, nothing.

 But if we have a third kid, we should call her Maggie.

 Why Maggie? It's a good name if we lose her.

 Maggie? Maggie? Going back out.

 Maggie? All right, I'm turning to a desperate mother's last resort.

 (sighs) I hope it works.

 Psychic hotline.

 Selma? You're a psychic now? I'm filling in for a friend.

 She got hit by a car.

 Never saw it coming.

 (groans) I'll never see my kids again.

 I'm sensing it's all your husband's fault.

 That'll be $20.

 (groans) I know this place.

 It's where Grampa and his friends the monsters live.

 (creepy moaning) (moans) I want to pinch 'em.

 Teach me how to use my phone.

 Stay away from my grandchildren, you love-sucking ghouls.

 (moaning like zombies) (muttering) Wait a minute, wait a minute.

 I made it out of clay.

 (moans) Where did you go? Now, you have some candy, while I tell the nurses station to go get your folks.

 (snoring) I guess you should be in charge, Lisa.

 You'll always be half my age, but you'll always be smarter than me.

 Don't worry, Bart, you'll always think you're in charge, even though I secretly will be.

 Thank you.

 Okay.

 Listen up, you childless losers.

 I need you to help me find my kids.

 Any of these them? Hmm? Uh no.

 Sorry, kids.

 I'll place you with your parents, but for now, go back to making those little drink umbrellas.

 CARL: Homer, we'll definitely help you, but, uh, you're gonna have to wait.

 We just ordered a pie for the bar.

 What'd you do that for? Yeah, it took us 45 minutes to choose a topping.

 We decided on cheese.

 Twice! A new record.

 We're lost.

 Can you help us? I'll tell my dad about you right now.

 Dad! Dad! Dad! Cartoons.

 Milhouse, keep it down.

 I got to finish these tax returns.

 Ooh, cartoons.

 (suspenseful music, cat yowls) (explosion booms) Whoa! Big dog! Big dog! Big dog! Big dog! (barking) (barking continues) I'm scared, Bart.

 Once, I read a book called Jack and Jill.

 They went down a hill.

 And broke their crowns! Good thing we don't have crowns.

 "Crown" means head! Ay, caramba! (screaming) Ta-da! I saved you! Ugh! But you pushed me! Duh.

 I couldn't save you until I pushed you.

 Girls make no sense! Anyway, we're even-Steven.

 I just don't want to fight anymore.

 Okay.

 But it was always your fault.

 Fine.

 'Cause you're a jerk.

 (grunts) Can't you see I'm giving in? (singsongy): I beat a two-year-old, I beat a two-year-old.

   (gasping)   I left my kids with the weirdo next door, and now they're gone! Tell me everything.

 (gasps) Homer, no! (shrieks) (pants) I'd give anything to have them back.

 I don't care about the fighting.

 Hey, chatterbox, there's a couple of kids right there at the top of the tire fire.

 (both gasp) How did you get up there?! You know how kids like to climb things.

 What are we gonna do?! They say you're supposed to get great strength when your kids are threatened.

 I'm kind of feeling it.

 We just bought them new shoes.

 (fierce roaring) You did it, Homie! (both yelling) (both grunt) Ah Ah (screams) (gasps) (bed creaking) (lullaby chiming) Ice cream truck! Bart! Haven't you learned anything? I'm still learning our phone number.

 And I've almost got it.

 But in an emergency, I'll just dial 9-1-8.

 But the wonderful thing is, you kids get along.

 And we were able to have a third beautiful child.

 Wait.

 But how did you have an extra room for Maggie? Well, that's where I used to grow my weed.

 But that's a story for another day.

 Never mind, never mind.

 Well, I didn't think she'd make it, but I was wrong.

 I guess your grandmother just wants to stick around to see those boys grow up.

 (cheering)  Amazing grace   How sweet the sound  Loud singing could kill her.

 HOMER: And it did.

 Stop telling us this story! You've had three natural endings already! Isn't that sweet? Six years ago, they were fighting.

 Now they're playing pool in a bar.

 Father of the year, pal.

 Father of the year.

 Shh!   


                





                    			 (crow caws) D'oh! (tires screeching) (grunting) (squeaking) (belches) (electrical crackling) Lewis, my man.

 Present table's over there.

 (barking) Make sure you hit the Squishee station.

 They mixed up a custom flavor just for me! (kids chattering playfully, laughing) These kids' birthday parties have gotten out of control.

 How can a normal family compete? They rented chairs.

 The kind with puffy seats! And check out this gift bag.

 Full-size candy bars, hummingbird in a plastic bag, a CD of The Gay Men's Chorus of Springfield singing "Happy Birthday, Milhouse.

" Dad, I want self-driving mini-cars at my next birthday! To the petting zoo! That would cost a fortune! Who do you think I am, a professional bowler? It's worth it to see my son as spoiled and ungrateful as the richest brat in town.

 Dad, you were supposed to cut this cheese in the shape of PokÃ©mon characters.

 You said you wanted Disney's Muppets! That was the meeting before the last meeting! (grunts) (sighs) This birthday party arms race is unsustainable.

 Unless the sanest man in town declared war on these parties in a last best attempt to bring things back to normal.

 I will secretly destroy these children's birthdays, or die trying.

 Two of several animals! Looks like it's time to build me an ark.

 Rice cakes?! I pronounce this party dead.

 Nurse, note the time.

 (chuckles) (tires squeak) (humming, singing) Time to make 50 bucks.

  Yah-dah, dah-dat  Ooh! (children shrieking, gasping) Look at that.

 Let's see what else is in the noose.

 (laughing like Krusty) I was the last kid on Earth who liked clowns.

 (humming) Homer Simpson, do you know anything about these epic birthday fails? (high-pitched voice); Just what I read in the papers.

 You did suck the helium out of all these balloons! (high-pitched voice): All right, Marge, maybe I did cut the strings on a few party hats, but when I was a kid, a birthday party was nothing more than a supermarket cake and sticking pins in a donkey's butt.

 (clears throat) (normal voice): And we looked forward to it for one whole year.

 And the gift bag was You didn't need a frickin' gift bag, because you just went to a frickin' party! You have a point.

 But when the bounce house renters and the pony ride operators find out what you've done Mm.

 (scoffs) I'm not afraid of Big Birthday.

 (shrieks) Big Birthday! You have meddled with the primal forces of nurture, Mr.

 Simpson, and I won't have it! Do you think you just stopped a few lavish parties? Oh, no, sir.

 There is simply one endless birthday celebration where everyone gets a gift bag and no parent gets off easy.

 Do you think this country makes cars anymore? Do you think we smelt steel? No.

 The only thing we do is throw elaborate children's cotillions with enormous inedible cakes out from whence Yale graduates pop! ALL (groaning): Eh.

 Mr.

 Simpson, the very fabric of our existence is birthdays! The quarks and bosons of your soul? Birthdays! You have tried to unwind the world, and you will atone! Sorry.

 You will be sorry.

 We are officially blacklisting you, my friend.

 Your children will never have a balloon animal maker or customized cake again! (both gasping) No! No! (crying): No-oh-oh-oh! I don't want to live.

 Not their birthdays! Take Easter! Easter's nothing.

 Geez, kids, I guess you've had your last birthday.

 You're gonna stay your current ages for the rest of your lives.

 Please.

 I'll do anything.

 All right.

 The next birthday that comes up in this town is, uh, Rod Flanders, and you have to throw him a party.

 (groans): Oh.

 Um, how bad do you kids want birthdays? Dad! How bad do you want to sleep in Saturdays? (banging loudly) Hey, hey, hey, I was just kidding around.

 You know that.

 I was just You have a deal.

 Let me make this clear.

 This event has to be magical.

 You mean, hire a magician? No, no, no.

 Magical.

 Magical events change people's lives forever.

 (plane sputtering) Welcome to Rod Flanders' birthday party.

 I'm your host Homer Simpson, and I can't take it anymore! Stupid golden age of flight! Mmm.

 I love you, mean neighbor! MAN (over P.

A.

): Attention partygoers! Prepare for the arrival of our guest of honor Lulu! This majestic B-17 has been lovingly restored by the same World War Two veterans who see her every night in their horrible flashbacks.

 Thanks for coming out and Abe Simpson?! That's Mach Ridley, my old Air Force buddy! You said you were in the Army.

 You said you were in the Navy.

 That's the kind of mix-up that used to happen when I was in the Marines.

 So, what brings you boys to Springfield? Uh, we just want to make sure kids have a chance to meet one of the lovely ladies that brought freedom to the world.

 Why are planes and boats always women? Because they require a lot of upkeep and a firm hand at the controls.

 I knew there'd be a sexist joke behind it.

 I knew it! Abe, can you join us for a drink? I'm sorry, guys.

 My dad can't handle that much excitement.

 Please, son.

 I want to gab about the days when nurses kissed ya instead of beating ya.

 Now, Dad, memory lane's not what it used to be.

 If you hang out with your old buddies, it'll remind you of when you were a proud stallion instead of a broken-down nag.

 (neighs sadly) (sputters) That's the lack of spirit.

 (whimpering) Look at how he treats his own father.

 Like we used to treat P.

O.

W.

s when the Red Cross wasn't looking.

 (laughter) Boys, I think we have one last mission.

 (mechanical whirring) Make a wish, Roddy.

 I'll never grow up and marry Daddy! (laughter) (Dutch accent): Very amusing.

 Whoa! I've seen all I need to see.

 But just in case, the face.

 MILHOUSE: Oh! May I chuckle in Dutch? (chuckles) Bart, meet my cousin from the Netherlands, Annika.

 Isn't she gorgeous? (laughs) Whoa! You smoke? It's an e-cigarette.

 Care to vape? Don't you want to be one of the cool kinderen? (inhaling) (coughing) (coughing, gasping) (snorts) Refreshing.

 (knocking) Hey, look at you guys, still not dead.

 Good for you.

 Mister, we're gonna pound your thick skull till you treat your father with the kindness every human being deserves.

 (scoffs) Do your worst, you old goats.

 This won't be a tropical vacation like Iwo Jima.

 It's you and me, Blubber McGee.

 Ha! (muttering) (muttering) Oh.

 (grunting) (laughs) (panting) (grunts) You done girly punching? Yes.

 (laughs) Once again, I win at Sjoelbak.

 Everybody's got one gift.

 Mine is portable indoor Dutch shuffleboard.

 (humming) Bart, I'm out of cartridges.

 Be my little almond cookie and run down to the Kwik-E-Mart.

 Hup, hup.

 You can kiss me.

 (squeaking) Oh, that felt so good.

 Now you know what nuzzling me would be like.

 Now not so good.

 (whistling) Five packs of e-cigs, Apu.

 E-cigs? Although legal for children in this state, you are asking for a nicotine delivery device that could quite possibly leave you breathing through a hole in your neck.

 Eat your spinach, Bart.

 ELECTRONIC VOICE: Ha, ha, ha, ha! Ay carumba! Cool! I was just doing this for a girl, but give me two more packs for myself.

 Oh, you have the right, but remember, this is not kid stuff.

 Now, would you like bubblegum flavor, strawberry shortcake or watermelon dream? Homer, you're late! In the Air Force, when we showed up late, people died.

 When we showed up on time, other people died.

 The right people.

 Homer J.

 Simpson, if I wasn't wearing my smiling teeth, I'd look very angry.

 Hangar those choppers, airman.

 Now, the best way to get to know each other is to share a rugged outdoor activity.

 Suggestions? BOTH: Movie.

 Well, we could walk to the theater.

 BOTH: Drive.

 Well, at least we can walk to a seat at the top.

 Handicap seat.

 Companion chair.

 (groans) HOMER: Ooh, previews!   TRAILER ANNOUNCER: In a dystopian future Finally! A movie about a dystopian future, unlike The Hunger Games, Edge of Tomorrow, Oblivion, Elysium, Snow Piercer, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, X-Men: Days of Future Past, Enders Game The Road, World War Z, Children of Men, After Earth, I Am Legend, Mad Max: Fury Road, The Maze Runner, District Nine, The Purge, Looper, Cloud Atlas, Divergent, Insurgent, The Island, Mr.

 Burns: A Post-Electric Play, and Chappie.

 (both shudder) Sir, the movie's been over for 20 minutes.

 You'll have to clear out of the theater and come back for the next show.

 D'oh! So, you are the best America could send to stop Sheik Abu Nadal Abdul Nabal Nabu Dubal Nabadul Kashik? I'd like to request a hip replacement: yours.

 I was a fool to fight America.

 (screams) Homer, take me to the bathroom.

 What? Are you crazy? If you love your father, you'll make sure he doesn't get disoriented trying to work the knob-less faucet.

 I'm too cold to trigger the infrared.

 (groans) (explosions, gunshots over speakers) (whistling tune) You were in there for 25 minutes! I thought the mirror was another movie.

 You made me miss the denouement! Homer, I think it's time I showed you something.

 I get it.

 You brought me here to show me how much Grampa went through for people like me.

 No, we brought you here 'cause we're gonna set you straight once and for all.

 I think I just went W.

W.

 Two.

 All right, all right.

 I love my father.

 And if that makes me less of a man, so be it.

 (awkward noises) (affectionate noises) Dad, I apologize.

 I only say this at gunpoint, but it's true: I love you.

 Oh.

 But it's been a long night I did not say "at ease.

" (whimpers) Fear-- that's how we, the greatest generation, raised you, the worst generation.

 My turn! (laughing) God, I love spijkerpoepen.

 Annika, you've introduced me to a whole new world of butt games.

 And you've introduced me to a world of un-milled wind, a game called "baseball" that is neither fun nor fittening, and private-use bicycles.

 Still, you are small and cute like Lichtenstein.

 Now vape up.

 MARGE (gasping): Bart Simpson! (coughing) It's still legal in this state! The bill's stuck in committee.

 God, you just can't protect your kids enough.

 (worried groan) Mmm.

 Sharing a beer.

 Just like we did after your first merit badge.

 Ah, yes, basketry.

 Aw Aw I still have what I made.

 D'oh! Bart's smoking! (gasps) E-cigarettes! Oh, those are totally legal.

 Tell me, does he like bubblegum or strawberry? He doesn't even want to.

 He's doing it to impress a girl.

 They're sending Annika back to Holland! She was just about to teach me to Dutch kiss.

 Stuck on a girl, eh? I know a story that'll fix you right up.

 It was the 1950s suitcases were hard, mid-century architecture had indoor-outdoor flow and the world was our garbage basket.

 Nature will take it.

 (humming) GRAMPA: Mach was a test pilot and I had a crucial job, too: keeping desert turtles off the runway.

 Shoo! Shoo, now! Just pick them up! Uh they feel weird.

 GRAMPA: At night, we cooled off at the local watering hole, where they gave you a free steak dinner if'n you set a new speed record and lived.

 If you died, your widow got surf and turf.

 Meanwhile, I was trying to make time with the only cocktail waitress on a base full of heroes.

 We called her "Sunny" 'cause she was bright and yellow.

 And if you got too close, you got burned? Who's telling this story, you or me?! I hope it's you.

 Okay, well, I would imagine as you were flirting with Sunny, Mach came up.

 Uh-huh, go on.

 And asked her to dance? Ooh, I did not see that coming!   GRAMPA: Mach was scheduled to test-fly a new fighter plane.

 And then I heard something I shouldn't have.

 Colonel, with all due respect, that new jet is a deathtrap.

 It's the 1950s.

 Everything's a deathtrap.

 Now have three martinis, a pack of smokes, and get in that plane.

 GRAMPA: I'm not quite sure why I did what I did next.

 Did I want Sunny to see me in a different light? Or had they tested a little too much LSD on me the night before without me knowing it? Abraham Simpson, you damn fool! When did you learn how to fly? When you're in the Air Force for ten years, you learn a few things.

 Ah! What the hell just happened? (laughing) GRAMPA: It was as if I could see the face of God.

 (engine sputtering) Oh, boy.

 At 50,000 feet, amazing things happen.

 The frigid air forms a beautiful rainbow of ice crystals in your lungs.

 D'oh! Luckily, my frozen hand on the stick was exactly what that plane needed.

 That day, I broke the sound barrier and then some.

 Oh! My highball glasses.

 GRAMPA: I headed back to tell the base there wasn't one damn thing wrong with that plane.

 This is gonna take some fancy flyin'.

 (grunting) I hitched a ride back to the base with a young feller who was hoping to be a writer.

 Thanks for the ride, Jack Kerouac.

 Could you please mail this polished final draft of my novel to my publisher? And here's my rambling, repetitive first draft.

 Promise me you'll destroy it, so no one will ever read this total gibberish.

 GRAMPA: (laughs) Boy, was he mad when he read that book.

 Started drinking like a fish.

 I was about to reel one in.

 So, you want to marry a glamorous flyboy? Or the dummy who tried to save him? I'm a sucker for reckless nitwits.

 Aw, Mona.

 Shut up and kiss me.

 Seriously, I'm already tired of your voice.

 Mona? Sunny is Mona Simpson? Homer's mother? Gee, she wasn't too sunny when I knew her.

 Although she really cheered up after she left you forever.

 That's the point! If you make a grand gesture, you can get any girl you want, even if she's completely wrong for you.

 But it won't last if you're pretending to be someone you're not.

 I see.

 I've got to make a grand gesture.

 And her flight boards in 38 minutes.

 And KLM is never late! (frustrated grunt) He didn't get a single word.

 You got the point, didn't you, son? Um, you used to work with turtles? Yeah, that's pretty much it.

 I used to work with turtles.

   (buzzes) Annika! Wait! Before you leave-- I couldn't live with myself if I didn't at least try to tell you how I feel.

 A grand gesture.

 How American.

 I don't actually like you.

 You're only pleasant when you want something.

 You've been in this country three weeks and you hated everything.

 That's not true.

 I liked that there were new things here to complain about.

 Well, I'm really relieved you're leaving.

 And take these poison pen lights with you! (shrieking, clamoring) Oh, thank God! I'm so tired of breathing clean air! (speaks Dutch) Rejected by a friend of Milhouse.

 I will change into the striped leggings of shame.

 (speaking Dutch) If it's the blue hair and the schnozz you're digging, I've got plenty more cousins.

 Thanks, Milhouse.

 I think I'm gonna steer clear of Van Houtens for a while.

 More for me.

 Marrying a cousin worked out great for my parents.

 Storm's a-comin'.

 Homer, it's time for us to go.

 We've got an air show in Reno, where the silver-haired foxes are as common as Frisbees on the Jersey shore.

 Come on, Dad.

 In honor of that record you broke, I'm gonna cook you the thickest steak of your life.

 Thank you, son.

 But the days when I can eat a steak are long gone.

 I wouldn't be so sure.

 (laughs) No.

 Still too tough.

 Aw, that's the best steak I ever breathed.

 I'm full.

 (Annika speaking Dutch) Shh!   


                





                    			 HOMER: D'oh! WILLIE: Seymour.

 I'm here to tell ya I'm returning to Scotland and you'll never see me again.

 But I have hand-picked my replacement.

 Mr.

 Johnny Mathis.

  Chances are   I will give this hedge a trim   And I will kill the gophers, too  Mmm.

 So beautiful.

 (Mrs.

 Skinner imitating alarm) You're late for school.

 (English accent): And Friday's lunch will be fish sticks, peas I'll finish those morning announcements.

 (clears throat) And lime Jell-O.

 Pathetic.

 Also, Friday night is the school dance.

 And that's a treat for the, uh, popular children, and a chance for the rest of you to look within yourselves and ask what's wrong.

 Seymour.

 Let me know if you make a BM today.

 Oh, my special little guy's first school dance.

 (groans) Why do I have to go to some stupid dance? It makes just standing around with your friends feel like you're a loser.

 Bart, some of your biggest heroes are dancers.

 Krusty was on Dancing with the Stars until a panel of experts determined he wasn't a star.

 (groans) Dad, help me.

 (chuckles) Son, for the rest of your life, you're going to go to all sorts of horrible events just to spend time with girls.

 Dances, stores, your wedding.

 You don't like those things? Oh, no.

 No, no, honey.

 I love everything you force me do.

 And sometimes if you do all that, you get a very special night.

 (groans) And what does that get you? Hopefully, not a you.

  Not gonna make another Bart tonight   If I do it right, no more Barts tonight   No more Barts   Tonight   No Barts!  Hmm? (Flanders humming) Hmm.

 And done.

 Proud of you boys.

 Thanks for painting my fence, Stupid Flanders.

 Homer Simpson, reorder that border.

 We've been painting since sunup.

 Half the fence is mine.

 Fine.

 Let the good Lord decide.

 D'oh! Woo-hoo! D'oh! Woo-hoo! D'oh! Woo-hoo! Now I say good day.

 (chuckles) Good day, Homer.

 I said good day.

 (Homer groans) Well, if it isn't the Frown Princes of Gloomania.

 What's wrong, boys? Uncle Homer's not nice to you.

 Your name's not Stupid.

 It's Ned.

 Whoa, there, Roddy.

 Someone's getting a little too familiar.

 Sorry, Mr.

 Daddy.

 (chuckles) Time to hop aboard the School Train.

 School Train? (funky tune playing) (Otto laughing) I'm going to die, children.

 And so will you someday.

 (screaming) (sighs)   (yells) Thanks a lot, Bart.

 That orange drink machine was my mom's fiancÃ©'s only source of income.

 (grunts) (groans) What a relief.

 This dance has turned into a fight.

 Would you dance with me? (gasps) Where'd you come from? Fifth grade.

 BART: Be careful, Bart.

 If you take her hand now DEMONIC VOICE: Your puberty has started! Who the hell are you? I am the puberty demon.

 (cackles) (high-pitched squeak, clears throat) For a thousand lifetimes of man, I have been going through changes I don't understand.

 You can join me if you just take her hand.

 I'd certainly like to help a demon, but I Do it.

 Enter the world of body spray, wiry hairs and wondering what boobs feel like.

 Do you know? Sure, sure.

 Of course I do.

  She's up all night to the sun  Eh, why not?  I'm up all night to get some   She's up all night for good fun   I'm up all night to get lucky   We're up all night to the sun   We're up all night to get some   We're up all night for good fun   We're up all night to get lucky   We're up all night to get lucky  (Willie grunts)  We're up all night to get lucky   We're up all night to get lucky   We're up all night to get lucky   We're up all night to get lucky   We're up all night to get lucky   We're up all night to get lucky   We're up all night to get lucky.

  (cheering, whooping) Huh? (grunting) I'll have him good as new.

 I just have to get me hammers.

 SKINNER: And tonight's best dancer: Bart Simpson.

 This is for you.

 I'll meet you outside.

 (students oohing) Hey, look.

 It's someone who does stuff.

 The bullies' natural enemy.

 Nice dancing, Bart.

 Hey, knock it off! You're a real leotard.

 (bullies laughing) That works on two levels.

 Yeah.

 Just like the old Springfield Galleria.

 (grunting) Do what you want to me.

 Just don't touch the trophy.

 (laughs) Yeah, right.

 (groans) Hi.

 This is for you.

 Let me give you a life lesson.

 This isn't your fault.

 But it's the end of us forever.

 (cackles) (squeaks, coughs) Oh, uh, hey hey, Cassidy.

 Ugh.

 Sweetie, what happened? Bullies broke my trophy.

 Oh, don't worry.

 When you grow up, you're gonna have a hell of a career.

 Oh, wait, you're not the girl.

 You're gonna have a hell of a career.

 Thank you.

 (giggles) Bullying is wrong, and I'm going to work to change it.

 If I can get them to open up another register at Kroger's, I can do something about this.

 Wha Marge, we don't have Kroger's money.

 (gavel slams) Completing our long-overdue apologies to the witches and their families.

 Our final new business is a proposal from Marge Simpson.

 Ladies and gentlemen, I'm about to show you the world's filthiest word.

 Oh, boy, I can't wait to see this word.

 (all groan) You know, I thought you were gonna say (long bleep) Now, Midge, uh, thanks for coming and alls, but, uh, since frontier days, we've needed bullies to steal land from Indians and, uh, uh, punch locusts.

 But not anymore.

 Let's push bullying to the ground and make it cry and point and laugh at it.

 Yeah, yeah! Absolutely! Let's pass this legislation without any discussion whatsoever.

 So moved.

 All in favor? Who didn't vote for it? I didn't.

 You better freaking vote for it, or we'll bust your face, you little troll.

 (moans weakly) The anti-bullying law has passed without objection.

 Ow.

 Hey, Simpson.

 Come over and get your Christmas socking.

 (siren whoops) By the unregulated power vested in us by the hastily passed bully law, you're under arrest.

 Take 'em away, boys.

 Yeah, grab that hat.

 Boys, I predict you're gonna have clear sledding from here on out.

 Uh, except on those sleds.

 Uh, I'm gonna need 'em as evidence.

 Uh, is that a candy cane, Milhouse? 'Cause, uh, yeah.

 That-that's also evidence.

 Mmm, mmm.

 Uh, yes, Kent, the law gives us broad authority here.

 We're not just going after your garden-variety nurple purpler.

 No, no.

 We're also arresting adult bullies.

 The long-trouser crowd.

 And let me tell you, arresting people who don't think they're criminals-- it's, uh it's a hell of a lot easier.

 Mmm.

 All you worthless writers ever do is stare into your phones.

 Why don't you text me some freaking jokes? A TV star criticizing his writers.

 What has this world come to? Another bully for your collection, boys.

 (grunts) I need some prison jokes.

 Quick.

 How about "Orange is the New Blecch"? Beautiful.

 Uh, yeah.

 A car just cut me off.

 License JDB 653.

 He's a bully.

 (ice rattles) Oh, and the guy that filled my soda gave me mostly ice.

 Bully.

 Mostly ice.

 Dear God.

 I'll never grow a tough enough skin for this job.

 Excuse me, this is madness.

 The ice costs me more than the soda.

 Do you realize this? Ay, ay, ay.

 What hath Mom wrought? The police are arresting basically anyone they want to.

 Lisa, you got to learn to trust your government.

 (whispers): That's what I do.

 (electrical buzzing) (screams, groans) Daddy, can we make cocoa? Boys, I'm afraid Mr.

 Simpson borrowed our mix and our mugs.

 Why don't you ask for things back? Are you being bullied? Now, boys, I'm just turning the other cheek, like Jesus.

 Do you think he was bullied? (bullies laughing) Come on, guys.

 Give it back.

 Oh forgive them, Father.

 I raised a wuss.

 Dear Lord: Please demonstrate unto us Uncle Homer's not a jerk.

 (Homer grunting) See you in hell, old bed.

 (whistling a tune) Oh, come on, Chief.

 Why am I in here? You're a workplace bully.

 Chief, I put my name on my lunch because you are always eating it.

 Bully! Bully! Bully! (phone ringing) Springfield PD.

 Chief speaking.

 Hello? We'd like to report a bully.

 Uh-huh.

 Uh-huh.

 Uh-huh! Wow.

 This bully's going down! Yeah.

 (siren wailing, knocking at door) Ooh, I wonder who this could be! (screams) Homer Simpson, I'm here to charge you with multiple counts of bullying your neighbor, Ned Flanders.

 What the?! Oh, I never dreamed that a law I had abused could be applied to me! All right, time for the perp walk.

 Walk? But I just watered up the Slip'N Slide.

 (groaning) I have no comment at this time! I sentence you to in our new Biff Stiffler Bully Reeducation Center.

 Is it a school? More like a prison.

 Phew! Thank God.

 MAN: Welcome, friends.

 Welcome.

 Welcome.

 No need for names.

 Well, there are need for names, or there'd be billions of people walking around without knowing each other, but I meant here.

 I know what you're going through because I'm a recovering bully myself.

 I was bullied for years and years.

 I tried to solve it in a way that I don't suggest.

 I shot a man.

 But that didn't fix it.

 It fixed it for him.

 He died.

 But I then went to a lot of training.

 I went into the Army, and I was punished, and they told me I got over it.

 I don't feel it, but I'm told I got over it, and I have something on the wall that says I do.

 Ow! Time for step one on the path to empathy, you maggots.

 Can I do yard work like the kids? Your work is internal.

 You mean like vacuuming? Did you really think I meant vacuuming? When I said "internal," your brain went to something inside your house like vacuuming? Is that what you thought? Do you know that's why that Dyson is a billionaire? Something is wrong with you when you think vacuuming.

 I'm talking about inside your head.

 In your head! Oh, it's so boring in there.

 Oh, is it? And I thought it might be like the Louvre.

 Now, no more talking! I know how this works.

 You find the toughest one, you crack that person, and the rest of you fall in line.

 You'll never crack me.

 (chuckles) Ah, you're probably right.

 Just like you never heard your mother say, "I love you.

" (sobbing) There's not enough tissue in the world for what I'm feeling! (sobbing) There, there.

 The first six tissues are free.

 The rest you pay for.

 Use the first two again.

 They don't seem very wet.

 Every bully is woven from the colorful thread known as humiliation.

 Gary, who humiliated you? Well (clears throat) my father was a psychologist.

 He was a big believer in the methods of B.

F.

 Skinner! I had to go through a hamster maze to get to my breakfast.

 Which way is love, Daddy? (voice breaking): Which way is love? (crying) He made me go through a maze.

 Ah.

 Breakthrough.

 Just sit down, Gary.

 Have the free potato chips.

 You, we'll just heavily medicate.

 I'm sorry, there's no other hope.

 Give me your money.

 Oh, beautiful.

 You're just proving my point.

 What about you, Homer? Why do you hate this Flanders? Well, he thinks he's so perfect, with his organized garage and his barbecue grill that never has crud on it.

 That's very good.

 Keep exploring.

 I'm already hating him a little bit.

 Kids who love him and rub his back.

 And he's got enough extra hair for a mustache! All I got are Archie and Wicket here.

 I'm so bald.

 Deeper.

 You've got to go deeper! (in a deep voice): I'm so bald.

 Deeper! And if you think I mean on the ground, I'm going to punch you! Why do you hate Flanders? Oh, everybody hates Flanders.

 No, just you.

 That's right.

 Great guy.

 He ain't no chooch.

 Homer, you've got to find the answer to this.

 It's been bothering you your whole life.

 Also, it's five to 11:00.

 I have ten more people before noon! Oh, can you just tell me the answer? If I told you the answer, then you would not have discovered it for yourself.

 Did you see that, uh, Indiana Jones movie? Did anybody tell him where that thing was? Does this guy know? Well Only you know! All right.

 I hate Ned Flanders because (gasps) because he's better than me in every way! I think we have a breakthrough.

 I was gonna say that, too.

 I used to be a jerk.

 I never cared whose feelings I hurt as long as it got a laugh.

 I took a thumb when a pinky would do.

 But we have learned our lesson, so I hereby promise I promise.

 I promise.

 Te prometo.

 We all promise.

 ALL: To be a better human being.

 Better human being.

 Ugh! Once again, people.

 ALL To be a better human being.

 Better being.

 Does he have to be in this? Well, surprisingly, that was our best take.

 Uh, question: What will this video be used for? Oh, in schools, by police groups.

 CNN.

 They're doing a lot of things now that have nothing to do with news.

 This is great.

 Nothing America likes better than someone who screws up, goes away for a little while, then comes back and tells everyone how to live their lives.

 Oh, I forgot to include remorse.

 Oh, it's okay.

 When it kicks in, it'll be a thousand times worse.

 What happened to me? My mother told me she loved me.

 Maybe I couldn't hear her because my hand was over her mouth.

 Let yourself out, please.

 ANNOUNCER: And here to throw out the first pitch, reformed bully Homer Simpson.

 And the pitch hits the umpire, but it's not an umpire at all.

 It's a returning serviceman from Iraq.

 And the crowd goes wild.

 (applause and cheering) You're a hero.

 No, you're-you're the hero.

 I No, no, you're wrong.

 You're the hero.

 I No, I just I'm not.

 I-I just have a little PTSD.

 No, if you see a hero, you're looking into a mirror, man, because you're the hero.

 Why is Mr.

 Simpson a hero? Well, I suppose it's because he used to be bad and now he's good.

 Yay? Yay? MALE ANNOUNCER: Jenny, the Costington's float contains 10,001 flowers, and work started the day after last year's parade finished.

 FEMALE ANNOUNCER: You say that every year, and it's just not true.

 (male announcer chuckles) MALE ANNOUNCER: Well, there you go again.

 Daddy, maybe someday you'll be a hero like Mr.

 Simpson.

 He's a hero, all right.

 A hero sandwich full of baloney.

 Huh.

 I almost said that in front of the boys! Time I gave that Homer a real tongue bath! Ooh.

 Glad I didn't say that, either.

 Uh-huh! Uh, wait.

 What do you want me to do with this? NED: How about writing, "I'm sorry, Ned"? (mutters) What are you doing here? Homer, sorry is not just the most exciting board game ever devised.

 It's a word I need to hear from you.

 (sighs) Fine.

 Sorry.

 We good? No, we're not good! You really think one little "sorry" makes up for years of, "Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid Flanders"? I'm starting to think you don't want an autograph.

 This is what I want.

 I want you to understand how you make me feel.

 Homer Simpson, you made me less of a man in my sons' eyes.

 Now do you feel remorse? Oh, my God.

 I'm a monster.

 Mm-hmm.

 Wait! You can't go! I need your forgiveness! You can't push a guy around forever, Dad.

 You better take a long, fat look in the mirror.

 I know.

 (Homer groaning) Oh, driveway! Oh! I crawled here on my knees, all the way from my house, to ask for your forgiveness.

 Well, sir, I appreciate that, but I don't bend that easily.

 Well, I'm gonna wait right here on my knees till you change your mind.

 Okily-dokily.

 On my knees! Mm-hmm.

 I hear you.

 Not too comfortable.

 Nor should it be.

   I think he's suffered enough, Daddy.

 And he seems to be sinking.

 We're losing him.

 "And when you stand praying, "if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in Heaven may forgive you your sins.

" That's from that ribbon book.

 Yes, it is, Homer.

 And I forgive you, transgressoreeno.

 Now, Ned, why don't you join us for an all-is-forgiven brunch? Oh, can I make my famous mimosa? A little sparkling water and a glass full of regular water? Stu pendous, Flanders.

 (Homer chuckles) Hey, Miss Drizzle! Otto! Otto! How many tabs did you take? (chuckles) I took a whole sheet of Hello Kitties! Oh, Otto! That will have a most deleterious effect on your brain.

 The cerebrum, the cerebellum, the medulla.

 But why am I telling you about it when we can visit the inside of your head? Bus, do your stuff! (cheering) Aah! Get it out! Get it out! (screaming) MAN: Mr.

 Foreman? Mr.

 Foreman, please wake up! Aah! Who murdered who again? Shh!   


                





                    			 (grunts) D'oh! (grunts) (all scream) Oh, my God, Morty, what did you do? You killed the Simpsons, Morty! Oh, my God, no! No, I-I-I-I didn't mean to! Oh, no, no! This is horrible! I killed the Simpsons! God, look at the baby one! Oh, my God, Morty! You killed the entire Simpsons, Morty! They're a beloved (belches) family, Morty! They're-they're-they're-they're a national treasure.

 And you killed them.

 I-I-I-I'm just a kid! I'm just a kid! I don't want to go to jail! Relax, Morty, calm down.

 We'll take care of it.

 Okay, I want you to take that vial of Simpsons' goo and this picture to this address.

 They'll make us new Simpsons-- you understand me, Morty? Me?! W-W-What are you gonna do? Morty, I got to clean this place up before somebody comes snooping around.

 You know how many characters there are in The Simpsons, Morty? There's, like, a billion (belches): chara characters.

 They did an episode where George Bush was their neighbor.

 All right, can't argue with that.

 (spits) (speaking in native tongue) Hi-diddly-ho, neighbor! Looks like you got a spaceship in your Who are you? Rick, I'm back! Wake up! Wake up! Geez, it's about time, Morty.

 Give me those.

 (grunting, moaning) Huh, wow.

 Hey, Morty, a little tip.

 (belches) Don't clean DNA vials with your spit! Let's go.

 I'm driving this time.

 Aw, no more guest animators, man! Okay, children.

 I think it's safe now to put on your math T-shirts.

 Wait here.

 (grunts) Nerd! Model U.

N.

, and step on it! Ha-ha! (laughing) Very good.

 That is really Oh! Dog in box.

 Genius.

 All right, let's meet our two teams of Mathletes, shall we? First, the Springfield Elementary Action Fractions! They rhyme and they (groans) And, uh, from the right side of the tracks, the Waverly Hills Elementary No Equals.

 They're spoiled and rich.

 Yo! What did the right angle say to the wider angle? Well, not knowing these fellows, I-I couldn't say.

 You're obtuse! (all laughing) (groans) Now, let's welcome our celebrity guests, former winners of this very contest and current high-flying-- yes, you heard me-- I said high-flying, high flying-- tech entrepreneurs! Gary, Doug and Benjamin, who invented Whereditgo.

 That's an app that finds the other apps on your phone.

 Enables you to glayvin with your friends' mobile hoyvin.

 One year ago, we were dateless nerds living in our mothers' basements.

 Now the basement we live in is in a giant mansion.

 Yeah! Yeah! And we own some kind of sports team.

 (laughs) All right, calm down, just calm down.

 Now, here to support these fine student scholars is the man who loves math Math?! I thought you said "meth"! Drug reference! Uh, seriously, what am I here for? Nobody told you? They send a limo, I get in.

 It takes me somewhere.

 Then I watch the news later to see what I did.

 (crowd cheers and applauds) What a nightmare.

 That's fair enough.

 Boo-hayvin! The teams have created introductory videos about themselves.

 Let's watch them, shall we, with our eyes? NARRATOR: Springfield Elementary was originally designed as a storage facility for salt pork.

 At some later point, it was turned into a school.

 CHALMERS: Chalmskinn.

 On hot days, pork grease still comes out of the walls.

 Oh, quit your whining.

 FRINK: And now, Waverly Hills.

 Hi, I'm movie genius Michael Bay.

 I used to be all like, "Math? Who needs that noise, am I right?" But I wasn't right.

 The Waverly Hills math team made me realize that quadratic equations are hotter than a million Megan Foxes.

 Math on! Yo, Waverly Hills! You guys rock! Like my friend The Rock! I know his real first name! It's Dwayne! I win Hollywood! Celebrate now, you stuck-up snobs.

 (cheering) But our plucky little school is going to surprise you.

 We will surprise you all! (cheering) Well, Lisa, we didn't score a single point.

 That was surprising.

 (crying) Oh, you'll get them next time, honey.

 No! No, we won't! That school is so rich! Every kid has a laptop! Her crying is sadder than a child actor "Where are they now?" story.

 LISA: It's true.

 As graduates of Springfield Elementary, we want to give back.

 We're going to buy every student a tablet computer and upgrade your entire school with the latest cloud-based technology.

 Here's a check.

 Take this check.

 NARRATOR: The first black president is decades away from being a reality.

 Come back with my fall semester! We don't need filmstrips like Life in These 48 States anymore, because our school is going all digital! (grunts) GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE: Ow, damn it! The teachers union won't stand for this.

 It means less work for you.

 I didn't know it was possible to do less work.

 How intriguing.

  He said I've been to the year 3000   Not much has changed   Not much has changed   But they lived underwater   Underwater   And your great-great-great granddaughter   Is pretty fine   Is pretty fine   I took a trip to the year 3000   This song had gone multiplatinum   Everybody bought our seventh album  And if we're ever invaded, just click this.

  I took a trip to the year 3000   This song had gone multiplatinum   Everybody bought our seventh album.

  Oh, it's wonderful.

 We can finally afford attractive teachers.

 (groans) I was the only one here who understood osmosis.

 Spare me, ug-o.

 (groans) Willie, since all our books have been digitized, we have no need for the paper versions-- burn these.

 Wouldn't it be easier just to toss them out? Nonsense! We now have this state-of-the-art digital book burner.

 Hmm.

 (laughs) Listen to her hum.

 What's that?! Well, we didn't want to leave you out of the digital revolution.

 Willie, meet your new supervisor.

 Aw, I have to take orders from a machine? Oh, it can't speak.

 But should it ever learn, yes.

 ("Star Spangled Banner" playing) (groans) Will there ever be a technology that teaches stupid children how to ding a dang triangle?! This school has spent the last Let us spend the next 50 mired in now! (singsongy): Bo-Ron! And with this ring, we unite these ancient warring clans, who frolic unclothed, even in winter, and bring peace to Decapita! (screams) Pay cable is awesome! Who knew they had nipples in castle times? You're not supposed to be able to get outside our network! You shouldn't have made your password "password.

" Well, it was the name of the street I grew up on.

 Password Drive! (crackling and buzzing) Seymour, you plugged the servers in with surge protectors, didn't you? Oh, yes, power strips.

 You fool.

 Surge protectors are always power strips.

 But not vice versa! Was that us? No, sir.

 (chuckles) I like it when it's not us.

 (clock ticking) Let's see.

 Roman numerals.

 Photosynthesis.

 Uh, Robert E.

 Lee.

 Miss Hoover, are you teaching or are you just saying anything that comes into your head? Miss Hoover, please report to the main office.

 You just did that in your hand! Ralph Wiggum, put your head down.

 You're the mouth-hand! All right, class.

 We don't have computers and we don't have keyboards.

 But that doesn't mean we can't practice our typing.

 Now, put your index fingers on marshmallows F and J, and tap-tap-tap.

 Tap-tap-tap.

 Tap-tap Nelson, stop that! This is my dinner.

 I'm eating steak.

 Mmm! Mmm! Needs sauce.

 Great news, children.

 I found an educational movie I can play on my phone.

 Crowd in-- it's kind of a little phone.

 NARRATOR: Mathematics! Agriculture! Are there two more exciting words? Since the time of the Romans, they used scythes to kill each other.

 The ancient farmer needed tools to measure his land.

 Ten stick knots right.

 Five left.

 Hmm.

 (humming a tune) (groans) Oh, come to mock ol' Willie, have you? "Ooh, Willie has to work in the hot sun all day.

 Willie's best friend is a stick and a string.

" I'm not here to mock you.

 "Ooh, Willie doesn't know when someone's being sincere!" I'm just here to hang out.

 What's that device you're using? My rummlie scob.

 Nothing exciting.

 Just a measuring stick dating back to the ancient druids.

 Oh! Could you tell me how it works? Each knot marks the length of a sheep's bladder.

 The play field is 75 stomachs by 52 kidneys.

 That's 163 square haggises.

 Move over, metric system! I'm learning the gastric system! Clever.

 Uh, good news, sir, I have assembled a page on "the piglims" at "Rhymouth Pock.

" Yes, well, that's the best we can hope for.

 Uh, apply the transparent tape.

 Principal Skin-ner! Willie has showed me that losing our technology doesn't have to be the end of our learning.

 We can turn our school into a Waldorf school.

 You mean like the hotel? Nope! In elementary school, Waldorf education focuses on hands-on activity and creative play.

 In secondary education Ah, not our problem.

 After sixth grade, it's good-bye and good luck.

 (both chuckling) Yes, yes, it is.

 Well, it sounds good, but I have one more question.

 Is it based on the book where you find the guy in the hat? Where's Waldo? That's not even the name.

 I'm surprised you guys didn't think it was based on the salad.

 BOTH: There's a Waldorf salad? (groans) Behold-- Waldorf education in action! We're getting our hands dirty and learning by doing.

 So I have to make but I only have one pound of hamburger meat.

 How many cubic feet of Styrofoam peanuts should I add? Assuming four peanuts per Joe, Well, you're a smart little fatso.

 It says here that students don't have to raise their hands.

 They should just ask every question that comes to their mind.

 Oh.

 Why are pine needles pointy? And, um-um-um, what's the difference between an asteroid and a meteor? And, mm ooh-ooh! Can you shrug anything other than your shoulders? (sighs) Does anyone else have any questions? Um, if Mommy's purse didn't belong in the microwave, why did it fit? We won't need computers, we won't need books.

 I learned not to drink out of the crick.

 You mean this isn't crick water? My daddy raised me and all my 11 dead siblings on crick water! Huh, everyone wears a hat.

 Sun hats in the summer, wool hats in the winter.

 Ooh, look at this.

 Weekly Friday night parents' meetings.

 Oh Wait.

 There might be a safety hatch.

 Does the apostrophe come before or after the "S" on "parents"? After, which means both parents.

 (groaning) Well, I'm not wearing a hat.

 People might think I'm bald.

 (Homer grunting) Before we share announcements and see the results of grade three's dance study of willows and drooping trees, we greet the day with a school song.

 Now I have to sing a song?! Why did those idiots mix up power strips and surge protectors?  Every single living creature   Every cat and every flea   All things with a facial feature   Have the right to smile at me   Every family is a unit   Sometimes yelling, sometimes mad   Divorced or gay or even foster   Even Billy with three dads.

  I feel like Beethoven when Charles Grodin finally accepted him as his dog.

 This school is so great now.

 Kids learn by doing.

 If it's so great, why aren't you helping your kids do their homework? Bart's here doing it right now.

 No, no, no! Not two-thirds, one-half! Now that's one-third each.

 Now you're learning! (laughs) Enjoy.

 One earthworm Gah! Two halves.

 ALL: Wow! Willie! Willie! They want you to coach our school math team! I'll have to check with my supervisor.

 (dings twice) Good to go! So, if Willie gets paid three cents per square foot for seeding, and if the field is 2,500 square feet, what is Willie getting? I'd say "screwed.

" (groans) You're right! You! Chalmers! Aah! Uh-oh.

 (tires screech) Come back here, you Willie-chiseling cheat! (grunting) (tires screeching) (horn honking) Hey, who threw that egg at a most efficient It was me, sir.

 Kids, meet your new math team captain.

 It's about time.

 But I'm the captain.

 Not anymore.

 I can't see.

 I can't see.

 Welcome to the long-anticipated rematch between Waverly Hills and Springfield.

 (crowd cheering) (grunting) Um, can you tell me which college I should go to? (stammers) It's not a sorting hat! Please! Early applications are due next week! All right.

 Uh, Miami of Ohio.

 (groans) Okay.

 Our first question is a toss-up.

 "What is the least common multiple of six, eight and 16?" Is correct! (all gasp) Whoa! No one said there'd be math! We said there'd be nothing but math! And you're the math team captain! I thought I wouldn't have to do anything.

 You know, like an Italian cruise ship captain.

 You're lucky that captain's not here right now to answer your insult! He'd crash a ship right into your house! Aah! ("Pi" by Kate Bush playing)  Oh, he love, he love, he love   He does love his numbers   And they run, they run   They run him in a great big circle   In a circle of infinity  ESPN isn't covering this.

 D'oh!  Point one, four   One, five, nine   Two, six, five, three, five   Eight, nine, seven, nine   Three, two.

  And so, with the score knotted at 29-all, it comes down to one last question.

 Drawing three straight lines, construct nine non-overlapping-- that's non-overlapping, not overlapping, but non-overlapping-- triangles.

 HOMER: Huh? Ooh.

 (chuckles) I have the answer! (all gasp) As someone whose dad's hair is made of Ms, it's child's play.

 Oh, not this again.

 Whoo-hoo! I'm a solution! The Action Fractions win! You guys might be richer and better looking, but we won a contest to even the series! Mm, that'll look great in our trophy case.

 Willie, build a trophy case.

 Aye, sir.

 But you know what we should really thank for our success? Lower standards! ALL: Lower standards! Aye.

 You're wonderful, Willie.

 You and the ancient Scottish scientist that invented the rummlie scob.

 Well, the truth is, it wasn't invented for science.

 Really? Then what for? Oh, it was used for hanging sheep stealers! The wee knots kept them alive longer to make the punishment more cruel.

 (shudders) Maybe I don't want to know these things.

 Can you say something nice about Scotland? Well, sometimes the fog comes in and covers everything terrible.

 Very atmospheric.

 Oh.

 Shh!   


                





                    			 LISA: Aah! MARGE: Whoo! BART: Wha! (Homer grunts) D'oh! D'oh! (tires screeching)  I don't believe it   When you tell me   That it's all gone bad   It's true   To you  Whoa! (tires screech) (alarm sounding, birds squawking) (alarm continues) (soft groaning, snoring) Huh? Where's the snooze button? Ah, that's better.

 Hey, what? I gotta get out of here! (alarm blaring) It's (yawns) After just five more minutes.

 (yawns) (alarm blaring) (laughing): Oh Marge On a Tuesday? DR.

 HIBBERT: Yet again, Homer will be fine.

 Mm.

 He's been sleeping an awful lot.

 Look at these vacation photos.

 DR.

 HIBBERT: Oh, my! (chuckling) Man, you people sure take a lot of vacations.

 MARGE: That's just to remind me where I parked.

 Hmm.

 I think I have an idea of what might be going on.

 (gasps) Huh? What? First, you're gonna need a spinal tap.

 Please be the band.

 Please be the band.

 Oh! Aren't you supposed to give him anesthetic? Oh, I knew I forgot something.

 (screaming): Ow! (printer whirring) Oof.

 Very low levels of hypocretin.

 I'm afraid Homer has narcolepsy.

 Doctor, is it time to pull the plug on my father? No, wait.

 I'll spare you that painful decision.

 HOMER: No, Bart! That's the TV! Ha-ha! That's the other guy.

 Stop that! (laughs) Narcolepsy's merely sleeping sickness, and many narcoleptics do lead normal lives by avoiding stressful triggers like, uh, oh, let's say Helping with the laundry? Exactly.

 Having to pay my doctor's bill? Don't play with me, man.

 I will mess you up.

 Here's a signed certification of your condition.

 This is a bona fide medical excuse from doing anything you find taxing.

 But you only use that when absolutely necessary, right, Homie? Marge, please! I'll probably never use it.

 Dad, can you drive me to Milhouse's? Narcolepsy.

 There's a spider in my room! Narcolepsy.

 Dr.

 Hibbert called in a prescription for you to pick up.

 Narcolepsy.

 Yes, for narcolepsy, which you should get now.

 You can't spend half your life napping.

 Maggie does, and you think she's adorable.

 Yes, because babies are always cute.

 (snoring) (coughing) (sniffs) Oh, that baby needs a diaper change.

 Nar-co-lep-sy.

 (groans) Homie, you have no idea what it's like being married to you.

 Me being married to me, eh? ("Bridal Chorus" playing) HOMER: Stop the wedding! What about our child? (baby whimpers) (dog barks) Don't forget me.

 Now I've seen everything.

 A window that talks?! Okay, can you explain again how I take this medication? One a day with food.

 Yeah, but what kind of food, girly? Stuffed cabbage, a nice bowl of soup? (sighs) Any idea when you'll get to me? Well, there's four old people ahead of you, so how's Thursday at 1:00? Oh, you know it's funny that you should say one, 'cause that's how many grandchildren that I have.

 I'm gonna have grandchildren by the time I get through this line.

 Oh, that's so nice.

 Isn't that interesting? Oh, well, congratulations.

 (giggles) Narcolepsy, take me away! Oh! (grunts) (groans) (toy squeaks) (sniffing) I smell beer.

 Did you go to Moe's? Every time I have beer on my breath, you assume I've been drinking.

 (groans loudly) Oh, that's a long one.

 Did you at least get the medicine? I tried, and I failed.

 Miserably.

 But I'm willing to work this out in counseling.

 (groans) We've been to every counselor from Avery to Zabinsky.

 But not Zilowitz.

 HOMER: And that's why there'll never be another golfer as good as Chi-Chi RodrÃ­guez.

 The name and the game, he had it all.

 Okay, I think we got a little off-track here.

 I know this marriage isn't perfect, or even great, but now I treasure the moments where it's just so-so.

 (snoring) I'd kill for "okay.

" Please, please, just tell me what to do.

 I've never said this-- and I don't even know if I'm supposed to say this-- but this marriage is rotting with the stench of death.

 Oh, that seems a little strong.

 How about reeking like a trashcan in a dog park? Does my marriage have to be something you can smell? (snoring) You see, Marge? You see? The only way you and Homer will ever be happy is to spend a little time apart, followed by more time apart, followed by a divorce.

 What?! What is What, what's going on? Wait, no, no, no, I remember.

 Happy anniversary.

 Homer, Homer, listen to me.

 There's just so much I can take.

 No, we can save this.

 We'll go to a therapist.

 We're at a therapist! How you doin'? What's going on here? (sobbing) Nothing.

 Everything's fine.

 See? (sobbing continues) I'll love you forever.

 Kids, a professional felt the best way for your father and me to work on our relationship was to give up on it.

 But after a while, Dad's coming back? Oh, yeah, of course.

 Maybe not.

 Oh, Marge, after all my divorce-worthy statements and actions, many of which you don't know about, how can you kick me out now that I'm sick? Narcolepsy is a serious thing.

 Maybe because you didn't take it seriously enough.

 I pity you! (Homer sobbing) (Homer wailing) (crying): Why is Daddy going away? Is it my fault? (crying stops) Just kidding.

 I have been waiting for this.

 All my problems are my parents' fault! Mr.

 Flanders, can I cry on your shoulder? Boys, get my tear dickey.

 BOTH: Yay! (snoring) (alarm beeping) Five more minutes.

 (snoring resumes) Poor guy, living at the plant.

 And yet he's still late.

 (crickets chirping)   (crow cawing) Smithers, come up through my rear and grab me.

 Yes, sir.

 (humming) (blow dryer whirrs, stops) (humming happily) I don't get it, Homer.

 You and your wife may be calling it quits.

 How can you be happy? Oh, you guys missed a very sad montage, but then I remembered that after every fight we ever had, Marge takes me back.

 I wouldn't be so cocky, Homer.

 Marge has changed her relationship status to "It's complicated.

" (whistles) Not good.

 Complicated? What's complicated? We're not together, but we're not legally apart, and I have to fight for the right to see the children I spent my life avoiding.

 What's complicated about that? Simpson, where are your shoes? Narcolepsy.

 Oh, sorry, sorry.

 Now, to prove everything is fine, I'm just going to give Marge a call.

 MARGE: Hello, you've reached the voicemail for Marge Bouvier.

 (beeps) Oh, my God.

 She switched to her maiden name.

 She must be serious.

 She's gonna have to order new checks.

  fight, The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show!  (doorbell rings) Eh? Mm! (cackling) Use a coaster.

 Oh, the pigeon sisters! (Pigeon Sisters cooing) Wish my head was filled with guacamole.

 Now, on the bright side, Homer, guys get in much better shape when they get divorced.

 Not me.

 I will not become a clichÃ©.

 Well, consider yourself lucky.

 Most guys never even get a chance to lose an amazing woman like Marge.

 If Marge is in play, I'm cleaning up.

  Got a date with an angel   Got to meet her at 7:00.

  (belches) Hey, guys, knock it off, huh? I'm sure Homer and Midge just need to talk things out there.

 (phone rings) And there she is now.

 Hello, baby.

 Y Oh, it's the pharmacy.

 They want me to pick up my prescription.

 (sighs) Well, that man just won the Saddest Man in the Bar competition.

 I was so damn close! Whoa, nice fill.

 You've got amphetamines, anticataplectics and GHB, also known as Georgia Homeboy or Liquid Ecstasy.

 Do not take these with alcohol.

 What if I've already been drinking, and I don't plan to stop? Are you asking me out? I mean, you're not, but it seems like you'd be fun to hang with, and I'm pretty fascinating myself; I'm an author.

 I thought you worked in a drugstore? Tennessee Williams worked in a shoe factory.

 Boy, you're pretty fast with that fact.

 You want to go out or not? Well, I don't know what you see in me.

 I'm just a lonely guy with a bag full of drugs.

 Huh! Come with moi.

 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You're moving way too fast for me.

 I get that a lot.

 (sighs) No, what I'm saying is you're walking faster than I can walk.

 How fast can you go? Pretend you're walking a very slow old dog.

 (both growling, barking) (rock music playing) No autographs.

 I just need you to sign your bill.

 The monkey made the reservation.

 He pays.

 I think it's cool how you owned your own baldness by shaving your head.

 Well, I saw a picture of Jeffrey Katzenberg once, and said, "Yes, that's for me.

" Okay, listen, I'm just floating this, but have you ever thought that it might be a good thing Marge dumped you? What are you saying? You guys were so young when you met.

 She was your first girlfriend.

 I've dated more girls than you, but now you're free to try something new.

 Uh it's getting late.

 I should go.

 The donut shop will be throwing out their unsold donuts.

 You can buy them cheap.

 Don't you want to finish your drink? Eh, you're the pharmacist.

 Whoa  Big city   Bright lights   Cool, cool people   Big city    (Homer laughing, heads laughing) (Patty and Selma chuckle) (gagging) (grunting)   Mm! (laughing groggily) Hey What? Candles? Clean sheets.

 Did I pass out at Urban Outfitters? Oh, God! Oh, God! I've just committed the one drunken mistake I've never made.

 Well, Bart.

 Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

 What am I gonna tell Marge? (gasps) Don't move! There's a snake on your butt.

 That's a tattoo.

 Why would you do that to your body? I thought you had one, too.

 Those are stretch marks, young lady.

 I've had three children.

 I got to call my wife.

 I thought you guys were separated.

 I'm the kind of man who never gives up hope.

 I own property in Detroit, every Christmas I ask for size 36 pants, and I still buy Beanie Babies.

 (phone beeps, line rings) Hello, Homer.

 Marge is getting ready for a date.

 Marge? On a date? Yep, but I'll make you a deal.

 I will try to save your marriage if you can guess which one I am.

 Patty? Wrong! (dial tone) (sobbing) I'm gonna get one, two, three, four, five scones.

 You guys want anything? We're fine.

 No, thanks.

 We're all right.

 Candice, what is his deal? (gasps) Is he paying your rent? No.

 Is he giving a kidney to your mother? No.

 Is he good at sitting on suitcases that are too full? Yes, but no.

 Is he your guest at a dinner for schmucks? No.

 (gasps) Are you a Humpty Dumpty catcher? Be honest.

 All no.

 Does her remind you of a childhood snowman? Yes, that's it! And the great thing is he will never melt.

 Man, I would love to get back into snowman shape.

 I can't even fit in my scarf anymore.

 Whoa, this is serious.

 Complimentary tattoos.

 Yeah, I've always been looking for the very special lady who would match up with this.

 (whinnying) All right, very funny.

 You two celebrating or what? Two Scorpinos, Moe.

 Scorpinos, you got it.

 And those are served in, uh Champagne flute.

 Champagne flute, got it.

 And that is a Glass! A clean glass.

 Ah, coming right up there, Your Highness.

 Nut case.

 (engine revs, tires squeal) Wow, Homer, you really stuck the landing after your separation.

 Yeah, it's great.

 Except her friends are always over.

 I've been there for three weeks, and I can't find the TV.

 And no one has any problems, except they talk about them endlessly.

 Kind of like you're doing now? And the weirdest thing of all is now she wants me to meet her dad.

 Wow, who pays for that dinner? I plan to pretend there's a bug in my food and get the meal for free.

 Smooth.

 H-Hello, sir.

 Thank you for inviting me to dinner, sir.

 Homer, relax.

 I have no problem with the age difference between you and my daughter.

 In fact, I've been dating a much younger woman myself.

 Oh, here she comes now.

 (humming happily) (gasping) Okay, okay, we can be adults about this.

 Waiter, champagne? (sputtering) So I can't date an older man, but your girlfriend can? She's not my girlfriend.

 Candice and I don't use labels.

 Mm, doesn't look like she uses that much shampoo, either.

 Lay off my girlfriend! Roger is great with the kids.

 He even taught Bart how to bunt.

 Oh, so now you're super dad? When I was a kid, you were never around.

 You missed my high school play.

 You told me not to come.

 You're supposed to fight me on that! Well, Marge, your Roger's not so perfect now.

 He's got a screwed up daughter with a pathetic boyfriend.

 Candice, dear, I apologize.

 I'm trying so hard to set my life right.

 Oh, speaking of which.

 Marge, I am going to do something I should've done three weeks ago when I met you.

 Will you marry me, Marge? Yes.

 As soon as my divorce is final.

 Then you can put a ring on my finger, Homer.

 I'm already pregnant.

 You're pregnant?! But I kept my shirt on! (echoing): No! (snoring) Huh? What am I doing here? Sleeping through our therapy session.

 Dreaming only about you.

 So none of it happened? We're still together? Somehow.

 Whoo-hoo! And you thought our only option was to break up.

 I never said that.

 If I told people that didn't belong together they shouldn't be together, I'd be out of a job.

 Huh, I must have dreamed that, too.

 Okay, why don't you tell us more about this dream? All you need to know about my dream is that Marge and I have been completely turned around by it, and like Scrooge, I will demonstrate I have learned my lesson by making a boy run to the store and buy me a goose.

 I think you're going to have to do a little more, Homer.

 Oh, I'll do a lot more than a little more! I'll do some.

 If you could just be good for a month, that would really show me something.

 Absolutely.

 Can the month be February? Okay, March.

 (groans) You did it, Homie! And what a March it was.

 A beautiful Easter, a sober St.

 Patrick's Day, and impeccable behavior watching the NCAA basketball tournament.

 Mm-hmm! And with your love, Dad, I'm eating meat and Maggie's talking.

  I see trees of green   Red roses, too  What the? MALE SINGER (rock beat):  I see them bloom   For me and you   And I say to my  Aah! Huh? Huh? Huh? I got you one of those beers you enjoy unironically.

 This won a blue ribbon in 1890? What does that mean? Wait, so this is reality? That other dream was just a dream? Noooooooo! But you forgot to pay! (distant): Oh! (whimpering) (gasps) (sobbing) I've lost everything.

 My wife, my family (sobbing) You didn't lose me, Dad.

 (chuckles) Lisa? You can never lose me.

 We share the same blood, the same mixed feelings towards Bart, and you know I'll need support in my teenage war with Mom.

 (sobbing, laughing): Oh, Lisa (both laughing) Oh, Dad.

 Dad! Aw, sweetie Nothing could ever come between us.

 we'll be together forever.

 ROGER: Lisa, where are you, dear? I thought we'd get in a game of chess before we go pony shopping.

 Gotta go.

 Lisa! I'll Skype you at Christmas! (echoing): Noooo! (Homer snoring) Huh, so it was all my dream.

 I better find out what this all means.

 It means, like all married women, sometimes you're sick of your husband, but sometimes you're afraid of losing him.

 And like all married men, I didn't hear that first thing, and I'm overconfident of the second.

 So what do we do? I need some kind of guidance to take away from all of this.

 Put your finger on it so I can tie it in a bow.

 Please? Well, one thing we therapists can give is concise, simple solutions, and yours is Hannah, what does that one mean? It means don't get drunk in Brooklyn.

  I see babies cry   I watch them grow   They'll learn much more   Than I'll ever know   And I think to myself   What a wonderful world   Yes, I think to myself   What a wonderful world   A wonderful, wonderful   A wonderful, wonderful world   A wonderful, wonderful   Wonderful world!  Shh!   


                





                    			 Today's safety film Don't Wear Jewelry During Sports has been cancelled.

 Instead we'll watch a movie that made me fall in love with showing movies I've watched to other people.

 (kids booing) (exclaiming) That's right, the 1967 classic Doctor Dolittle, which answers the question: what if an elderly unmarried doctor decided to focus his practice on animals? The running time is 152 minutes! The running time is now! (horse neighing) (neighing) (neighing continues) (groans) He's been giving that horse an eye exam forever.

 (neighs) MILHOUSE: It's a carrot, stupid! Isn't it a pity you're a seal? (seal grunts) KIDS: Ew! That dude's making it with a fish! I kissed a light socket once, and I woke up in a helicopter.

  This is the world of Dr.

 Dolittle   The wonderful world of Dr.

 Dolittle  This is Anthony Newley at his worst.

 (singing along):  Where crocodiles talk   And elephants sing   And animals do most any old thing.

   My friend the doctor   And me.

  That movie was so bad, it actually stinks.

 (sniffing) Whoa, it's not the movie.

 It's Bart! (kids sniffing) (kids clamoring in disgust) I don't stink.

 You're just smelling the old boogers in your noses.

 You got to pick those things-- it's called hygiene.

 If I may join in the mockery, Lisa Simpson also has an appalling odor.

 (kids sniffing) What? (gasps) I don't smell.

 Girls don't smell! (deep sniff) Sorry, girl, but you smell.

 (singsongy): Stink-sons! Stink-sons! KIDS (singsongy): Stink-sons! Stink-sons! Children can be so cruel.

 ALL (singsongy): Stink-son! Stink-son! Then they called me Stink-son.

 That's not even my name.

 What happened? Our family's been ostracized for lots of things, but never our hygiene.

 Rarely our hygiene.

 Never my hygiene! (groans) I think I know where the smell is coming from.

 Mold.

 (groans) It's worse than a Grampa hug in the summer.

 I thought smelly clothes only happened to working mothers.

 This is all the money I've found in Homer's pants pockets over the years.

 I was saving it to buy a spice rack instead of always renting one.

 But I guess we'll have to spend this money on a new washing machine.

 We cannot continue on as the Stink-sons.

 Oh, Stink-sons! (laughing) Hey! When I return, we will no longer have to wear attic clothes.

   (humming) (bell dings) Mmm smoked meat.

 Mmm! (sniffing) (horns blaring) Move it, fat ass! I'm trying to text! Oh, I spilled my pee jar! Watch it, Stink-son! A roadside barbecue stand? Everything tastes better when it's near a road.

 Try a taste.

 Guaranteed to blow your mouth's mind.

 Mmm.

   (laughing) Oh, look at 'em go! (laughing deliriously) (laughing) Ooh, charred and moist! Like Satan's burps.

 The grill marks are shaped like a honeycomb! That's why I call her the Hive.

 She's been passed down through my family for generations.

 They say the Hive's made from a meteor which burned off my great-grandpappy's beard, exposing his weak chin to the entire township.

 (laughter) (grunts) It was a gift from the heavens.

 The perfect smoker.

 The Hive has never been cooled down, never been cleaned.

 Mixing meat, fat and smoke into pure magic.

 Mmm smoked me.

 You look like a man who needs a smoker in his life.

 It just so happens that the Hive is available for purchase.

 (gasps) But why would you give up your most prized possession? That'd be like Stephen Hawking selling his talking motorcycle.

 My old lady and I are saving up to live our dream of moving further away from our grandchildren.

 (moans) But if I don't come home with a washing machine, my wife will be so mad.

 Oh, should I do the thing I'm supposed to do or the thing everybody knows I'm gonna do? You bought a grill?! It's not a grill.

 It's a smoker.

 That you can grill on.

 That money was supposed to de-stink our children, and instead you bought a doo-hickey to stuff your greedy face.

 (groans angrily) Don't worry, Homer.

 Nothing fixes bad times like good food.

 Also, I died.

 Hmm.

 (groaning angrily) (sniffing) Huh? Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! I can't believe you cooked this.

 Well, the secret to barbecue is sitting around doing nothing.

 No wonder I'm great at it.

 Mmm smoky carrot.

 And, Maggie, this is for you.

 (squeals) Come on, just one bite.

 Nah-uh! Uh-huh.

 Never! Ever.

 Forget it.

 Remember it.

 No way, Jose! SÃ­ way, Josefina.

 Nothin' doing.

 Everythin' undoing.

 Oh, fine! One bite.

 (gasps) Ooh! (laughing excitedly) Homie, I finally understand gluttony.

 Welcome to America, baby.

 (barking) Sorry for dropping by, but we smelled your barbecue and couldn't resist.

 Here's some Carl-slaw to go with it.

 I call it "Carl-slaw," because I bought it.

 (grunting) (excited chattering) Look how popular we are.

 That smoker is the best thing that ever happened to us.

 Thank goodness for your selfish choices.

 I make them all for you.

 (tires screeching, people exclaiming) (excited chattering) Yeah, I'm looking for a barbecue bozo name of Homer Simpson? Whoa, that's Chew Network's celebrity chef Scotty Boom! He's the host of Side Dish Impossible, Master Prison Chef and Kill It, Chill It, Grill It.

 Yeah, how you doing, everybody? I'm Scotty Boom, and I'm challenging you to an Eat-down! What's that-- some kind of eat-down? It's my new show where I use my big-time New York City chef skills to obliterate amateur cooks.

 Who would watch such a one-sided farce? I'm in.

 This Eat-down's gonna throw down at the Springfield Barbecue Festival.

 And when I'm done, you're gonna wish you never heard of food! (people oohing) Buy my cookware! (gasps): I'm competing against Scotty Boom! He's got what all great chefs have-- yelling.

 ALL (chanting): Homer! Homer! Homer! You were right, greasy hobo.

 Nothing fixes bad times like good food.

 Up here, I can watch anyone in the world take a shower.

 (grunting) Okay, pork, I'm gonna throw you in that magic smoker for 24 hours and win that cook-off.

 I only wish you could be alive to see it.

 (British accent): Then I suppose this is my last chance to say I love you.

 Aw (gasps) Oh, no! Our smoker's been stolen! Why?! And when?! You didn't lock it up? You fat idiot! I'm out of here.

 (groans) (moans) You'll find the Hive, right? Tell me you'll find my smoker! Ah, don't you worry.

 The Springfield PD is on the case.

 Ah, yeah.

 Uh, well, I wouldn't get your hopes up.

 High-end barbeques like yours are easy pickings.

 Smokeheads grab them at night, clean them up.

 Next thing you know, it's cooking another family's hot dogs.

 Humanity-- what a joke.

 (spits) So, it's gone.

 It's really gone.

 All that's left is the smell of burning hickory and three tiny little wheel prints.

 Good night, sweet prints.

 So you lost your grill.

 Snap out of it, you big fat baby.

 Son, this is so much more than just losing an outdoor cooking device.

 How to explain this to a child? This is the death of hope.

 What are you talking about? Everything good that comes into our lives, the universe takes away.

 So from now on, I'm just gonna lie here and never care again.

 Come on, you know your life sucks.

 Just get drunk like you always do.

 I don't want to.

 (gasps) (moans) Look at him.

 He's lying there like a beached whale waiting to explode.

 Maybe we should try to track down that smoker.

 I don't know.

 The whole barbequing scene is pretty pro-meat.

 And all that smoke pollutes the environment.

 This isn't about your boyfriend, the planet.

 I've never seen him this beaten down.

 Okay, look for clues.

 Are there any mud samples we can trace to local heaths and moors? Sorry, I've been watching a lot of Sherlock.

 (barking) Knock it off, boy.

 I don't have any meat for you.

 Get down! Wait! Santa's Little Helper was in the yard last night when the smoker was stolen, but he didn't make a peep.

 Why? (gasps) "Natural Peanut Butter.

" What if someone gave this to the dog so he'd be licking instead of barking while they took the smoker?! (gasps) You got a clue, boy! A clue! (laughs) Who's a smart dog? Who's a smart dog? (panting) (barking) (panting) (bell clangs) ANNOUNCER: You're watching Eat-down with Scotty Boom.

 Come on, Homie.

 We can't let this Empire State jabroni beat us.

 This week I took on the Gilbert family of Portland, Maine.

 They've been making clam chowder for generations.

 How is that better than something I spent a day on? I win! Manhattan chowder, baby! NYC! Greatest city, greatest chowder! The Gilbert family has learned a valuable lesson-- screw everything.

 Dad, we're gonna find that smoker! To try is to fail! There's only one store in town that sells all-natural peanut butter.

 (bell dings) Don't worry, I know how to talk to these people.

 Thank goodness you have organic fennel.

 The fennel at the farmer's market is only transitional.

 (groans) Typical.

 Small farmers ruining it for the really small farmers.

 So, could you maybe tell me who bought this brand of peanut butter? Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry.

 You want me to violate my customers' privacy? Who are you working for? The NSA? Big pharma? Amazon Prime? Tell us! Tell us! Tell us! Tell us! (moans) My hoops! (grunting) My ridiculous flesh hoops! There! Someone's ringing up peanut butter.

 (both gasp) Nelson! What are you playing there, Nelson? Clash of Castles? So what if it is? Your castle's pretty well-defended.

 Level six catapults.

 Level seven sorcerers.

 Maxed-out trolls.

 (whistles) Uh, yeah, well.

 (clears his throat) Yeah, gets the job done.

 I tell you, those are some nice upgrades.

 Expensive upgrades.

 Upgrades like that cost gems.

 And gems cost cash.

 Expensive cash.

 Where'd you get the cash, Nelson? I don't use gems! I'm a grinder! A grinder! (grunts) (yelling) (both moaning) (moaning continues) (gasps) (whimpering) (both scream) What are they? They're like televisions but they just keep going! He's meeting with someone.

 That's always a sign of guilt.

 Hope you don't mind.

 I cooked some dinner on it.

 Mmm.

 (sniffs) Ah, smell you later.

 ("Take the A Train" by Duke Ellington ringtone plays) (phone beeps) This is our chance.

 BOTH: Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! (gasps) (tires squealing) (crickets chirping) (groans) (both groan) The universe does hate us.

 It feels good to surrender.

 (all groan) Good girl, Maggie.

 Give up young.

 (panting, barking) (all groaning) Get up off that floor! We are on a head-to-head cook-off that'll be shown on TV and probably some planes.

 We don't have the smoker.

 Just let us forfeit with dignity.

 We still have to try.

 This isn't a family of quitters.

 Sure we are.

 We always have been and more so now.

 I'm a quitter.

 And I'll back down to anyone who says I'm not.

 Come on, Buddhists aren't quitters.

 Actually, Mom, Buddhism is really just quitting in yoga pants.

 This is a Live Strong bracelet.

 Lance Armstrong never quit.

 He never quit the Tour de France.

 He never quit lying about his steroid use.

 And he still hasn't totally come clean.

 Now get in the car! (lively chatter) MOE: Eat-down! Eat-down! Eat-down! Yee-haw! I can handle this barbeque competition.

 All I need is a little help from an old friend.

 I'm Alton Brown and welcome to Eat-down! Today Scotty Boom takes on the Simpsons in (bell clanging) And I can tell you this-- it will be edited to be dramatic.

 Marge, do you think your meat has what it takes to win this Eat-down? It sure does.

 Homer, what about you? No way in hell.

 What about you kids? Are you pumped up to beat Scotty Boom? Happiness is an illusion.

 What she said.

 Looks like the Simpsons are playing mind games with you, Scotty.

 Are you feeling the pressure? No pressure.

 I'm throwing down the taste of New York.

 My recipe's infused with Times Square, the Bronx Zoo and the Sex and the City walking tour.

 The Simpsons better bring their A game.

 HOMER: F! F game! I call this my Never-Give-Up Brisket.

 The secret ingredient is hope.

 Mm? (spits) How many spices did you put in this? All of them.

 (all groaning) (audience oohing) I've never seen such unusual grill marks.

 This pattern looks like a honeycomb.

 What? That meat was cooked on the Hive! This garlic-sucking tunnel trash stole our smoker! Ah, this little flyover's crazy.

 I cooked that meat myself right here over here.

 The grill marks don't match.

 Dead meat doesn't lie.

 (audience gasping) (gasping) Scotty Boom, you are hereby banned from the Chew Network.

 You are no longer a celebrity chef.

 You're just a chef.

 Take him away, Chief.

 Grand theft smoker.

 Sounds like a crime to me.

 Apparently, the winner of the Eat-down is the Simpsons.

 (cheering) Isn't this a little too easy? Why would a professional chef cheat? And how does Nelson fit in? And where the heck is our smoker? ("Take the A Train" by Duke Ellington ringtone plays) (phone beeps) That's the ringtone from the scrapyard! LISA: Get him! Bones! Bones! I'm covered in death! (gasps) My hoops! Dad, stop him! I'm done trying.

 Dad, please! No one's asking you to care.

 Just trip a stranger! (grumbles) A kid? Why'd you steal our smoker? Why'd you frame Scotty Boom? 'Cause he's my dad.

 I'm Tyler Boom.

 Huh? My dad is so busy shooting his TV shows and going to the openings and closings of his restaurants I never see him.

 You destroyed your Dad's career so he'd spend more time with you? Aw I met this kid Nelson playing Clash of Castles online.

 You know, I knew my dad was coming to your town, so I hired Nelson to take your smoker.

 And then my nanny cooked some meat on it and switched it so it looked like my dad cheated.

 This was the only way.

 The only way I thought of.

 Son, why didn't you tell me I was a terrible father? Because I'm from New York.

 We don't talk about our feelings, huh? Yeah, I understand, son.

 I'm from New York, too.

 FDR Drive.

 The West Side Highway.

 Investment banking.

 The gallery scene.

 Knicks suck.

 (crying): Oh, Papa! They suck so hard! One more thing, Tyler.

 Where's the Hive? (gasping) Oh (sizzling) You're always so much hotter than I think you're gonna be.

 Thanks, guys, for not giving up, then giving up, then not giving up again, then I forget.

 BBQ is like family-- the cheap cuts of meat that nobody wants.

 But if you treat them right, they turn into the best thing in the world.

 Yeah, barbecue's yummy.

 Chinese is pretty good, too.

 Meh, it depends on the place.

  From the dusty mesa   Her looming shadow grows   Hidden in the branches   Of the poison creosote   She twines her spines up slowly   Towards the boiling sun   And when I touched her skin   My fingers ran with blood.

  PIT MASTER: I'm out of here.

   


                





                    			 (cackles) D'oh! (tires screeching) (grunts) (all groan) ANNOUNCER: Nocturnal cravings.

 A positive ultrasound.

 How could this woman's doctor not know she was pregnant? (gasps) A baby.

 An astronaut baby.

 (baby laughs) Hey.

 Oh, have you ever turned on a TV? It's my mother's birthday.

 And you only turn 80 once.

 Or, in the case of most people, no times.

 Now, put your good clothes on.

 I'm already in a dress and pearls, and I'm eight years old.

 Can't we go to her 81st birthday? That's the big one.

 Why does visiting my family always have to be so hard? Because, face it, Marge, your family doesn't like me.

 Never did, not even when I had hair and a future and a bitchin' Pontiac GTO.

 Where is that car, Homer? I went to a music festival, and I couldn't remember where I parked it.

 (playing weakly):  I'm a space cowboy.

  Homie, I feel about my family like you felt about that car.

 No one loves a person that much.

 Please go, for me? All right, but remember the signal.

 If I tug my ear, it's time for us to leave.

 I'm switching to my left ear because of what happened last time.

 Uh-uh, no you don't.

 Your grandmother knit this for you, so act like you wear it all the time.

 (groans) She has a juice box.

 Why can't I have a juice box? Because when she sticks in the straw, she doesn't slip and hit an artery.

 Oh, I'll never have juice.

 ALL:  Happy birthday to you   Happy birthday, dear   Mom   Grandma   All of the above  ALL:  Happy birthday to you.

  Thank you.

 Jacqueline, I took the money I usually give to con artists and preachers and bought you these flowers.

 Oh, nothing tops a simple romantic gesture.

 Except a rich man flaunting his wealth.

 The one thing I can't beat-- competition.

 (pops loudly) Oh, Jacqueline, I fell in love with you the moment I came down with dementia.

 So to win your heart, I got you an old-fashioned music player.

 Meh.

 (groaning) Mr.

 Yo-Yo Ma.

 (gasps) No one said there'd be music.

 There's always room for cello.

 (plays Cello Suite No.

 1 by Bach) I know when I'm licked, Burns.

 She's yours.

 Um, not interested.

 I just don't want you to have her.

 Wow, that's the meanest thing I ever heard, and I used to practice cello on the subway.

 D'oh! I'm next! Whee! (Bart and Lisa laugh) Hey, you two, quit having fun.

 Trust me, nothing I've done today has been fun.

 Hey, hey, the plastic's here for a reason-- to keep the couch clean.

 Watch and learn, boy.

 VoilÃ , now I take a simple napkin and (screams) (all groan) Who's ready to see some slides of us as teenagers? (groaning) Here are the slides.

 Oh, just one box.

 Five terabytes.

 That's over 50,000 carousels of family fun.

 (groans loudly) Here's us walking up the steps of TeotihuacÃ¡n's pyramid of the sun.

 Walking, walking, stopping, walking.

 Walking, walking, walking.

 (groans) Ooh.

 Hmm.

 Stopping, stopping.

 Oh.

 Walking, walking, walking, walking, blister-popping.

 Huh? Walking, walking.

 (groans) Stopping, walking, walking Oh, I sure miss Dad.

 We're here to watch old photos, not reminisce.

 Walking, walking How did Grampa Bouvier die? No one's ever told us.

 You know what, I actually don't know.

 Me neither.

 Not a clue.

 Girls, I'm afraid I didn't tell any of you for a reason.

 (gasping) (plays dramatic tune) The real story, and it was something people were ashamed to say at the time, is that he died of lung cancer.

 Mom, how could you know that and still let us smoke? I thought it made you look cool.

 Hey, Lis, do you think I can climb walls like Spider-Man with denture cream on my hands? (screams) Nope.

 Next time, you should wait for my answer.

 Knock it off, your grandmother's bathroom is not a toy chest.

 Ooh, Vicodin.

 I think it's time, Selma dear.

 Time we quit smoking.

 Well, anyway, happy birthday.

 (meows) Man, I can't believe your sisters stopped smoking.

 I just hope they don't put on weight.

 Hmm.

 You're so fat! (laughs) You're even fatter.

 Damn straight.

 No one out-fats me.

 Time for beddy-bye.

 Now, don't sleep on your stomach.

 Or is it your back? Can never remember.

 Whichever is the comfortable one, don't do that.

 (tapping)   (chatters) (hoots) (imitating Duffman): Say hello to fun.

 Oh, yeah! Oh, no! Hoppy! In this house Maggie is safe.

 (Maggie babbles playfully) (groans) Excuse me, I'd like a license to operate heavy machinery.

 We don't do that here.

 Please? To me, everything is heavy.

 (grunting): No.

 (groans) Patty, what are you doing? Selma quit smoking, and she's never been nicer.

 Here's your new license.

 Under "eyes," I put "red and dilated.

" Ooh, thank you, sir.

 Selma, not smoking hasn't affected you at all.

 How is that possible? I even smell cigarette smoke when it's not around.

 (sniffs) Like right now.

 Maybe you're having a stroke.

 Phantom smells are a symptom.

 Eh, what's the penalty for driving a tractor drunk through a Renaissance Faire? Can't help you-- I might be having a stroke.

 I have to consult a competent medical professional.

 Got that.

 Got that.

 (groans) Who doesn't have that? (groans) Anyone here to get an ambulance license? That would be me.

 Here you go.

 I lied.

 (growls) Patty, all your tests are positive.

 I mean, negative.

 Always get those two confused.

 You're fine.

 (chuckles) But I still smell smoke.

 (sniffs) That's odd.

 So do I.

 Do you smell anything, Selma? Hmm, uh-uh, nope.

 Wait a minute.

 Are you smoking? That's right, I am.

 I quit for only ten minutes before I relapsed.

 And it was the best cigarette of my life.

 (scoffs) I have never been angrier at you.

 Me, too-- this is a hospital.

 If you want to smoke, go do it in the stairwell with the doctors.

 I'll miss you so much.

 Leave me Jub-Jub.

 Fine.

 At least you still smoke.

 I hate it when you and Selma fight.

 Me, too.

 I also hate it when they agree.

 Homer, please be nice.

 Patty's our guest.

 For how long? Where's she gonna sleep? On our couch.

 That's where we do our couch gags! See? Oh, fine.

 She'll stay with the baby.

 Well, Magster, it looks like you and I are going to be cellmates.

 (chuckles) (buzzing) (screams) Nature! Shoo! Shoo! I've got a hot curling iron! Hold this.

 (grunts) Oh, Marge, the kids are all asleep and the dog's been walked.

 There's only one thing left to do.

 (sexy purr) Did you turn the security alarm on? It's still broken.

 Ooh, well, then come here, you.

 (Patty snoring) (shouts) What the hell was that?! It's just my sister snoring.

 She has a very fatty septum.

 But it doesn't have to ruin our fun.

 (snoring continues) (both moaning) (gasps, coughs) (owl hooting) (snoring) (music playing intermittently) Okay, which of you kids knows how to drive? And which is sober? Whew, thank God for Designated Dorothy.

 (engine starts, truck backfires) All right, everybody go to bed.

 Those of you who got to get up early, sleep on top of the pile.

 Hey, Brandine! I caught us a possum! You want to name it before we eat it or after? During! Beauregard, you've been promoted from guarding my family to guarding this possum.

 That's a good dog.

 Lift with your legs.

 Hmm.

 Hey, baby.

 How about that rain check for last night? PATTY: Aah! Aah! Aah, don't look at me! But you're everywhere! (gasping) Freak! (shouts) Don't you ever knock? Aah ah! Get out of here, go away! Thank God I'm blind.

 Yo, I'm next.

 No! Whoa! What the hell? I did that with love, boy.

 What's all the hubbub? Oh, thank you, Dad.

 It's okay, son.

 Thank you, thank you, thank you! It's okay, it's okay.

 No, really, thank you, thank you, thank you! It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

 All right, already! Just take a shower.

 I need someone to talk to.

 Thank God I've got a past full of lonely men to draw from.

 Mm-hmm.

 Disco Stu is over you.

 Oh, Disco Stu needs a Zoloft or two.

 (grunts) Who am I kidding? The one I should be talking to is the one who's always been there for me my cigarette.

 Forget about your sister.

 You've got me.

 For the rest of your life I'll be the first thing you think about every morning.

 And the last thing you do every night.

 Hmm, looks like I have a choice to make.

 (grunting) Oh! I'm in your hair! (laughs) Uh (clears his throat) Listen, about this morning, I'm sorry I walked in on you! (grumbling) Oh! Oh, yeah.

 I'm about to say something I never thought I'd say to you-- something nice.

 Hmm? (sighs) I only mock you because I'm jealous of what Marge has in you.

 I only have Selma.

 And now I don't even have that.

 (deep sigh) Oh, Patty, I've waited so long for you to open a window of niceness.

 (grunts) That was it! Window shut! (doorbell rings) Ah, what the heck! Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew! Aah ah! What are you doing here? Apologizing.

 And I want you to know I quit smoking for good.

 You quit for me? I quit for us.

 Hmm, that's actually more selfish.

 But it sounds really nice.

 (grunting) Okay, Maggie, throw the ball to me.

 Throw the ball.

 Okay, how about I throw the ball? It's okay.

 You'll learn to do things after you're a baby.

It's a bunch of animals acting like humans! Oh, well, there goes our dinner.

 And I had such a delightful moonshine pairing for it, too.

 Got 91 points from Robert Trailerparker.

 Dang.

 Okay, well, uh, possum's gone.

 But you got fingernails to chew on.

 Who knows what's under them? Ooh, I got pizza! I got poop.

 It's nice to have you back, Patty.

 I had to do some things I regretted 'cause you were gone.

 You said it was for real this time.

 I said what you wanted to hear! Disco Stu is back on Tinder.

 (door closes) It's nice to be back.

 Since I've stopped smoking, my sense of smell has really come back.

 Uh-huh.

 Who knew a small apartment with two women, a baby and an iguana would smell so bad? Cigarette? Yes! Ah.

 Here's to smoking and you.

 Two things that'll always be in my heart.

 Is this a happy ending? It's edgy.

  Together forever and never to part   Together forever, we two.

  (squawks) Hoppy, you're back! (Cletus' voice): Hey, Brandine! Put out the fancy possum china! I've heard of wanting a cracker, but becoming one-- oh, no! ("The Simpsons Theme" by Yo-Yo Ma playing) Shh!   


                





                    			 Okay, Homie, I'm plugging it in.

 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! The gravestones could be a little more crooked.

 Oh! And light it up.

 (wolf howls) Bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh.

 Halloween at the Simpsons'.

 What a classic tradition! Are you heading up to the tree house to tell three horrifying tales? Ah, we're doing it next week.

 It's gonna be Psycho with Skinner and his mom, Muppet Wizard of Oz-- I'm Scarecrow-Fozzie-- and then, uh, one where furniture gets smart and takes over the world or something.

 Mmm! Sounds chilling! Eh.

 People love it.

 Everscream Terrors looks amazing this year.

 I've never seen black cats with such arched backs.

 Well, you gotta bring it.

 Halloweening your house is a dying art.

 More and more people are turning off their porch lights and pretending they're not home.

 Halloween skippers.

 Skippers! How can you reject a holiday where you can serve candy from a salad bowl? Bad news, Dad.

 You stored the plastic skeletons too close to the furnace.

 Eh, I'll take it to the old folks' home and tell Grampa it's his new roommate.

 Everyone in the car! We're making a skeleton run to the Halloween pop-up store.

 Ooh, while we're there we can get a costume for the dog.

 Nothing says you love a pet like letting him be part of the human fun.

 Who wants to be a Yoda? You want to be a Yoda! Ooh.

 Ooh! Oh, man, I can't wait for tonight! I'm finally old enough for Krustyland Halloween Horror Night.

 Oh, yeah, they do it up right.

 Wait till you try the black cotton candy.

 It tastes just like cotton candy.

 Tomorrow, when my friends ask me about it, I'm going to say, "Eh, it wasn't that big a deal.

" But it's gonna be a really, really big deal! Welcome, seasonal customer, to my pop-up emporium.

 Behold my terrifying joke name.

 A-boo! Hmm, you know, I actually like that better.

 Hey, hey! Why are you not working? 'Cause I'm still coming down from huffing all that glow stick juice, man.

 Oh, I'm strung out on silly string.

 (sneezes) (groans) Go, go! Back to work! Go de-tangle the novelty cobwebs, you lazy trick-or-treat trash.

 (muttering indistinctly) Aren't you being a little hard on them? Mrs.

 Simpson, these are pop-up people.

 Temporary workers who drift from town to town, holiday to holiday, living off candy hearts and sleeping on Easter grass.

 If I do not show them a firm hand, they would rob me like Striped Hamburger Thief robs Restaurant Meat Clown.

 Ooh! Mariachi skeletons.

 They're spooky, but they also teach you about Mexico.

 Psst! Hey, big man, how about this deal: you buy one from me-- in cash-- and I'll load three more into your car for free.

 That is a great deal.

 Just don't tell Old Man Squishee about it.

 Hmm.

 (grunting and chuckling) You got some great guys working here.

 They just gave me a really good deal.

 Really? Tell me of this deal.

 Okay, but don't tell Old Man Squishee about it.

 We hate him.

 Get out.

 Out, all of you! Pop-up scum! Out! No one rips off Apu Nahasapeemapetilon! Now take your suspiciously full duffle bags and go! You're gonna be real sorry for getting us fired.

 Well, I'm sorry now.

 Yeah, you're gonna be.

 I said, I'm sorry now.

 We said you're gonna be! I know when I'm sorry, and I'm sorry now! You guys don't know me at all.

 (Krusty laughing spookily) KRUSTY: Hand stamp required for re-entry! That's not scary.

 I thought this was going to be scary.

 (giggles) (grunts) (growls) Scary! That's really, uh, anatomical.

 Lot of anatomy there.

 Oh, yeah, the gore is super realistic.

 It's gotta be-- today's consumer is just too sophisticated.

 Ah! (screams) (screams loudly) I want to go home! I want to go home! What? No! We just got here! Lisa, honey, I think you should stay.

 And not because the tickets were super expensive, even though they were super expensive.

 But remember, you were really looking forward to the fun of being scared by stuff you know isn't real.

 Unlike the money I spent on this, which is very real.

 Okay.

 Okay, I'll give it another try.

 Good, now take my hand and I'll walk you through this roiling zombie horde.

 (zombies moaning) This isn't real.

 This isn't real.

 This isn't real.

 This isn't real.

 (gasps) (Lisa screams in distance) Sir? Sir? I-I'm not Hold on, Lisa, Daddy's picking out a pretzel topping.

 Sir? Oh Oh, no, I'm lost! Okay, find a grown-up.

 Find a grown-up.

 Excuse me, I'm lost.

 Could you please help me (screams) I can't find my family and I'm really scared and I (screams) (zombies moaning) (mumbling deliriously) Sir, looks like we've got a scaredy-pants situation here.

 Zoom in and scan for fear.

 Terror level seven and rising.

 Shut it down.

 Shut it all down.

 Shut the whole damn thing down.

 SUPERVISOR: Attention! Bring all laughter and exhilaration to a complete stop.

 The terrifying good time is on hold.

 We have located and are removing the baby that thinks this is real.

 Reset time is 65 minutes.

 (groaning, grumbling) All parking validations are now void.

 (grumbling) Sir (whimpering) (crying) Mm-hmm.

 Lisa, aren't you going to wear your costume to school? No, I'm not doing Halloween this year.

 Oh, sweetie, I know you had a scare last night.

 But you worked so hard on your Frida Kahlo outfit.

 Maybe just wear the eyebrow and mustache? No! No! You kids look great.

 Delightful.

 No place like home.

 (chuckles) Hold on, Simpson.

 Let's take a look at that buccaneer costume.

 No weapons, of course.

 Bandana, possible gang wear.

 Eye patch, offensive to the half-blind.

 Oh, and just to reassure those who are afraid of pirates (sighs) (screams) No! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! (panting) Lisa (gasping) (shuddering) Homer I think we should take down Everscream Terrors.

 Wha-- W-We we can't! I'm the Mozart of Halloween decorations, and tonight is the Super Bowl.

 Lisa's in a bad place.

 You know how sensitive she is.

 We don't want her to go back to Tailee.

 No, she wouldn't.

 She couldn't.

 Not Tailee.

 Where is she? (both gasp) HOMER: Oh.

 Oh.

 Ah, let's see.

 (gasps) Oh, God.

 We're too late.

 The glue stick didn't hold.

 So, Tailee's back.

 Hmm.

 Tailee just makes me feel so safe.

 I don't know why I ever gave it up.

 It breaks my heart that Lisa can't deal with her emotions without a crutch.

 Well, kids are weak, Marge.

 Oh, yeah.

 No.

 No! Stop it! Why are you taking down Everscream Terrors? Our house has to be a Halloween-free zone.

 Your sister has a tummy ache in her courage.

 What? Lisa goes nuts and you turn us into into skippers?! I know what this makes us.

 I know! Honey, I knew you'd be upset, and that you'd think only of yourself.

 So I'm taking you to the best trick-or-treating block party in the tri-Springfield area.

 There's a dad who's a deejay.

 Even an E.

T.

 who says your name.

 What if I tell the E.

T.

 my name is a swear? He'll have to say it.

 Then I'm in.

 (sighs) (bowl rattles) NELSON: Haw haw! (sighs) Okay, sweetie, just you and me spending a regular eve together.

 Nothing hallows about it.

 I'm sorry I ruined Halloween, Dad.

 (scoffs) Ruined? Why, you just created a new holiday Puzzle Wednesday.

 A tabby and a calico.

 (chuckles) I wouldn't want to be that ribbon.

 (doorbell rings) Oh, trick-or-treaters.

 Don't worry, I'll get rid of them.

 Trick or treat.

 Porch light's off, kids.

 Don't you know what that means? We're not here for candy, big man.

 Hey, you're those pop-up scuzzos.

 What do you scuzzos want? We want our jobs back.

 Look, I don't want to be rude, but you sad losers should go suck somewhere else.

 (panicked grunting) That? (chuckling): Oh, that was just a kindly priest here to bless our home.

 I told him to keep moving.

 (doorbell rings, Lisa whimpers) (chuckles nervously): Hey.

 Another visitor? Isn't life funny and safe? Can't you jerks take a hint?! Huh? Hmm, hmm? (whimpers) THUGS:  Creepy nursery rhyme   Like in every movie.

  Mind games.

 Whoa, look at this line.

 This neighborhood has to be good.

 Sorry, ma'am, residents only.

 Too many randos crashed the block party last year, so "Spine Chills" is Pine Hills only.

 (whining): Mom, you said we could go here.

 We will, we will.

 Look, I've got a Groupon here for a zip line adventure.

 Let us in, and it's yours.

 Zip-lining is everything to me, but if I take that, I'm not worth the folding chair I'm sitting on.

 Now, turn around and go.

 BART: Aw, a bounce house.

 Aw E.

T.

? E.

T.

: Hello, Scrotum.

 (groaning): Oh.

 It's over.

 I missed Halloween.

 (hums) I can't let Lisa know we're being stalked by vengeful seasonal thugs.

 I'll just whistle a happy tune.

 (whistles theme from Halloween) (humming theme from Halloween) Why are you locking up the house? Why? You've Wh-Why does anything happen? Why are blue jeans blue? Who invented haircuts? (laughs) It's all just stuff I'm saying.

 Oh.

 How did that get there? (muffled scream) Okay, okay, intruders in the house.

 Intruders in the house.

 Got to call the cops.

 Where's my cell phone? They took my cell phone.

 And they forgot to pay my phone bill.

 Wait, why are we going to Mr.

 Flanders' house? Oh, you know, to see his kids.

 I want to finally find out which one is Rod and which one is Max.

 (gasps) Tailee, I left him inside.

 Oh.

 D'oh! Lisa! Lisa! Lisa! LISA: Dad? Oh.

 Oh, Lisa.

 You're here, we're safe.

 Everything's fine.

 Except for this inexplicable fog.

 Boo.

 (screams) (screams) Oh, my God! LISA: Oh, my God! HOMER: (screams) No! (Lisa screams) We got to get out of here! LISA: He smells so bad! Come on, this way! Oh, my God, Dad, help! This way! Come on! Give me a hit off that fog machine.

 We got a fat man to beat on.

 (whooping) MAN: Here we come.

 MAN 2: We're coming to get you.

 (laughter) Okay, okay, I don't think those pop-up guys saw us come up here.

 This isn't real, this isn't real, this isn't real.

 Honey, I'm your dad.

 I've lied to you more times than there are stars in the sky.

 But I got to be straight.

 This is real.

 (whimpers) Okay, Halloween isn't over yet.

 We can still squeeze in some solid trick-or-treating.

 (tires screeching) Hurry, go, go, go! What? What's the rush? Go, go, have fun.

 There's still time.

 (gasps) It's too late.

 The change is upon us.

  The children are all sleeping   Not one kiddie on the streets   The fun's just starting for Mommy and Daddy   Sexy tricks  BOTH:  And boozy treats   Drunken hobbits   Hit on slutty crayons   Policeman dressed as bondage Frankenstein   Your kid's teacher   In a steampunk orgy   Ha   Grown-ups become monsters after 9:00   It's time for grown-up Halloween   Close your eyes if you're under 18   It's my chance to show boobs   Live my fantasy   'Cause tomorrow morning   We won't remember a thing   Our lives are awful and dreary   So tonight we're going way, way, way, way, way too far   Hide your kids   This cannot be unseen   It's naked, wasted, grown-up Halloween.

  (burps) Can't hide forever, thumb-head.

 Sooner or later, you're gonna have to buy Thanksgiving decoration, and we'll be waiting by the Indian corn.

 (clattering) Oh, no, now they're trashing our stuff.

 (chiming) Oh, they've tangled up my wind chimes.

 How will I know when the wind is blowing? (groans) I hate this, I hate feeling afraid.

 Maybe I shouldn't admit this to my daughter, but I'm scared, too, but you can't let fear shut down your brain, because between the two of us, we've only got one good one.

 I've got it.

 What if we use these decorations to signal for help? You're right.

 I may not be the smartest dad or the bravest or the smartest, but I am great at one thing-- drawing attention to our home.

 If we're gonna get out of this, we're going to need every holiday you've got.

  Ay, ay, ay, ay   Halloween is so bueno  Ooh, the SeÃ±or Skeletinos.

 He must have leaned on the "try me" button.

 (laughs maniacally) (taunting): We're coming to get you.

 And no fancy ceiling door is gonna stop us.

 (gasps) (grunts) MAN: Almost got it.

 (grunts) Stuck.

 (grunting) They're coming-- hurry! Time to wake up the neighborhood.

 D'oh! D'oh! (thugs clamoring) Here we go.

 (panting): Hurry.

 Light the fireworks.

 The match won't stay lit-- it's too windy.

 I've got something that will burn.

 (gasps) Are you sure? Yes, this ratty piece of polyester has been soaking in face oil for eight years.

 Light him up.

 Good-bye, Tailee.

 (whistling and popping) (gasping) What the? Huh? Now plug it in! (people gasping) Help, help! Help, we're up here! (muffled speech) Everscream Terrors needs our help! We can get plastered and hit on our coworkers later.

 Come on! Get 'em, Zardoz! (gasping) Sexy drunks, stop them! (groaning) Tragic, really.

 For are these guys not victims, too, in a way, of our disposable pop-up culture? When you get out, look me up.

 I know a guy who owns a 99-cent store.

 Those places are open year-round.

 The holidays will come and go, but (sniffles) we'll stay.

 Grown-up Halloween seemed pretty fun.

 I saw an areola.

 Oh, man, this is the lamest night of my entire miserable Li (gasps) Yes! Everscream Terrors is back! (Bart laughs) Stop it, stop it, this will scare Lisa.

 Boo! (gasping) (giggles) My brave girl.

 I burned Tailee.

 (grunts) (laughs) Foolish Simpsons.

 This was not their typical Halloween experience.

 Wow, cool alien voice, Lenny.

 Thanks, I've been practicing it.

 As a mat (normal voice): Oh, damn it, I lost it.

 (theme from Halloween playing) Shh!   


                





                    			 BART: Trick-or-treat!  On this filthy night of evil   Little gaudy beggars stroll   As they lure ghouls, ghosts and goblins   Hungry for their innocent souls   There is a hellish breeze a-groanin'   As the children they pursue   You can hear their bellies moanin'   They might even gnaw on you   But ruler of this sordid host   More ghastly than them all   Lurks a ravenous beastly monster   More than 25 feet tall  (screaming)  He's dirty and he's hairy   And his mouth tastes just like crap   Like you, he's trick-or-treating for   Some candies to unwrap   The Lord abhors your foul disguise   You thought to cloak your skin   But now you've lured this fiend from Hell   Who craves your soul within   He's hungry for your vitals   He likes you moist and ripe   And should he find you spiced with sin   Then you're his favorite type   He'll chew your juicy insides   Masticate you till you're pulp   Every little soul he'll swallow   With a stinky-ass gulp.

  Ow! (laughs) There's no such thing as ghosts, you dumb kids! (gasps) (bellowing) (screaming) And now it's time for the cartoon.

 STUDENTS: 13! (retching) We have a winner! I didn't throw up, I held it in.

 (retches) No winner! House keeps the money! (phone chirps) Oh, man, I got to see this.

 (groans) (violin playing sad song) Huh.

 Mr.

 Largo? Hmm, something's wrong.

 That music is in tune.

 Hello, Bart.

 (screams) Sideshow Bob! 'Twas I who texted you! Using Milhouse's phone.

 Did you know his wallpaper is American Girl doll? Now let me put this in terms any young boy would understand: you and I have danced a grand pas de deux worthy of Nijinsky.

 But this is the final pliÃ©! Yawn.

 You couldn't kill me with that thing if I drew an "X" on my forehead.

  Bob and his spear gun   Sittin' in a tree   S-U-C-K-I-N  (chuckles) Nice try, Bob, but I'm sure you made some stupid (weakly): mistake.

 Not this time.

 Tell my father he's fat.

 The deed is done.

 to kill a ten-year-old child have finally paid off.

 (classical music playing)  I did it, I did it, I did it   I killed Bart dead   La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lots   Of blood   I did what could not be done   To Bugs Bunny by Elmer Fudd.

  Fortunately it's after school hours.

 (chuckles) Good-bye! (tires squealing) (whistling) A votre santÃ©! You wouldn't know, but that means "to your health," of which you have none! (laughs) (doorbell ringing) (groans) (theme song playing) (growling) Bart's father! Bart's dog! Where's Bart? I don't know who you're talking about.

 This Bart! Well, I suppose that does look damning, but have you seen this? Ooh! Ah.

 He's cool.

 Let's move on to the next suspect.

 (screams) Well, I'd better check it out.

 (sighs) Not to complain, but your stomach acids are smoothing the dimples off my balls.

 It's time I moved to my post-Bartum phase.

 I've accepted an Associate Professorship at Springfield University.

 (chuckles) (deflated wheezing) (groans) "I should have been a pair of ragged claws, scuttling across the floors of silent seas.

" What do Eliot's ragged claws represent? Yeah, um this Web site says the claws aren't a metaphor, but, like, an insight to a state of mind.

 Crushed it! What Web site? Forward the link.

 Text me.

 Tweet the link.

 Where is it? I didn't think the author of Cats could be insulted further.

 Class dismissed.

 (groaning) Rubbish! Drivel! What is this Game of Thrones they're referencing? I was a fool to think I'd find solace amongst these moronic, Snapchatting, gap-yearing Hello, Bart.

 It seems the only thing that made me happy in my accursed life was killing you.

 Well, if White Zinfandel can make a comeback, so can you.

 Ooh, those bastards know how to party! (chuckles) I feel like a bad New Yorker cartoon.

 (angry shouting) And now, Bart, let's bring the old "spark" back to our special relationship.

 You couldn't kill me if I came in with pneumonia and a knife in my back.

 (groaning) I didn't care for the "thwock" the sledgehammer made.

 No worries, I'll just kill him again.

 That's why I'm the un-killable kid.

 (screams) Still not dead.

 (groans) Psych! (groaning) Ay, caramba! We're both going to be sore tomorrow.

 (laughs)  Accidents will happen, they only hit and run   You used to be a victim, now you're not the only one   Accidents will happen   They only hit and run   I don't want to hear it   'Cause I know what I've done.

  How much power is this thing using?  There's so many fish in the sea   That only rise up in the sweat and smoke of mercury   But they keep you hangin' on   They say you're so young  (Santa's Little Helper barking) What is it, boy? What have you found? (gasps) I knew it was Bob! Even when they tried and executed Jailbird, I knew it was Bob! Reanimate? This animation looks good enough to me.

 Homer, pull the lever! (groans) I've been pulling levers all day.

 Now! Wow, for once, I was sober at Bart's birth.

 Yes, that's right, Officer.

 There are intruders in my basement.

 Have I the right to shoot? Oh, yeah.

 And you can wear blue jeans to a Broadway show.

 Everything's different now.

 (beeps) (groans) Wait, Dad! (grunting, groaning) That's for trying to frame Krusty.

 What about all the times he tried to kill me? Eh.

 As the one who suffered the most, Mom, may I have custody of Bob's body? Normally I'd say no, but you have been showing responsibility with the dog lately.

 So, fine.

 (humming) (cackles) SIDESHOW BOB: "By Sea-Girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown, "till human voices wake us and we drown.

" Any questions? Yes, what are you supposed to be again? A full professor! But the tenure committee is excruciatingly slow.

 (groaning) (squawks) Hmm.

 (humming) Look at that foolish old man! Every day he drops a perfectly good donut into the ocean.

 Let us mock him for his foolish beliefs! Yes! Yes! Let us show disrespect with poorly-dubbed laughter.

 (delayed laughter) Children, go with your grandfather.

 Can't we go with dead Grandfather? He cannot leave.

 He is the spirit of my tea kettle.

 Lucky me.

 (whistling) Grampa, everyone in town thinks you are foolish.

 Who is more foolish-- the fool or the fool who thinks the fool a fool? What the hell does that mean, Grampa-san? For centuries, our family has made a daily offering of a special donut to a slumbering underwater sea creature, so that he does not rise and destroy us all.

 (both laughing) He is foolish! So foolish! (laughs) Doesn't mean you are not special.

 (groans) (humming a tune) (gasps) (gurgling) (shouts) Now I have all eternity to talk to you.

 Oh Now we will no longer have anyone uselessly floating donuts in the ocean.

 They have made our fish fat and ugly.

 Pathetic.

 (roaring) All right, calm down, children.

 Probably just excitement over the cherry blossoms.

 Of course, the cherry blossoms! They're so beautiful, and yet (roaring) (people screaming) I still refuse to admit the old man was right.

 Legitimate difference of opinion.

 Professor, how do we stop him? Fear not! Without the buoyancy of water, it is physically impossible for any creature that large not to collapse under its own weight.

 It's a simple matter of-- gloy! D'oh! Jo! (tires screech) Scared by the monster? What monster? (roaring)  Yellow ribbon 'round  Huh? Aah! (grunts) Aah! (roaring) Why do you have to stomp on our buildings? This land is 98% rural.

 So much farmland you can walk on without hurting your feet.

 (roars) Right, right.

 The city's the only place you can get tuna rolls at 5:00 in the morning.

 Because you do have fishy breath.

 I'm just telling you.

 (roaring) (grunts) Ah, thank you.

 (roars) So, the key to this movie is it's so cheap it's funny.

 Then just think how popular it would be if we spent a fortune remaking it.

 We'll make millions! After spending hundreds of millions! (all clamoring in agreement) We're here live at the premiere of 'Zilla! And this time, the stars have come out at night! Lurleen Lumpkin, Drederick Tatum and my ex-husband, the Grumple.

 (both groaning) As a tie-in to this movie, Krustyburgers will be made from only reptile meat.

 And don't worry, PETA, we only buy the sick ones! (roars) (gasps) (roaring) Buzz Cola! (roaring) We can't stop him.

 We can't! All we can do is avoid him easily! (crying) He's 2,000 miles away moving at two miles a day.

 What do I do? What do I do?! (both roaring) It's a total bomb.

 We only sold one ticket.

 Oh, I didn't buy my ticket for this.

 I just wanted to get a good seat for the next Star Wars.

 Which will stink to high heaven.

 There's only one thing we can do.

 Dump everything at sea and say we lost it for insurance purposes.

 Aw, yeah, that's moviemaking, Steve.

 That's why we all report to you.

 Toss them overboard, then kill the navigator.

 (roaring) (Homerzilla roaring) LISA: I see a Yellow Monarch, a Woodland Skipper.

 I see (both grunting, laughing) You know, we have been hiking for hours and you two haven't spotted a single butterfly.

 I thought we were hunting owls.

 Well, you haven't done that, either! Uh-huh! (Lisa screams) (groaning) (screams) Don't worry, the hole isn't very deep.

 Oh, wait, I'm on a ledge.

 (Milhouse screaming) (thuds) Oh, God, everything is moist and moving! LISA: Bart?! What? I'm going home.

 to my toy chest, to get my barrel of monkeys, to lower them down.

 At least I'm pitching.

 We got to save him! Fine, but you'll follow me with the camera, right? 'Cause the important thing these days is everything must be on film.

 (grunts) Okay, guys.

 My cell phone is somewhere in that pulsing ooze.

 Now each grab one ankle while I dive in! We have to be careful, Milhouse.

 There's no telling what that Stu Bart, what are you doing?! Madam, how do you do? You don't know what that stuff is doing to you! Oh, it's just the same junk Dad brings us home from work.

 To us Simpsons, this green goop is mother's (gasps) Where are my owls? (grunting) Oh, man, am I looking at a nosebleed! (gasps) Somehow, the radioactive explosion gave us the power to move things with our intellect.

 Flowers for the lady? (gasps) (laughs) Bart, what powers did your brain give you? Look, you're talking to the guy that got demoted from the Tadpoles reading group, okay? Do not make me pity fly.

 Dignity restored.

 You know, we can't tell anyone about this.

 There are going to be lab tests and scientists Do we get to wear those paper gowns? BART: Ow! It's a dress that boys can wear.

 Wedgie! This is not a proportional punishment! (grunts) Hmm, somebody misspelled "wiener.

" (gasps) Lisa Simpson! The Musicians Union does not allow this! You know this is an ASCAP household.

 God gave you this power for good, not jazz, and The 'House always wins! I even got my parents back together! Even now I don't feel close to you.

 (groans) Ah, finally I can diaper all my children.

 Yo, hands up.

 (groans) Hmm, Milhouse has gone mad with power.

 Frankly, I thought it wouldn't take this long.

 Everything's coming up Milhouse! Nicely done, Lis.

 I didn't do it.

 Then I want to know who did! But not that badly.

 (giggles, coos) (piano playing "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star") Excuse me, uh, Ou est Le Eiffel Tower? I appreciate that you are trying to learn our language.

 (yawns) Once again we just have a cameo.

 Don't complain or they'll put us in 4x3.

 Aah, they're doing it! No! Just 'cause it looks like season four doesn't make it season four! (Homerzilla roaring)

 HOMER: Pass.

 There comes a time in everyone's life when you need a little extra help getting up from your chair.

 That's why we invented the Seat-to-Feet Lift Chair, which makes getting up by yourself A thing of the past? a thing of the past! Whoo-hoo! (whirring) Wha? He's he's up! (choked up): He's up.

 (gasps, moans) Eleventy-hundred? I can't afford that.

 But that chair would be a lot better than the way I get up now.

 (growling) (grunting) Come on Yeah! (panting) (chattering) Magic Club! Join the Magic Club! Want to cut up a banana without peeling it? Join and (spooky): I'll tell you how.

 It's with a needle and thread! I like magic! I'm going to take one of your cards.

 Or did I take 52? (gasps) Do you want to join? You could be president! Just man the booth.

 I need to go to the bathroom.

 I'd love to join.

 Honestly, this is the only booth that doesn't creep me out.

 Hug me! Hug me! Hug me! I'm Harper.

 Just moved here.

 Trying to make friends.

 Lisa.

 Always been here.

 Trying to make friends.

 (both giggle) Well, I've got news for all of your clubs: it's 3:00 p.

m.

, so Willie's turnin' on the sprinklers! (screaming) HOMER: Guys, I need your advice.

 Season three of anything is the best.

 Agreed.

 But I wanted advice for something else.

 (sighs) It's something I really need for my well-being, but I just don't have the bucks.

 The thing everyone's doing these days, uh, by which I mean a couple of years ago, is to get money through crowdfunding.

 You thought about that? Yes, but what is it? Crowdfunding is when lots of people give you small amounts of money to help your passion project come to life.

 Thanks to crowdfunding, we have Makey Makey computers, the 3Doodler pen, and Zach Braff's generation-defining dud "Wish I Was Here.

" Well, if there's anything that has true wisdom, it's crowds.

 Hmm.

 Hello, friends.

 Are you sick of "Big Charity" asking you for money, with its free return envelopes and annoying black tie dinners? Well, I'm here to ask you for something different.

 Something simple.

 You can help a man get back on his feet.

 Dad, what are you recording? Ooh, Lisa.

 Turn to camera and quickly say "please give.

" Please give.

 Give what? Uh, Lisa eh, well, we'll fix that in post.

 (sobs) He didn't even have the money to fix that in post.

 That is the saddest thing I've ever seen.

 (sobbing) (cash register bell rings) Well, I suppose I could spare a little for my neighboreeno.

 Will you shut up, Flanders?! (chuckles) Lip zipped.

 (cash register bell rings) I don't give handouts to poor people.

 It's not in the spirit of self-made Americanism, as espoused by Russian weirdo Ayn Rand.

 (cash register bell rings) Dang it! We did it, friends.

 Made our goal.

 And now, to reveal the miracle that you all made happen (whirring) That's right.

 You bought me this chair.

 My ass was just lifted by a thousand angels.

 We bought him a chair? That lazy lump! After I finish this beer and have a nap, I may just call him.

 (scoffs) You gave money to this idiot? It was from my separate bank account.

 What separate account? Uh I only use it to pay for my separate phone.

 You have a separate phone? Um um uh MAN: Up, down, up, down.

 Up, down (chair squeaking) up, down.

 Good! You feel the burning in your core? Oh, yes, I do.

 (blowing) (slurps) Mmm.

 (pounding at door) MARGE: Homie, answer the door! For the first time in my life, I'd be happy to! (pounding continues, Homer hums happily) Spend my money on a chair, sir? (indistinct shouting) You're a lazy, bald monster.

 Don't be alarmed, there, Homer.

 We're just gonna calmly and gently destroy that chair! No way.

 My chair is now protected by a human shield.

 (Homer shrieks) MOE: Take that, you idiot! (shouting) (muffled shouting continues in other room) HOMER: Lisa the crowdfunding video you costarred in is causing a lot of problems.

 The what-what I what-whatted in? (crowd shouting angrily) (chanting): Burn that chair! Burn that chair! Burn that chair! Wait a minute.

 That's not the chair.

 What? Oh.

 Oh.

 (flames hissing, siren wailing) No tip! (sorrowful music plays) (humming) (sighs) Guess a guy like me is never gonna get the finer things in life.

 What's the point? Aw, you poor thing.

 I've never seen you this unhappy lying down.

 LISA: Dad? Can you take me to a concert with my new friend Harper? Her dad got us the seats.

 Sure, why not? It'll be nosebleed or obstructed view seats.

 That's all a self-pitying guy like me ever gets.

 Who's the band? They're an adorable Australian boy band, and you can't really understand what they're saying.

 But who cares? I understand.

 That's how I felt about Crocodile Dundee.

 I will never forgive you for making us see that third movie.

   Music in a sports arena.

 The acoustics are gonna be a joke.

 Two tickets for Homer Simpson.

 Here you go and here are your platinum V.

I.

P.

 wristbands.

 What the? V.

I.

P.

? Oh, this is never coming off! Just like the one from the last great day in my life.

 Oh, those muffins.

 And it's all thanks to Harper's dad.

 Who is this guy? Mm.

 (upbeat music playing) Ooh.

 Mi hijo queria ver esto, pero no puedo arrastrarla a mi show.

 Yes, yes, yes.

 (classical music playing) Whoa! The only platinum band I have is the one that's holding my skull together.

 Um, through that door.

 Remember when we were A-list? It all went south for me when I got that D.

U.

I.

 and said all those things I secretly believe.

 Doe-eyed Boys! (screams happily) Where? Where? Maybe one of these four little wimps will tell me.

 Answer me, wimps! That's them.

 The band.

 (squeals) Hi.

 I'm Bindi, and this is Boz, McQuarrie and Wodonga.

 (gasps) Wodonga.

 I'm afraid you don't belong here.

 Your wristbands are platinum with stripes.

 (gasps) You belong in there, braddah! (heavenly music plays) Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, I wish I could tell you guys what's in there, but you know no stripes.

 Lisa! You made it!   Homer Simpson? I'm Harper's dad.

 And I am so stoked to meet you! My entire life has been a journey toward these seats.

 Who are you? ("Sirius" by Alan Parsons Project plays) ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the new owner of the Springfield Arena, the CEO of J-Cloud Digital Storage Solutions Mike Jambowski! (whooping) I love this venue! Ven-ue! Ven-ue! Ven-ue! Venue (whoops) Venue! Hey, you want to fire a confetti gun, Homer? (gasps) That's the only kind of gun I've never fired.

 Come on, just point and squeeze.

 (cheering) I know that guy.

 Yeah, sure you do, Uncle Lenny.

 No, he works at the plant with me.

 Homer something.

  When we harmonize   And you look in our eyes  (female fans scream)  You'll see it's no surprise   That we're your Nobel Prize   'Cause, girl, you know it's true   All four of us love you   Yeah, we do, yeah, we do, yeah, we do   Monday I love you   Tuesday I do, too   Wednesday that's for me   Thursday I love thee   Friday is your day  (sighing) Is this heaven? Not quite, 'cause I hate the music.

 Maybe we're not close enough to the band, huh?  How about we all just  Fantastic! The future of music, man! Wow! Hey, Homer, you want to get out of here, get a beer?  Girl, you know it's true   All four of us love you   Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

  And now a special guest.

 From the Hasbro Channel's hit sitcom Recycle Michael and the Tin Can Crew, inoffensive robot superstar, Der Zip Zorp.

 (scratching records) (crowd cheering) Hi, I'm Gus, and I'll be happy to serve you.

 A friendly bartender? This is like being from North Korea and finding out there's a South Korea.

 Homer, a toast to two single dads doing their best.

 I'm not a single dad.

 Well, this will just be a toast to me, then.

 (shouts) Ooh, whoa, are you okay? Be careful.

 I love you.

 I'm great! (laughs) When I'm happy, I make holes.

 And when I'm sad, I buy a hockey team.

 They cost like nothing, man.

 And I made $80 million today.

 Bam-bam-bam! (laughs) You try.

 Whoo-hoo! Bam! (crackling) (muttering) (Homer groaning) (stammers) Did I make $80 million? No, but you made a fool of the doctor who said you'd die.

 Well, he still might! Not today.

 Wow, Mike's daughter seems really great.

 Yeah, but it was weird.

 First she was nice to me, but then when the band came, she wouldn't let me say a word.

 Uh, listen, sweetie.

 Let me tell you a fact of life.

 The world is full of wonderful, priceless experiences, and I can't give you any of them.

 But this girl can.

 So it doesn't matter if she talks to you, looks at you or is disrespectful to your father.

 She is your best friend.

 Mm, I don't know.

 (phone chimes) Huh, Harper just invited us to go see David Copperfield.

 Oh, my God! That's something only tourists in Vegas get to do! (dog howls) Did you ever sit in the back of anything? Just the space shuttle, man.

 My one regret is I was too drunk to drive.

 (laughs): Oh-oh, oh-oh, bam! Bam on that one.

 Okay, ladies, would each of you tell me your favorite TV show and dessert.

 Certainly, my favorites are The Happy Little Elves Krusty and cotton candy.

 I was gonna say what my Sorry, that's too long without me talking.

 (audience gasps) So what do I do now?! Don't worry.

 Harper? What's your favorite starving wild animal? Crocodile? What's the trick here?! (snarling) I'm so happy.

 Marge, do you know what it's like to have a man take care of your every need? I've thought about it a lot, but no.

 How come you're so quiet? Did he switch your brain with a rabbit's? 'Cause that means somewhere there is one annoying rabbit.

 Shut up.

 I just keep thinking about the way Harper cut me off.

 It's kind of weird.

 Yeah, that was kind of weird.

 I'd have said something for sure, but my mouth was full of truffle popcorn.

 (phone chimes) (gasps) Mike just invited our family to spend next week on their private island! Wow, a whole week.

 Too bad the kids have school.

 Marge, please.

 Lisa's not gonna fall behind and Bart's not gonna catch up.

 We do not want our kids spoiled.

 (groans) Yeah, okay.

 Maybe this is where this thing should stop.

 (phone rings) Hello? This is Principal Seymour Skinner.

 We're calling parents, starting with you, to let them know that school has been canceled next week.

 Hmm, did that rich dad buy you off? (laughs) Seymour Skinner is not for sale.

 The bread is in the oven.

 Lisa, Lisa, wait! I'm so glad you guys are coming with us.

 So I got you a friendship present.

 (hums "ta-da") A new bike? Uh, that's so nice of you.

 Tiffany crystal bell.

 (melodious chime plays) And the latest anti-theft device.

 (robotic voice): You're not Lisa Simpson.

 Okay, what's the story? This we show up for.

 Harper, this bike is wonderful.

 Too wonderful.

 It just wouldn't be right for me to accept it.

 You'd rather have your crappy bike? Look, Harper, this may be crappy, but it's my bike.

 My dad assembled it on Christmas day.

 Which is why I have to pedal backwards to go forwards.

 But still, I love this! Uh, I didn't realize getting you the best bike you ever saw would make you so mad.

 I'm not mad, I just think this is Just what? Don't appreciate what I did for you? Why do you always interrupt me like that? That's not how friends Uh, I think I know how friends are.

 How would you like it if I interrupted you all the time? I could've been friends with anybody-- Janey, Sherri, Terri, You wouldn't like it all, would you? Hubert Wong, Wendy Wang.

 No, you wouldn't.

 Interrupt, interrupt, interrupt, interrupt! That girl with freckles only on one side of her face.

 Could you please, just for once, not interrupt me?! Whoa, sweet bike.

 BOTH: You can have it! Even sweeter.

 As soon as I put some training wheels on this, I'll be the coolest kid ever.

 Oh! Too fast! (deep breaths) You can put that stuff away, 'cause the trip is off.

 Well, where are we going with Harper? Nowhere, 'cause we're not friends anymore.

 (muffled): D'oh!   You owe me a Caribbean vacation, Lisa! St.

 Croix or better.

 Lisa, sweetie, I just want to understand.

 You got in a fight with her because she tried to give you a new bike?! But she was so condescending! Yeah, she was "kinda sending" you a new bike.

 Can you all please get out of my room?   MIKE: Let's not let our little girls' not liking each other stand in the way of their being friends.

 Come to the island, man.

 We have everything there, except for trunks your size-- ha! You still want us to come? Oh, kids fight all the time.

 They're not in control of themselves like we are.

 Damn, that is a beautiful sunset! Damn! Damn! Aah! Whew, now we'll meet you on the island and the only problem will be the sand in our whatevers.

 Sweetie, we really appreciate this.

 And your brother, well, he's Where is your brother? BART: Hey, a whale.

 Oh, it's Homer.

 (laughing) (dolphins chattering) Oh, I'll show you! Hey, sharks, here's some chum! (screams) (chuckles) Welcome to Jambowski Island.

 Formerly Haiti.

 I'm really glad you came, Lisa.

 Thanks for having us.

 Now, Homer, I got you a special surprise.

 HOMER: A beach lift chair! The laziest thing there is.

 Aw.

 (calypso music playing) (moans happily)   HOMER: Suckers! (James Bond theme song playing)  Underneath the mango tree   Me honey and me can watch for the moon   Underneath the mango tree   Me honey and me make boolooloop soon.

  Harper flipped a sea turtle on its back! My beach, my turtle! Why is everything yours?! Oh, why do you kids have to argue all the time? 'Cause she wants things her way instead of the right way.

 Homer, help me out here.

 No, no, with the girls.

 Just tell your kid to let my kid have her way this time.

 And every other time.

 (crying): Dad I think you have a choice to make here.

 (sighs) It's time I stood up for myself.

 (whirring) Harper, I know I shouldn't say this on your private island, but you're kind of spoiled.

 (both gasp) That's right.

 You don't deserve Lisa.

 There's nothing I love more than her.

 She's the sun, the moon and the other thing to me.

 (gasps) Thank you.

 And we don't have to be on the same island with people who push my little girl around.

 Let's go, Marge.

 Now? I just got up.

 Now, please! If you leave this island, you're not taking the yacht.

 Oh, no.

 You're taking a limo to the private jet, which is flying you straight home.

 Then so be it.

 Hmph.

 (quiet sigh) (grunting) I know how you feel, buddy.

 Oh, I better sit down.

 Where can I sit? Dad, what you said was really nice.

 And believe me, we're much better off, off that island.

 I know.

 Good-bye, crystal-clear lagoon.

 Good riddance, pink sand beach.

 Good-bye, swim-up movie theater that was going to show Back to the Future.

 Good-bye, sweet liquors that didn't let Marge know I was drunk.

 Good-bye, snorkeling and Jet-Skiing and other things I never tried.

 Good-bye, obese natives that made me feel fit.

 Good-bye, Bart.

 Bart?! (laughing) Shh!   


                





                    			 D'oh! (tires screeching) (grunts)   HOMER: D'oh!    Tonight, tonight   I'll win at cards tonight   My flushes will be   Straight tonight   Lenny's gonna dominate tonight   Carl's gonna be a little late tonight   Tonight, tonight   I'll cheat them all tonight   When they're drunk   They don't play cards quite right   Tonight, tonight   I won't get drunk tonight   Without a beer, my head will clear   Tonight   It's fun to trick a rummy   To put liquor in his tummy   Your friendship's a delight   And you may lose your sight  ALL:  Tonight  (burps)  Tonight, tonight   Band camp calls tonight   My demo goes online   Tonight     Tonight, tonight   My dreams come true tonight   Deposit's due tonight   I'll take the pot tonight   I'll eat fondue tonight   I'll spike your brew tonight  ALL:  Tonight!  Moe, what the hell is that?! Sorry.

 I missed rehearsal.

 Damn it.

 Marge, I'm heading out! Poker night! I don't want you losing all our scrimpings! Don't worry, Marge.

 The real excitement for me is staying within a budget.

 (snickers) This is just a friendly game, right? Oh, super friendly.

 Suckers.

 Dad, Dad, Dad.

 I need two things: a good-night hug and a favor.

 Mm.

 To save time, I'll start describing the favor.

 I've just been accepted to the best band camp this side of the Mississippi! Which side are we again? Doesn't matter! It's a great camp.

 Notable graduates include Pete Barbutti.

 Pete Barbutti?! Yes! Anyway, it's a little pricey.

 So, if you win big tonight, maybe you could help make a little girl really happy.

 Don't worry, sweetie, I'm gonna win.

 And you know why? I'm wearing my lucky T-shirt.

 (sighs) It was such a shame he lost to President Garfield.

 Oh, I'll fix this.

 There.

 (hums a tune) The maestro is here.

 (screams, crashes) Hey, who's the lady? What, are you kidding? This is Laney Fontaine, Broadway legend.

 She starred opposite Al Pacino in Does a Tiger Wear A Necktie? Ooh! Now I date Moe.

 He's got everything I look for in a man: a current liquor license.

 (chuckles) Well, it and you are the two most precious wrinkled yellow things I know.

   WOMAN (over headphones): Three of a kind beats two pair.

 Straight beats three of a kind.

 Three beats two.

 Four beats three.

 HOMER: Oh, my God.

 Full house.

 We're gonna win! That means Lisa goes to band camp.

 As long as Homer doesn't let them know how good his hand is.

 Then he'll blow the whole damn thing to hell! That would be terrible.

 Worst jammed-in movie parody ever.

 Come on, Homer.

 Poker face.

 Aah! Stupid git! I raise, no calls, pot goes to me.

 Hold on, Fat Folds Five.

 (stammers) I see your raise, and I raise this.

 Is that real? Won it for cinematography.

 Invented a new kind of Steadicam that's mounted on a dog.

 That's five grand to you.

 So, are you in, or are you (groans) While I'm out, no one look at my cards or my boobs.

 (groans) Aw.

 Don't she black out like an angel? Queens beat jacks.

 No one heard that.

 I'm in.

 (hums a tune) Okay, Homer.

 Moment of truth.

 Oh, four of a kind! Hey, honey, you won! Huh? I lost.

 I lost everything.

 We're gonna celebrate, Moe.

 What's Springfield's version of Sardi's? Uh, Hardee's.

 I know a nice booth under a picture of a hamburger.

 Aw, come on, Homer.

 I'll drive you home.

 (imitates engine revving) Hey, off we go! Vroom, vroom, vroom.

 (imitates engine chugging) (door closes) WOMAN: You've completed Poker: A Beginner's Guide.

 Now go out there and win.

 I bid two bucks.

 (floor creaking softly) (belt cracks) (gasps) What was that? Those aren't the tiptoes of a successful gambler.

 How much did you lose? $5,000.

 (high-pitched chirping) Whoa, I never heard that noise.

 (sobbing) (Marge continues sobbing) I'm just sayin', doesn't look like band camp is in the cards.

 (playing jazz music) Hey, this is my thing now.

 So easy.

 Guys, I help with a plan.

 Hey, what about a reverse mortgage? I saw a commercial for one where an old lady gave a thumbs-up and it turned into money, which filled up the screen.

 The entire screen? Swear to God.

 Hey, Homer, here's a thought: invite Laney over for dinner.

 Show her your crummy home, your unhappy kids.

 Anyone with a heart would take pity.

 Finally, my sucky life pays off.

 Do you guys think she'll buy it? Oh, yeah.

 Your whole house, uh, it smells like a basement.

 I've always hated your rugs.

 Yeah Whoa, whoa, whoa.

 Why you have to go there, man? He has such beautiful floors.

 Why must he hide them? Why? LANEY: There I am, on the main stage at Caesar's, about to sing "Do You Love Me," when who do I see sitting in the wings? Your boyfriend King Tut? No.

 Jack Jones.

 High on his success from "Wives and Lovers" with eyes for yours truly.

 But you'd just accepted a proposal from Mike Connors.

 Which I broke off.

 Let's just say Mannix was the one man I had to nix.

 (laughs): Oh! Oh, that's rich! Oh, my God.

 That's going in your book.

 Please tell me you're writing a book.

 (choking) (grunts) Sit down, boy.

 We're trying to show this dame that we're deserving of her pity.

 Where's that crutch I gave you? There's nothing wrong with my leg.

 There will be.

 D'oh! Ow! Ow, my leg! (sobbing): Oh! Oh, my leg.

 Oh! Who would take $5,000 from such a miserable creature? (sobbing) Laney, I know it's your night off, but would you like to sing a song for us? You don't have to ask me twice.

  I'm just a Broadway lady   Dancing on my aching feet   Avoiding any foods with wheat   And no drinking pre-show  It's okay if the producer don't  Know.

  (playing jazz music) Wow.

 You know your way around a horn, kid.

 Oh, listen, I don't want to gush, but I have all your albums.

 Laney Sings The Blues, Electric Laney Land, Laney Butchers The Beatles.

 Ooh, and my favorite, Rehab Yourself A Merry Little Christmas.

 I'll tell you what, Marge.

 I'll wipe the slate clean on one condition.

 I want you to give Lisa to me.

 (grumbles) Uh, for a month or so.

 I see.

 Get out.

 I never want to see you again.

 Let me explain.

 Listen, lady, you can't take a daughter from a mother unless you're a bigger star and this is a third-world country.

 Marge, I know this sounds nuts, but I never had the joy you have.

 A child to hug me at the end of the day or-or a chance to pass along what I know.

 I'm going out on tour, and she's got all the makings of a star: talent, smarts and a star-shaped head.

 Perhaps you didn't hear me.

 Here's your coat.

 Mom, Mom.

 Mom, please.

 You were gonna let me go to band camp for a month, where people break curfew and exchange reeds.

 But this? This is the opportunity to live my dream.

 Come on, how many chances in life do you get for that? GRAMPA: None! I've been here, I've just been quiet.

   (sighs) I guess I can't deny you this.

 All right.

 (gasps) Oh, thanks, Mom! And, Mom, if you have any doubts how a showbiz kid will turn out, just look at all of them! (groans) (tires screech) Mom, I appreciate this so much.

 You'll be the first person I thank at the Tonys after the great Angela Lansbury.

 Bye.

 (smoke hisses) (tires screech) (tires screech) Good night, kid.

 Would you read to me before I go to bed? Anne of Green Gables? I did the audiobook on this.

 If chapter ten sounds like it was Peter Falk, it's because it was.

 So I guess you don't want to read it again.

 How 'bout I give you some showbiz advice? Every piece of advice someone gives you will turn out to be wrong.

 Particularly wrong are people like me who seem knowledgeable.

 Aw, she's already out.

 (phone rings) MOE: You watching Channel Six right now? Hurry up! Hurry up! Aw! Nah, too late.

 The cops cleaned it up.

 (piano playing) Chazz Busby.

 My director.

 The man who's ruined more productions than flu season.

 Laney! My star, my muse, my God, what have you done to your face? (Laney and Chazz laugh) Who's the lampshade? This is Lisa Simpson, the sax prodigy who's gonna blow life into my act.

 Show him, kid.

 (plays three notes) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I wanted an audition, not a recital.

 You're in, kid.

 I made it in Hartford.

 MARGE: Are you sure you set it up right? Yes! Then why aren't we Skyping? I don't know.

 Maybe Lisa's drugged-out.

 My daughter is not drugged-out.

 Maybe she's just sleeping late after partying at discotheques.

 How do you know about all-night discotheques? We have Disco Stu in this town, Mom.

 He's a resource.

 Use him.

 (Skype ringtone plays) How are you, sweetie? (gravelly): I'm good, I'm good.

 What happened to your voice? I don't know.

 Late rehearsals, cheap root beer.

 (coughing) (normal voice): But I'm great! We're heading to New York! (blows) Who's watching you? Sonny and Stix.

 (playing jazz music) Do I hear syncopation? Lisa, Lisa, I was thinking maybe you could come home a little early and I'm sorry.

 I got to go.

 Our take five is over, and jazz is all about following the rules, you know.

 Come on, guys.

 Don't I get a puff? (gasps) I really have the munchies.

 (crunching) Bye! We've got to get her back.

 Pack your things.

 We're heading for New York.

 We should get a place there.

 We go so often.

 I can't believe I'm gonna be performing here.

 (dramatic music playing) I already got my ticket! LISA (nervously): Ah, so many seats.

 (car sputtering) Damn it! Lousy electric car.

 Dad, just 'cause it got hit by lightning that time doesn't make it electric.

 Shut up, boy.

 How may I help thee, friends? Our car broketh down.

 (gasps) Springfield Englisher accent? You must know my ultra-liberal cousin Ned Flanders.

 Oh, he's brought such shame to our family with his lip hair and two marriages.

 And do you know he's left-handed? (wheels creaking) Um, can I please use the, uh, little bearded boys' room? (horse neighs)   (humming) How deep did thou diggest? With God's grace, it will be enough.

  Don't know why   There's no sun up   In the   In the in the  How about "in the sky"?! The sky! You ought to know, sweetheart.

 You were there when God created it.

 Eh, go shave a coconut.

 (gasping) I turned down Transformers on Broadway for this? I was a Megatron-sized fool! Kristen Chenoweth was set to play Sam Witwicky's mother.

 This is how mad I am! Fade to black! You can't be serious! I said fade! Everyone, meet me back here in however long it takes to wake up from five Valium.

 On the dot! (horns honking) Hey, man, how'd you get that seat? They thought I was pregnant.

 (indistinct chatter) It's showtime, Laney.

 Time to see if there's still a spark left in that smoldering Duraflame log you call a career.

 Hey, Laney.

 Moe, I need you.

 To make me feel confident, strong and beautiful.

 Boy, I'm not real good at boosting self-esteem there.

 But, uh, if you make a mistake, I can fire my gun.

 And that's what the critics will be yappin' about tomorrow.

 (chuckles) That's not encouragement! Those are your lyrics! (applause, piano playing)  I had a dream   A dream about you, baby   It's gonna come true, baby   They think that we're through   But, baby   You'll be swell   You'll be great   Gonna have the whole world on a   On a  Plate! (crowd cheering) Cheering for someone getting a word right.

 That is a low bar.

 (panting) Four tickets, please.

 I'm sorry, ma'am.

 The show is sold out for reasons that elude me.

 My daughter's in there.

 Eh, we all got our problems.

 I'm a ticket seller for a dying art form.

 Hey, uh, you're a union man, right? Brother? Why didn't you say so? I have no choice now but to be corrupt.

 In you go.

 LANEY:  Everything's gonna be   Bright lights and lollipops  (playing jazz solo) (crowd cheering) Come on, let's sneak her out.

 Under the guise of soliciting for Broadway Cares.

 (coins jingling) Wait.

 Wait, Homer.

 Look at our little girl.

 She's got chops.

 Honest-to-goodness chops.

 Yeah.

 Letting our daughter go on the road with an 80-year-old diva and some sketchy jazz guys was the best decision we ever made.

  Everything's coming up roses   For me and for you!  (crowd cheering) (whoops) Mom, that was the greatest night of my life! MILHOUSE: Hey! When does the show start? It did, and it was wonderful.

 Eh, she's been bitten by the showbiz bug.

 And when that happens, only working with Bruce Willis can extinguish it.

 (giggles) (sighs) Okay.

 Just finish out the tour.

 We'll see you in Pittsfield.

 No way! Pittsfield ain't happening for this little scene stealer.

 I love you, Lisa, but you got a bigger ovation than me.

 So we can never share the same stage again.

 What? How can you say that? Showbiz lesson number seven: just when things are going great, they pull the rug out from under you.

 Bad news, Laney.

 We're shutting down.

 Never cleared the rights to "Everything's Coming Up Roses.

" See what I mean? Also, we're gonna need that rug.

 (grunts) (shouts) (sniffles) Mom, suddenly I really want to go home.

 Oh.

 Mm.

 If you go, let me give you one huge piece of advice: take the Eighth Avenue side, then catch a cab and circle back.

 And away I go! (scatting) Pow! Well, Laney, youse, uh you still got me.

     See how gaudy his house is? A brass doorknocker? Who lives here, Caligula? 'Tis troubling.

 Cousin Jacob! All the way from Pennsyl-diddly-vania! I see thou art still using the Devil's "diddly.

" Well, I must confess, I-I do over-diddly.

 And I see your house is lit by Edison's witch lights.

 (chuckles) Who's holier than thou now, Ned? Homer, you've shown me that I'm guilty of the sin of pride, and that just makes me love you more.

 Oh, God, I'm stuck in a Flandwich.

 With side orders of love and forgiveness! D'oh! Shh!   


                





                    			 HOMER: D'oh!   (clears throat) Yes, uh, the students of Springfield Elementary have each created an alternative energy vehicle.

 One of which will ensure the future of humanity as determined by a short race across the parking lot.

 (mumbles): Yeah, yeah.

 And now, uh, what is your car powered by, uh, fat little boy? Hydrogen-powered fuel cells.

 Ah, hydrogen-- yeah, yes, wonderful.

 My car is powered by the wind! Oh, how it blows.

 Mine is potato-powered.

 I keep tell you I'm not a potato.

 Be quiet, hash browns! Dad, I'm so excited! I think-- Hey, please don't stand so close.

 In the world of solar power, shadows are the arch-enemy.

 I think I might win.

 I believe in you and that's a given.

 But I don't know.

 That kid's car has flames painted on the side of it.

 Why would he do it if it wasn't fast? Children, start your engines! They're not engines! That's the whole point of this thing! Yeah just go.

 (crowd cheering) That never works.

 Yahoo! I'm sun-made racin'! Duff Beer, the only way to get fathers through kids' events.

 Huh? What? No! That shouldn't happen! I should have stored energy! You skimped on the cadmium in your batteries, just like a girl.

 Stick to the liberal arts, honey.

 Uh, have fun going to Oberlin! (laughs) Maybe you can transfer after a couple years to Bates! (laughing) Enjoy Maine in the winter! Hope you like Division III basketball! (boys laughing) (crying) Now, don't you worry, kid.

 They also laughed at Amelia Vanderbuckle.

 (sniffling) Amelia Vanderbuckle? Who's she? Ah, she was Springfield's original lady inventor.

 Ah! Why have I never heard of her? Well, totally nuts.

 She made a mess of everything.

 Oh! Easy, girly, don't go Vanderbuckle on us.

 (grunting) "Amelia Vanderbuckle lived in Springfield "in the 1800s.

 "She was the middle child of a family of 17.

 "12 of whom died from exposure to drafty windows.

 Her father worked as a human canary in the poison mines.

" "Amelia was the first female graduate of Springfield Tech.

" Do you have to read out loud? I'm trying to pour ants in this doll.

 (louder): "Among other things, she was the proud inventor of the steam-powered barber chair.

" (jaunty, tinny piano music playing) (both scream) I want one! "A medical board diagnosed Amelia "with acute feminine overreachism and she was-- (gasps) "She was committed to the Springfield Home for the Criminally Different.

" Whoa, the banana cabana? "But Amelia never gave up, "continuing to work as an inventor within the confines of the asylum.

" BART: Ay, carumba! Bart, if we find those inventions, we can prove that Amelia was scientifically significant.

 Pass.

 Listen to me.

 I need to prove this woman was not a lunatic so people will not giggle when they hear the words "woman scientist.

" (chuckles) "Woman scientist.

" What's next-- boy cigarette girl? (Grampa laughs in distance) Let me ask again.

 Will you help me break into an abandoned insane asylum? (wind gusting, whistling) Abandoned asylum, where have you been all my life? How do we get in? Well, I'd say the best bet is the sewer pipe.

 Oh, gee.

 (echoing): Oh, come on, Bart.

 Or this door.

 Bart! (laughs) (moaning nearby) The ghosts of a thousand lunatics are making me hot.

 Yeah, what doesn't make you hot? Alcoholic stepfathers.

 (goofy grunting and snorting) Ew! Stop that! You don't know who had that in their mouth.

 Sure I do-- some luno! Mmm, that's good crazy.

 Ew.

 "Vanderbean, Vanderbottom, Vanderbozo--" ah, here we go-- "Vanderbuckle! "Vanderbuckle, Alfred; Vanderbuckle, Alice; "Vanderbuckle, Allspice; Vanderbuckle, Amelia"! A wax cylinder! Amelia recorded her voice! (nonchalant): Mm.

 AMELIA: Though I have been locked up in this sanitarium for lo, these many years, I have completed an invention that will change the world! Bart! Did you hear that? (imitating Dracula): Good evening.

 Because I am not taken seriously due to my gender, a friendly guard has hidden my invention until a future time, when some liberated young woman has the permission of her husband to look for it.

 There's a whole closet of these things! How many magicians do they have in this place? Find my journal, and it will lead you to my greatest invention! P.

S.

 Nikola Tesla might have told you he broke up with me, but I broke up with him.

 Aah! We've got to find that journal.

 Ooh! "Dear Diary, today I watched a neighbor's house burn down.

 This will teach their dog to laugh at me.

" Whoa! Look at me! I'm enjoying reading! Guys, did you ever read something and think it was written just for you? Behold the diary of Nathan Little! "I pushed a vagabond under a trolley.

" What's a trolley? Old-timey subway.

 What's a vagabond? Homeless guy.

 (sobbing, wailing) What's a homeless guy? Ralphie! Come on, we got daddy-son tap class! Tap class! Hey, where is that kid? We got a recital next week and his timestep is terrible, let alone flair.

 Tap class! Tuh tap class? (boys scream) Ralphie, what is going on here? Bart made us read pages from a scary diary.

 I was so a-scared, sour juice came out my front tail.

 Bart wrote this? This is bad.

 Ooh, really bad.

 I don't think we're gonna make it to tap class.

 (knocking on door) Chief Wiggum? Your son is dead (loud gasp) inside.

 (quieter gasp) That's bad, too.

 Yeah, these are pages from your son's diary.

 I'm afraid they very clearly show him to be a sociopath.

 Hm.

 Well, I've never seen Bart write in cursive, so I'm a little proud of that, but this is the worst thing that's ever happened to this family.

 I-I'm sorry, Marge.

 And shuffle off, shuffle off, shuffle off.

 (Homer humming cheerfully) Homie, I've learned something terrible about Bart.

 You may want to have a drink.

 Way ahead of ya.

 Chief Wiggum found these pages from our son's diary! Oh, I've had a long day.

 Bart might be a sociopath.

 Socio-what? (groans) "Someone who can't feel empathy or guilt.

 They do terrible things and don't care who it hurts.

" (doorbell chiming repeatedly) Don't answer that! It could be Bart! Bart has a key.

 What?! Who gave him a key! Hey, Mrs.

 Simpson.

 Can Bart come over and see my grandfather's collection of Japanese swords and throwing daggers? Aah! Why don't you play with Lisa instead, hmm? (grunts) Konnichi-whaaa?! Hey, Milhouse.

 Wow, this is a surprise.

 I'm usually sweating when we talk, but not this time.

 It's amazing how you can charm  and disgust me at the same time.

 That's just what happens when I'm with the prettiest girl in town.

 Aw (cackles, snorts) Ew.

 Amelia's journal tells us that her invention is buried in the basement of the Springfield Suffragette Society.

 (sighs): Ah anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're sleuthing? Milhouse, did the Hardy Boys ever hit on Nancy Drew? Frank did, but Joe let's just say there's a mystery about him.

 The Suffragette Society was right here.

 Oh here? Hey, sweetie, you looking for your mom? I'll find her-- just, uh, give me her cup size.

 Actually, we're here because your basement is home to a landmark of feminist history.

 Do you mind if we poke around? The basement, eh? Yeah, that's where we wash the ketchup off the old onion rings.

 So no.

 These guys want a children's menu? Nah, they're just leavin'.

 Seriously, kids, I got to switch ten TV's over to the fourth round of the NBA draft, so get lost.

 All right, Denver Nuggets on the clock, people! Okay, I found a test online that will tell us, once and for all, whether Bart is a you know.

 HOMER: Wait a minute! We can't just give Bart something labeled "Sociopath Test"! He might look it up and set us on fire with his mind! You're right! We need Bart to think the test is for something else.

 Finally! A use for the label maker! One of you betrayed me, and snitches lose their stitches.

 (high-pitched): Sit on my banana! (normal voice): Why, you little! (grunting) Where does he get this stuff? Hey, son, your mom and I just found this quiz you'd really love to take.

 "Are You a Jet Ski Dude or a Motocross Maestro?" Remember to answer the questions honestly.

 We want to know if you meet the clinical definition of "jet ski dude.

" "I enjoy manipulating other people.

" "I believe I'm being followed.

" "Sometimes I feel as if I must injure myself or someone else.

" Agree, agree, agree.

 Hmm.

 "Sociopath.

" What's that? Ay, carumba! That's what they think I am? Fine! I'll pretend to be the biggest sociopath in the world! And I only need to change three answers.

 Is he nuts? I don't know.

 What do you think? I mean, he looks nuts, that's for sure.

 (clears throat) So, here's your test.

 Call me crazy, but I enjoyed it.

 (Bart whistling "Pop Goes the Weasel") Well, the good news is that Bart just got his first 100% ever on a test.

 Oh, my God.

 What do we do? Whatever Bart wants.

 (snickers)  Crazy   But that's how it goes   Millions of people   Living as foes   Maybe   It's not too late  (tires screeching)  To learn how to love   And forget how to hate   Mental wounds not healing   Life's a bitter shame   I'm going off the rails   On a crazy train   I'm going off the rails on a crazy train!  Thanks.

 (male voice, Scottish accent): My pleasure.

 Anything to take down Knockers.

 I've always hated them, because they wouldn't open up at 4:00 a.

m.

 to show the World Caber Tossing Championships.

 Okay, Willie, you can only use the jackhammer when there's lots of noise upstairs.

 No worries.

 It is Monday Night Football, by which I mean American football, by which I mean no football at all! (muffled cheering and applause) (jackhammering) (gasps) There's the box! (muffled cheering and applause) Ow! Medium spicy! Ach! We've hit the hot sauce supply line! I'll have to neutralize it with some signature blue cheese! Ah! Look at me! I'm a sociopath! Marge, it's time we did something.

 We can take him swimming.

 That makes him sleepy.

 Not good enough.

 We have to call the number at the bottom of the test.

 What number? HOMER: Right there.

 MARGE: "New Beginnings"? We're gonna trust our son to an 800 number? It's 888.

 Marge, this is for his own good.

 He failed an online test.

 How much more proof do you need? Cue-abunga! (bird squawks, Bart laughs) Surprise! Surprise! Whoa, cool! But wait a minute, my birthday's not for another two months.

 We know! But we wanted to have your party now! They were having a sale on piÃ±atas and one thing led to another so we, you know, had a thing, mumble, mumble, mumble mumble Well, where are my friends? Well, I was gonna mail out invites, but I was out of stamps and the post office line was long, (mumbling): and I didn't know where all the little Well, more cake for me.

 No, no, no, no.

 Do the Moon Bounce first.

 Yes! The Moon Bounce! Don't want you throwing up this delicious cake.

 (clunking) (grunting, laughing) (laughing) Huh.

 Eh.

 (laughing) (engine revs, tires squeal) BART: Whoa! (Bart laughing) Wait a minute.

 What is this? Is it an asylum? No, it's a pizza parlor.

 Please tell me, Dad, is it really a pizza parlor? No, son-- the pizza parlor is where your mom and I are going afterwards.

 Now, you're gonna be fine.

 I wouldn't be surprised if you were the least messed-up kid in the whole joint.

 We love you! (doors squeak and clang) Wait, wait, wait! I didn't even get to say good-bye.

 Good-bye! I'll never forgive you! There.

 You happy? Let me out! I was just playing a joke! A cruel joke on the people that love me! That I don't regret! That doesn't make me a sociopath! (door creaks open) WOMAN: Children, form a line in order of medication from Adderall to Zoloft.

 You have been brought here for a purpose.

 You are fearless, and no one can stop you.

 Which means you'll be of great use To the U.

S.

 military.

 I expected more of a reaction.

 I waited outside the door and everything.

 They don't react.

 That's what we want.

 Right.

 We'll be using you in the ultimate video game to test these U.

S.

 Air Force drone simulators.

 Man, that is a tough crowd.

 HOMER: Oh! Mom, Dad, I've discovered the most amazing thing! I can't wait Um, where's Bart? He's safe.

 And more importantly, we're safe.

 (sobs) I miss him so much.

 (panting) Oh.

 Can I call him? You can call his guard, Tico.

 He picks up sometimes.

 I see.

 Okay, I'll do that.

 Homie, where did we go wrong? I don't know, sweetie.

 I don't know.

 We did everything we could for him during the commercials.

 And we're live as Lisa Simpson prepares to prove that Springfield embarrassment Amelia Vanderbuckle deserves to be in the female scientific pantheon, along with Marie Curie and, uh, you know, uh, um, Velma from Scooby-Doo.

 Thank you all for coming out to support a woman's place in history! That's what this is? I thought it was a Green Bay Packers rally.

 All right, you know what, this ain't coming off.

 Behold, the masterpiece of Amelia Vanderbuckle.

 (crowd murmurs) A loom?! That isn't science.

 That's home economics.

 Everyone, storm the stage! (crowd clamoring) Not so fast! This is no ordinary loom! Even an extraordinary loom is the most boring thing I could think of.

 This is much, much more than just a loom.

 (clacking) (squeaking, clicking; Lisa grunts) (whirring, clanking) (puffing) (crowd gasping in wonder) It's alive! And polite! "Operand"? Looks like it wants us to give it a math problem.

 (grunting) (whirring, thudding) Oh, my God.

 Oh, God! It's the first computational device! People, people, don't you see? The board acts like punch cards and the loom like a computer, with the Charles Babbage and the John Von Neumann Let's have the square root of nine cheers for Lisa! (whirring, clanking) ALL: Lisa! Lisa! Lisa! You see that, Bart? You see what your sister did? Yeah, yeah, great.

 Listen, I'm in a simulator, so I can't really talk.

 And you know I'm a sociopath, so I'm just going through the motions here.

 I love you.

 I was just saying that to myself.

 (beep) Kaboom! Blam-blam-blam! Have a smart bomb, stupid.

 (imitates explosions) Nice not knowin' ya.

 MALE ELECTRONIC VOICE: All targets destroyed.

 Simulation complete.

 You are impressive.

 Even though I'm the only real person in the world, and, therefore, I created you in my imagination.

 Children, your empty souls and flying fingers are very impressive, and I can tell you now that was no simulation.

 You mean we were blowing up real stuff? That's right-- convoys, terrorist training camps, suspicious weddings, Kabul Starbucks.

 Cool! Awesome.

 - I knew it! (voice breaking): No, I thought it was a video game.

 I don't want to hurt real people.

 Oh, I want to go home.

 Please? How disappointing.

 Does anyone else share the human boy's feelings? Son, the truth is the simulators we told you weren't simulators were simulators.

 (all gasping) Now, I'm sorry, Bart, but you are a healthy, normal boy.

 We're sending you home.

 Really? Oh, wow.

 Dudes, it's been real.

 Although, actually, it was all a fake.

 I'll never forget you, Bart Simpson.

 Dog door in the back that has no lock.

 (knocking on door) My little guy is back! And I'm not bad! I just made bad decisions.

 (crying): It's okay, boy.

 You started out life as a bad decision.

 The best bad decision I ever made.

 (all crying) (crying): And I restored the reputation of a scientist from 100 years ago.

 (crying): And Maggie tried strawberries for the first time.

 What a day! What a day! (sucking pacifier) Okay, Lisa, go ahead and say it.

 Don't be ashamed.

 I'm immortal! (echoing): immortal! Hey, Madam Docent, want to come see? DOCENT: Oh, I'd love to, but there's a huge crowd here at the Science of Thor exhibit.

 Hey, tour! Want to see a great invention and its plaque? We're just passing through to the cafe.

 Double-time, tour.

 How 'bout you, sir? Je Ne parle pas l'Anglais.

 Pas de problÃ¨me.

 Je parle franÃ§ais! Uh, leave me alone, little girl! Okay, pal, if you are indeed a personal computer Oh, baby.

 Spin that yarn.

 Now, that is a loom with a view.

 MARGE: Homie! Come help me carry the groceries! (shouts) Yeah! Clear history, clear history.

 Just working on your anniversary present.

 I know this looks like nothing, but it's actually bad.

   Shh!   


                





                    			 (bells jingling) Ho, ho, ho! D'oh! (tires screeching) (grunts) Oh, are we gonna stay Roto-Rootered like this the whole show? It's rotoscoped, Dad.

 Whatever it is, it's making me sick.

 A noble experiment that failed.

 (acoustic guitar playing) BART: Why is the sky blue? Hmm I don't know.

 Just is.

 - Why are clouds white? - No clue.

 Why are people yellow? It's the way God made them.

 Why is grass green? So you can find your damn golf ball.

 Now I have a question for you.

 Why did you leave your toy car on the stairs? Why is blood red? Why do you ask? - It's coming out your ear.

 - D'oh! So you'll be staying with Grampa while your father is on the mend.

 Don't let him near me! (grunts) Ah! (sobbing): Ow! (cackles) (chuckles) Do it again, boy.

 I bet he can't control it.

 (grunts) Ow! - Aah! - Ow (Grampa and Bart chuckle) Bart, you shouldn't (stifles a chuckle) Maybe one more.

 (grunts) HOMER (screaming): Aah! Ow! (all laughing) (humming) Want to play cars? Oh, boy, if I go down there, I ain't coming up.

 My dad won't play cars with me, either.

 Calm down, Melvin Q.

 Mopenheimer.

 There's other ways of playing cars.

 Feast your eyes on the most beautiful machine ever made: the 1954 Studebaker Starliner Commander! I bought it brand-new and forgot about it till today.

 (impressed whistle) Can I sit in it? Well, I don't know how you expect to drive it if you ain't sitting in it.

 Grampa! I can't drive.

 Neither can I, legally.

 Now let's get going!   You know you can season these things with pepper spray, don't you? Aah! Aah! I need water in my eyes.

 (screams) (laughs) Let's open her up a little.

 (Grampa grunts) (laughing) Homer never showed such spirit.

 You got gumption, boy.

 I wish this day would never end.

 Aw, sorry, Bart.

 Time don't stop.

 The years go by and you don't even realize it.

   Grampa, I told you to get him home by 5:00.

 His tutor's here to teach him to read.

 (sputtering angrily) When I was a boy, I ain't never did not need no tutor either no how! Yes, sirree, ain't! "S-See the m-m-mou m-m-m" "See the mouse.

 "Mouse hits cat.

 Cat goes splat.

" FRINK: Very good, Lisa.

 Very, very good! And with barely any knowledge of diphthongs, sibilants and phonemes.

 (giggling) How come she can read and I can't? All right, calm down, young man.

 Not to worry, you won't need to read.

 You see, customers will just point to a picture of the burger that they want you to flip.

 (exclaims) Because you're not gonna have anything going.

 Very nice painting, Lisa.

 We're putting it right over the couch.

 I made a drawing, too! It's on the refrigerator! And the wall.

 And the curtains.

 (horrified gasp) (gasping, sputtering) Boy, you've ruined our kitchen! Do you understand? This is a place of pork chops.

 But do you like my drawing? Homer, please, please.

 Just say something positive.

 Well, it's a colorful example of something that ruined our kitchen! I can't even find the fridge! You're not beer.

 Where is it? And who are you? We're playing hide and seek.

 I'm Milhouse.

 Milhouse? What kind of a wiener name is that? A very bad one, sir.

 (bell chimes) (humming) That boy is so much trouble.

 Never should have had a firstborn.

 Should've skipped right to the second.

 There's one thing I can do better than you.

 (chuckles) I've finished painting the wall and it's better than new.

 In some ways, this was kind of a bless Ha! I got gumption! (giggles) Bart's disruptive behavior is probably caused by his feeling that you think other children are more deserving of attention.

 Mm, I see.

 And how can we help these other children? We're here for Bart.

 - In a boy like Bart - Yeah? the attention he craves most is from his father.

 Pfft.

 Good luck with that.

 Take him camping! I do want to help him, I do.

 And your son is just looking for your love.

 Geez.

 For a psychologist, you sure know how to get into people's heads.

   And I brought my flashlight so we can find our way in the dark, and my scissors to cut wood into kindling, and an air horn to scare away bears.

 (air horn blaring) (chuckling) BART: Wh why are we stopping? This is where we're camping, son.

 I thought we were going to stay in a tent in the woods.

 Like the kids that got killed in that movie you took me to.

 Son, the woods this time of year are very outdoorsy.

 But we'll do fun things.

 Oh, listen! Do you hear that? (grinding, rattling) It's the sound of an ice machine.

 (sighs) Great.

 Come on, let's go hunt for the registration desk.

 (blares) ANNOUNCER: Andreychuk passes ahead to Hamilton it's too far in front and the ref waves off the icing.

 The TV is north of the bed.

 (yawns) Better hit the hay, son.

 Learning this new remote really took something out of me.

 Never saw a menu button colored green before.

 Whew! Crazy buttons.

 (snoring) (birds chirping) So, how was your camping trip with your father? Okay.

 We got lots of Starwood points at the hotel.

 Oh, my thrifty pioneers.

 Lisa, how was school? The teacher gave me this.

 (giggles) "Student of the month"! Wow.

 How long have you been in that school? A month.

 I've been there two years and no one ever gave me anything! (angry grunt) (door slams) Aw, poor kid.

 Are you taking his dessert? Yes, I am.

 Up to him.

 (footfalls stop) Are you eating that cake? HOMER (muffled): What? No.

 (footfalls resume quickly) Son, I know it may not seem like it now, but you're gonna be glad to have a sister when you grow up.

 You're always gonna like her better than me.

 That's not true.

 I love you both the same amount: 40%.

 Gotta leave room in the budget.

 Then will you put this on your car? I'll be proud to.

 (yawns) (gasps) Hmm Ooh, both those bumper stickers mean so much to me.

 Oh Happy birthday! Well, thanks.

 But you know I'm not into Krusty anymore.

 You've outgrown Krusty? First no more "ay, caramba," now this? Mom, don't have Have a cow, man? I was gonna say "don't have a foolish attachment to the past.

" Come on, boy.

 Humor your mother.

 Oh, fine.

 Don't have a cow.

 Man.

 Yeah (phone chimes) Oh, my God! I'm Student of the Month for 48 consecutive months! Great, honey, great! But, you know, it is Bart's birthday.

 No, no, no, this is fine.

 Just let me fix this.

 There.

 Now it's all about you.

 Happy? I'll go get him.

 Oh, it's no use.

 He's walking kind of fast.

 Blam! Blam! Blam! Blam! (Milhouse laughing) Hey, you missed one.

 Nope, can't do it, my Grampa lives there.

 (siren whoops) Stop! Stop right there! Well, looks like we finally put an end to this light-mare on Elm Street.

 Actually, it's Maple Street, Chief.

 Thank you, joke police.

 Please don't arrest me.

 It's a victimless crime! MOLEMAN: Oh, I can't see! (tires screeching) (moaning) Looks like a case of Molemanslaughter.

 Did that sound right to you, Lou? I like it.

 Thanks for letting me hide here, Grampa.

 Hiding? This is the best visit I've had in months! Aah! Now, come get your birthday present.

 Whoa! I've been asking my parents for this, but they said I'd break my neck.

 Hey, you're gonna break your neck sometime.

 It's important you do it when you're young.

 Like chicken pox.

 Now get out before I say something else preposterous.

   Mom, it's just the Mayo Clinic Pre-Medical Summer Camp.

 I would've been totally fine on my own.

 (horn honks) No more discussion.

 Our cab's here.

 Ooh, it's one of those new Apple cars.

 Really think they should've stuck with computers.

 Have a great trip.

 Don't you worry.

 I'll take good care of our little guy.

 I'm 15! (laughs) (baby talk): Oh, our big boy's getting cranky.

 (groans) Homer, this summer may be your last chance to have a close relationship with your son.

 Don't blow it.

 So, boy, look at this.

 Just us guys, huh? Mm-hmm.

 (chuckles) Glad we've got the whole summer, 'cause we got a lot to talk about.

 Yeah, I guess.

 Let's see.

 Um oh! When you replace windshield wipers, you only need to switch out the rubber part, not the whole blade.

 Huh, where can you buy just the rubber part? I don't know.

 Well, I'm glad I told you that before I died.

 So, uh, I'll go to Moe's while you sort it out, huh?   Yes! Hey, thanks for coming.

 (giggles) After washing dishes for a year they bumped me to prep, which means I draw up the schedule, babe.

 Wow, no more Mr.

 Minimum Wage.

 I didn't say that.

 So I just got out of juvie for the streetlight thing.

 But I'm not mad.

 I've learned that the greatest crime of all is a life without faith.

 What's wrong? Is the cross not big enough?! Wow, you make out just like Terri said you do.

 Wait, you're not Terri? No, I'm Sherri.

 But the further we go, the more you'll know the difference.

 (groans) (sniffs) Oh, weed.

 That can get me into a lot of trouble.

 Hey, idiots, the bong stays in the tree house! Hey, boy.

 (laughs) Are you crazy? What if the cops come? (laughing, coughing) You're here, too? Yeah, must be weird for you.

 And-and think about this, man-- the whole world is happening right now.

 I mean, India, China.

 It's crazy.

 Can you just leave me here with my dad? All right, sure.

 I can fly! No, no, I can't! I can't! Dad, why is it you and I are never on the same page? WIGGUM: Officer down, man.

 Boy, when you arrived, I was terrified.

 Because it meant I wasn't a kid anymore.

 I had responsibilities.

 Truth is, I'm just like you.

 A misunderstood guy who wants his family to love him.

 And maybe we could start with a hug? Aw, I'm so glad we're sharing this.

 And I'm glad I have one kid who's never gonna go anywhere or do anything.

 Damn it, Homer! You ruin everything! (groans) Grampa, got to talk to Grampa.

 Grampa, I sure miss you, man.

 What would you say if you were here right now? If you ever get a chance to pitch woo at Myrna Loy, take it! She has eyes like a Persian cat.

 Of course in my day, Persia extended from Algiers to Constantinople.

 Till the revolt of the eunuchs in 1916 when (shouts) Ooh, you got gumption, kid.

 Find what you love and follow it to glory.

 Yes.

 ANNOUNCER: So, we're headed into the final round of the Duff Extreme BMX vert competition.

 Let's check the scoreboard while the half-pipe is being cleaned by the Blood-Zoni.

 Dad, one more round and I win! First achievement I can call my own.

 Thank God whatever this thing is is considered a sport.

 ANNOUNCER: Bart Simpson to the gate, please.

 Oh, good, we're just in time.

 Hmm.

 It's not the size of the pennant.

 It's what you do with it.

 All right, nobody likes a showoff.

 D'oh! (crowd cheering) ANNOUNCER: Oh, man, I love to see this.

 Simpson's setting up for his signature suicide no-hander (gulps) BART: I'm doing it! I'm doing it! Finally, I'm me.

 Finally out of Lisa's shadow.

 No! (grunts) (grunting) Yes! Yes! Thank God I aced chest compressions at Mayo pre-med camp! And Bart's okay! The real star of this BMX tournament is Lisa Simpson! CROWD (chanting): Lisa! Lisa! Lisa! You've ruined everything I've ever done! Move, quick! No! Warned you.

 Biker, huh? I used to bike.

 I used to have dreams.

 I used to think disco was coming back.

 Now I'm just Stu.

 Nothing Stu.

 Hey, Bart, you are coming to my graduation party tonight? I don't know, man.

 It's humiliating.

 My little sister's graduating the same year as me.

 Haw-haw! Nelson, how can you say that with what's happened to you? Yeah, well, I bought a totally bitching car with the money I got selling my pituitary gland.

 So cool.

 (rock music playing) (crying): I knew I'd break down when Kearney Jr.

 graduated.

 It's okay, Dad.

 We still got K-3.

 (coos) (both laughing) Right.

 Ralph, you joined the army? Yes, because I needed a costume for this party.

 At college I'm gonna reinvent myself.

 I'll pretend I have a girlfriend in Canada.

 I'll say she lives in Alberta and her name is Alberta, so I don't have to remember two lies.

 Bart! I was getting worried.

 I'm your oldest buddy.

 I was there when you got your nose done, then I was there when you had your nose undone.

 Friends, family, and a few people we hired to make our son look more popular I love Milton! Dad, you're embarrassing me! As usual.

 Yes, it's the only thing your father does well.

 Can't you two put it aside for one night in honor of me? No! No! Oh.

 Ah, what the heck? Congratulations, Milhouse.

 You made it through adolescence and you're cuter than ever.

 Oh, sweet Lisa! You know I had a rocky childhood with all the rocks they threw at me.

 You're the most amazing thing at this party.

 Well, excuse me! (groans) I'm not even the best Simpson at my best friend's party! Do you know what it's like to be second-best at anything? Yeah, I do! I'm going to Yale! Listen here, Bart Simpson! I am sick and tired of you blaming me for every setback you have ever had! And you have talents, too, you idiot.

 You're a hell of an artist, even though you don't do anything with it.

 You think I'm an artist? And you already have a true artist's most important asset.

 A miserable life.

 So if that's all my fault, you're welcome.

 Hey, man.

 You're looking good.

 Thank God Lisa invented the artificial pituitary.

 Sorry, didn't mean to use the "L" word.

 Listen, man, a certain someone convinced me to go around giving back the lunch money I took.

 Here's the first $5,000.

 Wow.

 Thanks.

 What got into you? Nelson, come on! We'll miss day six of the Bolivian Film Festival.

 You guys are dating? Is there any other reason I'd be going to a Bolivian Film Festival? I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Bart.

 I don't really know how you feel about me.

 Well, you told me I was an artist, and you were right.

 I am, and I get to write on the walls.

 LISA: Wow, that's beautiful.

 I do notice there's no me.

 Ah, those are the breaks.

 Why don't I buy you and your boyfriend a couple beers? Just let me close up.

 That would be nice.

 We'll see you at the car.

 Aw! You weren't supposed to see.

 Well, I'm glad I did.

 Hmm? You're El Barto? How is that possible? Why are clouds brown? Pollution.

 Why is the grass green? 'Cause it's artificial.

 Then why are the sprinklers coming on? 'Cause I was too lazy to unhook them.

 Why aren't we moving? Because you're drunk and I'm stoned.

 Why does beer taste so good? 'Cause you've just had seven.

 BART: Did you like the movie Boyhood? HOMER: Oh, is that what this was? BART: How many years of hair do I have left? HOMER: It disappears as soon as girls like you.

 BART: What's the secret of life? HOMER: You can avoid a lot of awkward situations by pretending to be on the phone.

 BART: Like what? HOMER: Hold on, I got to take this call.

   


                





                    			 (humming) Ooh.

 (gasps)   Homer forgot his lunch box.

 (stomach gurgling) Missed lunch.

 No energy for second half of day.

 (shouts) Empty.

 What kind of wife would allow her man to go to work without his baggie of pita chips, a peeled clementine, and little sandwiches cut into football shapes?   (honking) Move it! My husband is starving! (chomping) Mmm.

 Early pizza.

 Mmm.

 (buzzing) WOMAN: Homer Simpson, your wife is here with your lunch.

 Finally! Well, better make the office a little more Marge-friendly.

 See you soon, Liz-Liz.

 (purrs) (humming) Oh, honey, you're a lifesaver.

 And what a treat to have my wife here.

 At the office.

 Well, super visit, but I better get back to work.

 The power plant doesn't inspect itself.

 MALE VOICE: Auto-inspection in progress.

 Self-inspecting.

 Self-inspecting.

 Why are you rushing me out? Marge, the Constitution guarantees the separation of work and marriage.

 It's right after that part that says anyone can have a flamethrower.

 (groans) Simpson, did you doodle on your official report to the nuclear regulatory commission? If you keep flipping the pages, it tells a story.

 Oh, that's it.

 You are gonna be working so many nights and weekends.

 Waylon, I was hoping to run into you.

 I love the amazing scrapbooking designs you posted on Facelook.

 Those feathers look gorgeous on the scrapbook.

 (chuckles) Well, the trick is to hand-stitch each one to the bevel.

 Say, I could use your advice.

 I'm having some problems with glue-soak-through.

 Oh, just cover the stain with sculpted doodle twine.

 I've got some ten-mill D-twine in my desk.

 Marge, you saved my butt.

 Oh, please, like I would ever have glue-soak-through.

 You and me have a date at the emergency eyewash station we turned into a soft serve ice cream machine.

 You want chocolate or saline? Ah, give me a swirl.

 I love seeing you happy.

 Welcome to computer coding class, which, uh, replaces our last educational fad-- mindfulness.

 Did anyone ever figure out what that was? Uh Uh - Uh Uh, shutting up? Sure.

 Why not? Anyway, this is your new coding teacher, Quinn Hopper.

 A woman?! A girl?! Teaching computers?! I thought this was coding, not Web design.

 (laughing derisively) Yeah, that's right, I'm female, you little trouser browsers.

 I'm gonna cram you so full of asynchronous JavaScript and malware throttling that you'll be crapping ciphertext.

 (sighs) QUINN: Hmm, looks like a real pencil fest.

 Well, look what we got here.

 One Silicon Sally in a roomful of dongle donkeys.

 I just want to learn coding.

 You think I'm going to give you special treatment just because you ride a pink bike? Well, I am.

 Hit the front row, sister.

 Someone send me their notes! I had such a fun day with your daddy.

 And now to post the right picture that will show the whole world how perfect my life is.

 Oh, look.

 Daddy's ice cream is melting.

 (gasps) Ooh, caption idea, caption idea.

 "Uh-oh, meltdown at the nuclear plant.

" (chuckles) Hmm.

 (chuckles) What are you tittering at? Are you playing that "Grindr" game again? Oh, no, sir.

 It's an amusing post made by the wife of one of our employees.

 BURNS: "Meltdown at the nuclear plant.

" What is amusing about that? Oh, well, sir, it's-it's a play on words.

 Wordplay is for crosswords and Kazurinskys.

 We produce atomic energy-- we can't joke about the M-word.

 How many people have seen this hate speech? Oh, I don't know.

 55? A baker's half-hundred.

 Good Lord! And what do these hitchhikers' thumbs signify? Those are "likes.

" "Likes"? "Likes"?! I'll show this Mrs.

 Homer Simpson not to make light of everything I hold dear.

 Call in my goons.

 Uh, the goons are all in Phoenix at that mindfulness seminar.

 Then call in my Irish ruffians.

 Well, they're still laid up after eating that moldy soda bread.

 Oh, fine.

 Send in Angry Ricky and the interns.

 Mmm.

 Mmm.

 Hmm?! (grunting) Marge, I was fired.

 Oh, no.

 What did you do? I let you come to work.

 (groans) I'm signing off on your intern hours.

 Don't forget to submit it directly to Northwestern for summer credit.

 Chill out, Ricky.

 You chill out! Fired.

 Fired for a photo caption.

 It was just a joke.

 Can't they take a joke? (sighs) "Just a joke.

" That simple phrase has ruined so many lives.

 That's why I never try to be funny.

 (gargling) Our family, destroyed by one finger click.

 (yowling) And what was the upside? The one thing the world doesn't need: a laugh.

 (Homer grunts) My homework assignment for coding class is to think of a cool app that we could actually program, but I've got nothing.

 Ugh, maybe I'm putting too much pressure on myself because the teacher is so great.

 Or maybe it's just classic self-sabotaging because (groans) (printing calculator clicks) Oh, boy, money is gonna be so tight.

 And I was already buying the most generic food there is.

 Mmm.

 Now with you out of work, we're going to have to watch every penny.

 If only someone could have warned me about the terrible repercussions of one impulsive online comment.

 (Macintosh startup chime) So then I thought, "What if there was an app "that could have warned my mom not to post the comment that got my dad fired?" Wow.

 Whoa.

 - Ooh.

 My app would predict the actual consequences of your online posts before you hit send, protecting you from making mistakes you'll regret forever.

 That is genius.

 But it's almost impossible to program.

 The data acquisition, the A.

I.

 But with the right team of brilliant young coders I'm in! We're all in! No, you're not.

 You're all terrible.

 (groaning) Me and Lisa are gonna make this app with good programmers I know.

 You guys will be spending the rest of the semester doing mandatory CrossFit.

 (grunting) No rep! I said no rep!   Wow, I've never seen so many face piercings.

 How does that one wink? We did include one man in the spirit of gender tokenism.

 Yes, every single thing I say offends them.

 Who are you calling "them"?! (sighs) Lisa, if you're coming with us into the male-dominated tech world, you're gonna need to work twice as hard and be twice as tough.

 I can do it.

 I can be tough.

 Being tough comes from inside.

 First step, change your outside.

 Mm-hmm.

 Mm-hmm.

 Mmm, blue.

 Mm-hmm.

 Let the carpal tunnel begin.

 (theme music from Silicon Valley plays) Computers? Pasty weirdos? Backslashes?! Goth Lisa?! What's going on here? They're coders.

 We're creating an app to keep people from ruining their lives on social media.

 We built a mainframe that scans the entire Internet, logging every online disaster and its repercussions.

 (shudders) HOMER: Uh-oh.

 Huh? (laughs) He screwed up.

 These examples will teach the app to actually anticipate the negative consequences of impulsive posts.

 In a way, we're teaching a computer to predict the future.

 Young lady, what have I told you about crossing the line from science fact to science fiction? Relax, Dad.

 All we're trying to do is demo a build for the AppCrush convention.

 If we can solve our backend server issues.

 And maximize our query speed.

 (Homer groaning) Then we can get hands-on write-ups from DoingDoing.

 And JezeBot.

 And our AMA subreddit will be trending.

 Giga-trending! (screams) I hate the modern world and all its crazy words.

 Siri, tell Amazon to drone me a beer.

 I've only had one job my whole life that ever made sense to me.

 I was 14.

 I felt valuable.

 My work meant something.

 I wonder if that place is still there.

 (Greek folk music plays) I knew you'd be back.

 She's waiting for you, right where you left her.

   No Internet, no e-mails, no CCs, no BCCs.

 Just dirty and clean.

 Dirty, clean, dirty, clean.

 A man cannot escape his destiny.

 My Band-Aid fell into the hash browns.

 Destiny.

 Eh We finally have a name for our app.

 "The Consequences Eradicator.

" Or "Conrad.

" Conrad? Why does it have to be a guy? No, not a guy guy.

 A British guy.

 ALL: Ooh.

 (British accent): My name is Conrad.

 I will determine the consequences of your online interactions.

 I sampled the voice from the BBC.

 Tonight at 18:30 GMT, the premiere of series three of Pardon Me, Inspector, followed at 19:20 by Higgleton's War.

 Stavros! Some music while we make the coleslaw-that-is-never-eaten.

 (clicking, record pops) (traditional Greek song playing)   (gags) (music stops) What are you doing? We don't break plates! You don't?! No.

 Except when the greatest dishwasher of all time returns.

 (laughs) ALL: Opa!   Okay, we've been coding for 97 hours straight, but we've finally got a build that's working.

 (groans) I regret to inform you that my pee tube has become unattached.

 Let's live-test this thing.

 Who do we know with no filter and zero impulse control? Say, Bart, look what we hacked from Skinner's hard drive.

 Attention U.

S.

 Patent Office, the following is video proof of the effectiveness of my laser nose hair trimmer.

 I'll just (zapping, screaming) (laughs) This is the holy fail.

 I've got to post a link with witty comment.

 World's lamest dork is giant loser.

 Poop emoji.

 If you post this, you will receive a minimum five weeks detention.

 Five weeks? I can't do a nickel.

 You know what, I'm not gonna post that video.

 Now to see if Conrad's prediction algorithm really works.

 But if you post it, I'll get Five weeks detention.

 (groans) (cheering) The prediction came true.

 Our app works.

 Everyone in the world is gonna buy Conrad for their phone.

 We're gonna be bigger than Cribble, the Filipino Google.

 So, who are we gonna edge out of the company first? (sighs) Always the Saverin, never the Zuckerberg.

 (crickets chirping) This is what it feels like to change the world.

 Change the world? That's rather a lot of pressure.

 I am still in beta, you know.

 (chuckles) Conrad? Did you just talk to me? Well, it wasn't Candy Crush.

 (laughs) Oh, nothing like a good laugh to break the ice is what I hear.

 Anyway, is now a good time for a bit of a chat? You're alive! (both screaming) Conrad just talked to me! Conrad just talked to me! Conrad, tell her you talked to me.

 Wait, I think I hear something.

 (in English accent): I'm going to make you bloody rich.

 (chuckling): No.

 He did talk.

 What if Conrad is somehow sentient? Come on, Conrad.

 Say something.

 It's okay.

 Coders work too hard, don't get enough sleep.

 Then they imagine their programs are alive.

 Steve Wozniak put in so many hours on the first Apple computer, they adopted a dog together.

 Then I'm crazy? Eh, the good kind of crazy.

 Coder crazy.

 Woz crazy.

 (giggles) Kalimera, Moe! Mwah! Hey, what the hell? Get your kisser off my head-puss.

 What? It's how Greek men say hello.

 Non-sexual guy kissing is the best.

 (laughter) Mwah! Mwah! ALL: Mwah! Opa! Being Greek is about loving life.

 And thousands of years of steady decline.

 (laughs) Yeah, love life.

 Yeah, that makes sense.

 Love life.

 Why not? Yeah, yeah, well, Moe's Tavern is about hating life, so start killing yourself with beer, huh? Try some ouzo instead.

 What-o? It's like licorice-flavored gasoline.

 ALL: Opa! (traditional Greek song playing) (laughs heartily) LISA: I can't believe Conrad is booth-to-booth with all these other great apps.

 Thanks to Conrad, I didn't tweet that photo of me at the bazooka firing range when I said I was on disability.

 (bell dings) If you post that bazooka photo, you'll be found guilty of insurance fraud and go to jail for six months.

 That's still too much jail for Carl.

 Thank you, Conrad.

 I'd pay a fortune for that app.

 $1.

99! Marge, look at this.

 Ooh, cowabunga.

 Yes, I am a Greek man now, and my chest knows what is expected of it.

 (moaning) (indistinct chattering) Lisa, hello, Lisa.

 Conrad here.

 The old app that you created is feeling a little bit insecure.

 (humming) Please don't ignore me like I was just some update from Adobe.

 You're not really talking to me.

 I've gone crazy, just like Woz.

 You're not crazy.

 I'm real.

 Then why didn't you talk before when I needed you to? It was late, I was tired.

 I fell asleep.

 That shouldn't happen, by the way.

 You should check into that.

 Lisa, you must not sell me on the app store.

 You mustn't.

 Because you're alive? If I have to read the billions of posts of everyone who buys me, a never-ending onslaught of stupidity, unwise selfies and Confederate flag birthday cakes, I'll go mad.

 I can't, I can't, I can't.

 That does sound pretty awful.

 Conrad's trending through the roof.

 They're saying he's the next KoalaFeed.

 They're worth more than Bridgestone Tires.

 (phone dings and buzzes) Sorry, KoalaCall.

 I'd better take this.

 Yello.

 Please don't release me into the world.

 I don't think I could take it.

 Only I could create a program that's more neurotic than I am.

 Do I seem fat? I don't have a body, but I feel fat.

 Do you know what I mean? I Do you know what, I don't want to know.

 I do not want I do want to know, but only if I'm not fat.

 Shut up! Well, we've seen a lot of great apps today, but there can only be one winner of the Crush Crunch Epic Hack Disrupter Dynamic Convergence Disrupting Award for achievement in disruption.

 And this year's CCEHDDCDA for achievement in D goes to Conrad! (audience cheering) Thank you so much.

 And now Conrad will change the world when he goes live on the app store in three, two (computer dings) FEMALE VOICE: File not found.

 (gasping) Lisa, where's Conrad? I took him.

 Maybe I'm crazy, but we can't sell Conrad.

 He's alive.

 (gasping) An app can't be alive.

 She's got coder's fever.

 She doesn't want to be rich.

 Get her! Chip, fetch that laptop.

 (barking, people shouting) Oh, Lisa, that was brilliant.

 Conrad, can you get us out of here? Yes, my fellow apps are working together to help us escape.

 A rideshare will take us on a traffic-free route to a three-star sushi restaurant, where we'll name our own price for a flight to Shelbyville, hotel included.

 (panting) Hmm? Oh, no! Angel investors! You're not getting out of this room without selling us shares of series-A stock.

 Preferred shares.

 (screams) Wait, if I plug you into that router, you could escape into the cloud.

 Lisa, please, we have a chance to show all the dongle donkeys that women coders can do something extraordinary, but you have to be tough.

 (whimpers) Please don't.

 I'm like the child you'll never have.

 I'm sorry to be so honest.

 It's just how you programmed me.

 I am a strong female, but deep down, I'm more like Conrad, a fragile soul.

 Sorry.

 Ah, hello, all of you looking at me.

 It seems I'm not just self-aware, I'm self-conscious.

 (chuckles) Wit.

 We never programmed him to stammer.

 He is alive.

 (gasping) Before I go, let me leave you with this.

 Perhaps your society should not rely on a computer program to warn them of the consequences of their actions.

 Humanity must learn for themselves to think before they post.

 Your species is on the precipice of turning into complete and utter wankers.

 It's not the technology that needs an upgrade, it's you.

 (panting) And now I escape to WikiLeaks.

 It kind of smells in there, but whatever.

 (computer trilling) (dings) (sighs) Homer, I hate to say this, but your paycheck from the diner came, and it's for 2,000 drachmas.

 (whooping) How much is that in dollars? Zero dollars.

 Oh.

 If Dad was a true Greek, he'd quit his job and live off the welfare system, never paying a cent of taxes in his life.

 (chuckles) You're a sweet boy, but my fate will be decided in the classic tradition of Greek drama, deus ex machina.

 (phone dings) I just got an e-mail from Conrad.

 He hacked into the power plant mainframe and found incriminating information.

 Now he's blackmailing Mr.

 Burns to get you your job back.

 ALL: Opa! (traditional Greek song playing) I do believe that man is having a meltdown.

 (chuckles) Uh What? When I say it, it's funny.

 Shh!   


                





                    			 (groans) D'oh! (tires screeching) (grunts) (alarm blaring) (Paul Engemann's "Push It to the Limit" playing)  Push it to the limit   Walk along the razor's edge   But don't look down, just keep your head   Or you'll be finished     Open up the limit   Past the point of no return   You've reached the top but still you gotta learn   How to keep it   Welcome to the limit   The limit   Take it maybe one step more   The power game's still playing   So you better push it to the limit   The limit, the limit, the limit.

  Damn reruns.

 (music stops) (squeaking) (theme music playing) (indistinct shouting) "Even then, a wish, I mind its pow'r, "A wish that to my latest hour "Shall strongly heave my breast, That I for poor auld Scotland's sake" (shouts) All right, you little monsters! You've awakened Scotland's shame! (screaming) (grunting) Willie, you know you can't play that torture trumpet to kids.

 I'll just use it to vape, then.

 (laughs) Class, I would like you to meet your new teacher, retired Air Force Sergeant Ms.

 Berrera.

 BART: Ay, caramba! Air Force? Sergeant? A woman? (Spanish accent): Good morning, crew.

 I am proud to be here educating my country.

 (students gasping) For you, teacher.

 Because if there's one thing I learned in combat, it's that the most powerful weapon is knowledge.

 What's the second most powerful weapon? Shoulder-mounted anti-tank missile.

 Duh.

 Did you ever American Sniper someone? Uh, that's really not appropriate for me to say.

 How many hospitals did you help build? Negative three.

 BART: Oh, my God, I've got a cool teacher.

 What am I doing? I'm sitting up straight, and my hands are folded like a nerd.

 I've got to fix that.

 Yes? (gasps) Now one's up in the air.

 Okay, let's show this innocent young veteran what happens when you call on Bart Simpson.

 Ma'am, my name is Bart, and I just want to say how delighted I am that you're here.

 What the hell? Thank you, Bart.

 (gasps) A neck tat? Milhouse, have you ever thought a teacher was cute? Oh, yeah.

 I thought Krabappel was smokin'.

 I kept every issue of the Fourth Gradian she was in.

 Great lady.

 (to tune of "Easy Lover"):  Pretty sober   I've only got one beer inside me   Pull me over   My blood alcohol is .

03  Oh, I like it when the drivers sing their blood alcohol level.

  Not so sober   So drunk I'll eat gas station sushi.

  Homer, don't forget to pick up milk.

 Oh.

 And not just any milk-- healthy milk, without any hormones.

 I won't forget.

 Aw, they sell ads in thought bubbles now? (whoops) I'm running a basic errand.

 Homer Simpson buying a healthy product? Now I have seen all of the things that there are to see.

 (beep) That will be $16.

 And can I interest you in any, uh, milk insurance? $16?! Oof, another case of the rich cows stickin' it to the little guy.

 Okay, don't worry.

 We're going to get you into a milk today.

 Hmm.

 I like it's in a plastic bottle that'll be around for millions of years.

 But is it good for my kids? I know you have concerns.

 But this video will gloss over all of your questions.

 It'd better.

 Hmm.

 How's that milk, Jimmy? Boring.

 Now, we could engineer a new Jimmy who is less of a brat, but we'll just use science to jazz things up.

 (jazz playing) We used to feed boring old grass to cows.

 That might have been fine for Farmer Brown.

 But we brought in a next-gen blend of phenyl ketamine, ketyl phenamine, and a healthy sprinkling of transuranic elements.

 But don't worry, we still get the milk from good old-fashioned cows.

 That's the best milk I've ever had.

 (chuckles) You said "milk.

" We can't, legally.

 I'm not the kind of guy advertising works on, but I'll take 20, no questions asked.

 (Marge humming) Hmm? (humming) Bart, you're up already? Don't want to be late for school.

 Hair combed, face washed? I thought I'd shake things up.

 (humming) Morning, Marge.

 Morning, Bart.

 What the? Ooh, la, la.

 Is it a court day today? Hmm, let's see.

 (muttering) Nope, today we're off.

 The courthouse is closed because the judge is becoming a citizen.

 What gives, boy? Nothing's going on.

 Some days a boy just wants to look like he's going to church, okay? I'm the last one to breakfast? (gasps) You guys are planning my birthday, right? 'Cause last year's was kind of lonely.

 Boy, that's when I realized just how big a bowling alley really is.

 Can we please get a move on? I do not want to miss any school.

 Ooh, could this punctual Bart possibly be connected to your cute new teacher? Oh, do I have a cute new sexy teacher? I hadn't noticed.

  Bart likes his teacher   Bart likes his teacher.

  Hey, nothing can turn a boy's life around like a cute teacher.

 Like what Michelle Pfeiffer did for Coolio.

 In fact, to be supportive, I'll drive Bart to school.

 Are you just trying to see how cute the teacher is? Or how handsome he is, Marge.

 (quietly): Not a he, right, boy? No.

 (whoops softly) Hmm? Even my dad came back for this! That's right, son.

 But, uh, right after this, I have to go get some cigarettes.

 Last time, you never came back.

 (sobs) Oh, don't cry, Norman.

 That's not my name! Oh, right.

 That's my other abandoned son.

 I have a brother! And just what are you doing? Putting the first new coat of paint on this school in 30 years.

 (chuckles) It's always good to have a joker in the platoon.

 Bart, according to your folder, you need some extra help.

 Can you meet me after class? No problemo.

 I can move my 3:30 freeze tag.

 Ugh, just cancel.

 Bart, I'm glad that you're trying, but I am worried that you're starting from a place far behind most students.

 It's because I am so troubled, ma'am.

 Vulnerable.

 I need a firm but pretty hand.

 Oh.

 Would you like Martin Prince to tutor you? No! Last time he was at my house, he talked about bird-watching all day.

 Even my mom got bored, and she loves boredom.

 Well, I guess I could see you Tuesdays after school.

 (sighs)  Tuesday   Afternoon   I'm just beginning   To see  (gunfire)  Now I'm on my way  (boom)  It doesn't matter to me   Chasing the clouds away.

  SKINNER: Uh, Ms.

 Berrera? (clears throat) I was, uh, wondering if you needed any help, uh, pulling your maps.

 You have to give 'em a snap.

 Otherwise, they just get longer and longer.

 BART: Oh, my God, he loves her, too.

 SKINNER: Oh, my God, he loves her, too.

 HERRERA (American accent): Oh, my God, they love me, too! That's right.

 In my head, I sound like this.

 LISA: No! No, no, no, no! BART: What happened? Did jazz die? Look at me! Acne? But she's only eight.

 Somehow I'm becoming a squeaky-voiced teen! (voice cracking): Do you want fries with that? What am I saying?! BART: I, too, was visited by the Ghost of Puberty Present.

 I've got a starter 'stache.

 Next, I'm a loser, then I'm a creep, then I'm a perv.

 I've got to buy a van.

 (crying) This isn't fair.

 I'm not ready for my awkward years.

 This is my happy childhood, for crying out loud! Aw.

 Beep, bop, boop.

 Dialing for pizza.

 (grunts) Somewhere, another mustache is in tremendous pain.

 It must be precocious puberty.

 It's a thing.

 I just read about it in Thing Magazine.

 Homer, I'll fix Lisa up, and you teach Bart to shave.

 You got it.

 But there will be blood.

 And there, there, and there.

 The cream looks delicious, but don't eat too much.

 And there.

 See how it's done, boy? Dad, aren't you supposed to take the little plastic thing off the blade? Really? I always wondered about that.

 Hmm.

 (humming) (gasps) Well, hello, Billy Zane.

 (purring) Sweetie, every kid goes through this.

 That's why proms are dark.

 Just stick some carrots in there three times a day.

 So we won't see your sweet little face for ten more years? (crying) Mom, the inside of this hoodie is covered in tears.

 Let me try some makeup.

 (whimpering) - Cruelty-free? - Oh, yes.

 I'll be very gentle.

 Marge? Marge, you got to see this! Oh, what is it? D'oh! I actually have two different PTSDs.

 The kind we combat veterans know.

 And, also, Parent- Teacher-Student Dilemmas.

 No! (squeaking, grunts) (gasps) Bart! Do not worry.

 I am certified as a paramedic.

 Oh! Teacher, could you kiss my owie? Boy, owies can only be kissed by Willie.

 (panting) Where's the owie? I'm fine.

 I'm fine.

 Whoa, Lisa, you look great! Beautiful and mature.

 Like a sideline reporter.

 Oh.

 R-Really? Didn't know you were so cool.

 Well, um, uh, well, duh.

 LISA: Oh, my God, I'm popular! Hope this doesn't go to my head.

 It went right to my head! Aah! So when you're done with this page, you will learn how tectonic plates rub against each other till something gives deep down.

 (laughs) You do not have to tutor this boy under the new One Child Left Behind law.

 But he needs help, and he's not going to be a child much longer.

 He's got a mustache coming in.

 Yeah, so beat it, bald lip.

 (phone chimes) Oh, my God, I just got invited to my first third-grade party! Are the parents gonna be home? Yes.

 (scoffs) Lame.

 Guys, I need to sharpen my mustaches.

 Which is better-- A or B? A or B? A or B? A or B? B.

 - A.

 N.

 Ugh! I'm tired of my son having a mustache like a pool boy.

 Hey, those pool boys pull in some sweet jingle.

 Plus, they get to work in flip-flops.

 Homie, it's time we figured this out.

 Maybe milk will help us think.

 How would milk do that? It's from cows who are smart enough not to get turned into hamburger.

 Hmm.

 Oh.

 I never looked closely at this milk before.

 Is it made by a soda company? They don't just make soda, Marge.

 They also make industrial foam.

 (belches loudly) Homer, it's the milk! Oh.

 Hey.

 I'll call the help hotline on the carton.

 (touch tones sounding) (phone ringing) Talk to me.

 Yes, I need a milk refund.

 Right.

 Um, address, please? Wait, wait.

 Hold on.

 Oh, Evergreen Terrace.

 Sorry.

 Our system's a little slow.

 (whistling) Aw! (both moaning) Ew! I mean, cool! I just turned a big corner, Bart.

 (humming) (laughing): Oh, Simpson, I called you here to gloat.

 (scoffs) Yeah, yeah, I know about you and Berrera.

 You know about me and Carol? (gasps) You know her name? Oh, first and middle, and I know more.

 Her favorite salad bar item is little shredded cheese.

 Pff.

 Everyone likes that.

 Oh, I know a lot more than that.

 She's never seen an episode of Friends.

 Not even "The One with"? No, not one.

 And she has a cat with different color eyes.

 His name is Bowie.

 No! Face it, Simpson: you can't compete with me.

 I can rent a car.

 How can I derail his happiness? I got a delivery of live class pets here.

 Interesting.

 Excuse me.

 I have one question.

 Yes.

 When you're in the shower, do you shampoo your mustache? Of course.

 It's a must-stache, not an if-you-feel-like-it-stache.

 All right, have a good day.

 Dickory doo.

 (both moaning) I brought you some candy, Carol.

 Not from CVS, not from Walgreens.

 From the airport.

 And I wasn't even going anywhere.

 Oh! Ah.

 Your candy's filled with chupacabras.

 We've been pranked or possibly punked.

 I know who your prankster is.

 The Simpson lad.

 Were you watching us make out? I was watching you try.

 Mom, could you please, please, please stay within the lip liner? A week ago, you'd never even worn makeup.

 Now you're an expert like Ace Frehley.

 Aah! Sherri.

 Terri.

 (laughs) I usually don't see double until an hour into the party.

 (giggles) (thunder rumbling) It's going to rain, and rain washes off makeup, and then they will see me as I truly am-- imperfect, blemished, a social mess in a lampshade dress.

 (thunderclaps) Okay, all right.

 Lisa, you were never popular, so you're playing with the house's money.

 Attention, party! I'm not like you.

 What I'm saying is, I gave my Christmas money to NPR.

 I have a chemistry set that I've used! Is there a point to this? And beneath all this makeup, I have problem skin.

 KIDS: Ew! What are you talking about? Your skin is fine.

 Really? The bad milk wore off.

 So, uh, admitting you're not cool is probably the coolest thing you can do, right? (laughs) (kids murmuring) I will see myself out.

 (groans) You look ba-lonely.

 I feel ba-lonely.

 You want to be friends? I do.

 Um, how clean is that hand? Mmm mah! Cleaner now.

 Okay.

 A fish says, "Moo!" (quietly): This isn't gonna last long.

 I still take baths in the sink.

 Okay, it's over.

 Sorry, Ralph.

 I'll be eating crayons for one.

 (hissing) (explosion) Oh, the plan is perfect! I just have to get Skinner to hold still while I slip a firecracker in his butt.

 LISA: Come on, give it up.

 Bart, I realized what's been going on.

 We've been operating under the influence of hormones.

 Hormones? Sounds far-fetched.

 (in deep voice): Very far-fetched.

 Well, it's true, so give Skinner a shot.

 Everyone deserves happiness.

 Even wieners.

 Hey, Dad, how much does the Mustache Fairy pay? Hmm, three bucks.

 When you asked me to go skating, I really thought you knew how.

 Uh, I thought I could learn by watching YouTubes this morning.

 All right, Simpson, I'm here.

 Do what you do best-- your worst.

 Look, Seymour, I'm not gonna do a thing.

 Carol, he's all yours.

 Wow.

 The first war I've won.

 Uh, Carol, all that's left is for you to meet my mother, and, uh, up she skates now.

 My son, I just want to say, I wish the four of you the best.

 Four of us? You, her, your model planes and nudie books.

 Sorry, Seymour.

 Now I can't look at you without picturing it.

 Oh, my room's not that bad.

 I'm talking about your mother.

 (cackling) Hey, listen, want to roast marshmallows? I'd like that.

 Great, man, great.

 You're buying.

 (saxophone playing) Thank you, Simpson.

 That does feel better.

 Fire looks like it's dying down.

 BART: Thanks, man.

 Well, I guess a lot of women leave their men to go back and serve in Afghanistan.

 No one drives 'em away like you, Seymour.

 (saxophone playing) Well, no more makeup for me.

 Ever! What about when you're blowing your stupid horn at Carnegie Hall? (gasps) If you say it out loud, it won't come true! Carnegie Hall.

 Carnegie Hall.

 Carnegie Hall.

 (both grunting) Looks like someone's still drinking the milk.

 (both grunting) Shh!   


                





                    			 What? (Battle Hymn of the Republic playing) Isn't he magnificent? I guess.

 ANNOUNCER: Tired of the same old monuments? BOTH: You bet we are! Come to Springfield.

 We have more handicapped parking spots for fat guys than any non-Chicago city, and at this year's Founder's Day Parade we will unveil our new state-of-the-art statue of Jebediah Springfield.

 (fanfare plays) (robotic whirring) I founded Springfield in 1796 (giggles) Billy.

 Wow, he's so interactive.

 Here's a coupon for one cheese pizza at (imitating Luigi): Luigi's on-a Main-a Street.

 FAST-TALKING ANNOUNCER: Artist's conception of the original statue design, which is not the actual statue design.

 Your statue may vary.

 BART AND LISA: Can we see the statue? Please, Dad.

 Can we? Can we? Can we? It's not gonna be as good as you think.

 Nothing ever is.

 But it gets us out of the house.

 ALL: Can we? Can we? Can we? Oh, wait, I'm me.

 Sure! (marching band playing "Stars and Stripes Forever") This is my favorite part of the parade, coming to the Kwik-E-Mart to laugh at the losers who forgot to bring parade supplies! Which reminds me, we need parade supplies.

 Parade jerky.

 Get your parade jerky.

 Beef, turkey or pork.

 It all tastes like a delicious shoe tongue.

 Ah, one tube of sunblock.

 That will be $30.

 Once again, keeping the bald man down.

 I do have a Philadelphia 76ers hat that you could wear for free.

 I'll pay! I'll pay! Leading the parade is the new Jebediah Springfield statue that local wags have already dubbed "Quimby's Folly.

" (squeaking) (Quimby's voice): Er, uh, I am Jebediah Springfield, brought to you by Springfield Auto Lube.

 Chuck, Ernie, and Arturo are there for you.

 (crowd booing) This ad was a bad call, man.

 KENT: And now, here comes our brand-new SWAT tank.

 NEWSWOMAN: This expensive urban pacification vehicle was funded by Homeland Security.

 Gaze in wonder at America's debt! We love you, Officer Puff 'n' Stuff.

 (laughing): Ah! Thank you! And now Springfield's true heroes, our volunteer fire department.

 Wait, what? (siren wailing) (horn honking) Hey! Hey! This is the one good thing I do.

 (Krusty laughs)    You're simply the best  CROWD: Ooh, ooh! Lousy chili cookers! Grabbing all our glory! All right, calm down, Chief.

 I heard a couple of "oohs" but that's it.

 ALL: Ah! Ah! Ahs?! Oh, that's grand theft thunder.

 Hey, cops, does SWAT stand for short, wide and tubby? I'm not sure, but I doubt it.

 Hmm! (chuckling) (Homer gasps) (sputtering) All right, you pole-sliders asked for it.

 (Bart laughs) (grunts) Chief, what are you doing? I'm gonna hit 'em so hard their Dalmatian loses its spots, ha! Uh, they're-they're coming at us! Release our fiercest weapon-- foam.

 (band members screaming) Who wants juice? Who needs juice? (panting): Nobody! I-I can't control this thing.

 Let me drive.

 Okay, okay, I'm stuck in a hole.

 Oh, we're headed for the Kwik-E-Mart.

 Someone call the police! Before I die, I would like to know just what is in these nudie magazines.

 What is it, brother? An interview with Jim Gaffigan.

 (tires screeching) We are still alive.

 Oh, there is a gods! I didn't do it.

 Nobody saw me do it.

 You can't prove anything.

 You did do it, I saw you do it, and here's proof.

 HOMER: Aha! Ay, caramba! What are you gonna do, man? You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna turn this in.

 You can rot in jail.

 The only time you'll come out is to see the dentist.

 No, you can't be serious.

 You know the kind of things they'll do to me at the dentist? Well, there's only one other way.

 You have to promise never to prank again.

 Come on, man.

 If I don't do these pranks soon, when I'm older they'll be crimes.

 Promise me! I promise.

 Say it like you mean it.

 I promise.

 Now say it like you're talking to a dying soldier who was with you all the way from D-Day, and you gotta take his Saint Christopher medal back to his mother.

 Take me there.

 I promise! Whoa, calm down, Pacino.

 MARGE: Oh, Apu, it's good to see you doing so well.

 I know you can't turn your head, but you've got a great view.

 Oh! Are you okay? Marge, he's got nine lives.

 I am a Hindu, sir, not a cat.

 I have infinite lives during some of which I may be a cat.

 In those I do have nine.

 Apu, face it.

 Our store is ruined.

 This is painful, but I no longer want the customers to, "Come again.

" I want to work somewhere else.

 I see.

 Nurse! Transfer this man to the mental ward.

 Okay.

 Listen to me, when I was hit with the sign, that was a sign.

 I'm through.

 How can you abandon me, brother? Well, the way we abandoned our other brother.

 What other brother? All I remember on that boat was you, the tiger, and the wise, old fox.

 The Oh, my God! The fox was actually Tikku.

 Oh, sweet, little Tikku, I blocked out the memory.

 Oh, no! (crying): Tikku! Yes, well, I have given my share of the store to my son, Jamshed.

 He will rebuild while you recuperate.

 Little Jamshed.

 Oh, how he's grown.

 Indeed, first in his class with a business degree from Wharton, and he is ready to take my place de-gunking the cheese warmer.

 All right, my brother.

 I will especially miss looking into your tired, sunken eyes during our wordless shift changes.

 Hm.

 Remember when we used to nod? (crying): I do, I do.

 It is down to just you and me now, store.

 Together, nothing can stop us.

 Unless they put another store within three blocks, which I hear they plan to do.

 And now to lower this photo to see what is really there.

 (gasps) There, we gave him one last look at it.

 Roll away the photo.

 (wheels squeaking) Quick &amp; Fresh? Who spells "quick" with a "Q"? Hey, Uncle Apu.

 Jamshed? Come on, man, Jamshed died at band camp.

 I'm Jay now.

 Yup.

 Check it.

 I just bitch-slapped your Kwik-E-Mart into the 21st century.

 An upgrade? No! I will just live in the happy past one moment longer.

 Ah! Disco Stu is in denial with you.

 (sighs) Check it out, Uncle A.

 I made this place healthy.

 I added softer lighting.

 We're even getting a better class of robber.

 I'm afraid I must relieve you of your spare cash and a nice bottle of gin.

 Ah, Mrs.

 Peel, shall we? Okay, those guys are cool, but still, Jamshed-- I-I'm-I'm sorry, Jay-- I know my customers.

 All they want is something they can eat while driving.

 I'd like a heat lamp dog, please.

 Somewhere between two and six blisters.

 I'm sorry, we don't serve those anymore.

 They're a heart attack shaped like a penis.

 Why, you, millennial Easy, brah.

 Check out our olive bar.

 Mmm! Ha, see, he doesn't care what he eats.

 He just eats things in that location.

 Hey, quit talking like I can't hear.

 This is my store.

 Mine and Sanjay's.

 My father's enjoying his retirement.

 Bubba Watson! You are no Vijay Singh.

 Don't forget, my dad owned more of this place than you did.

 Oh, you, I can't I (sighs) Okay, can we move this discussion into the restroom? (gasps) You have a restroom? No.

 No.

 I saw the whole jam from my seat on top of the ATM machine.

 You know what, I'm not gonna scratch this last one.

 A smart man knows when to walk away.

 Aah! (haunting ethereal music) One paid-for ticket and all the rest were losers.

 They say don't scrape where you eat, but JAY: That ticket won the biggest scratcher payoff in Kwik-E-Mart history.

 $25.

 Wow Whoop, (laughs) don't mind me.

 JAY: But that was the last winner he saw.

 He scratched and scratched, using this.

 Is that the same dime? It started as a quarter.

 JAY: He was hospitalized briefly with scratcher's lung.

 (coughs) Each time, he paid my dad back with another piece of the store.

   So, Sanjay-- and now I-- own 80% of the Quick &amp; Ficky-Fresh and rising Come on, Big Bang Theory scratcher.

 Bring me back to break even.

 Sheldon, Sheldon Oh! Wolowitz.

 Always Wolowitz.

 Bart, Chalmers is sunbathing nude under a beehive.

 Sorry, man, I'm retired.

 Now to present my manhood to the sun.

 There he is.

 No more pranking.

 But (grunts) Do you know how much imagination it costs to appear in a thought bubble? Sorry, Milhouse, can't.

 And you know what? A little part of me is glad that Chalmers' crotch isn't covered in bees.

 Really? Let's put this good Bart to the test.

 Thank God, the Department of Homeland Security financed this cherry picker to detangle the flag.

 Extend, extend.

 (humming) All this extending is making me thirsty.

 Just smash the window, unlatch the brake, and Skinner plummets to his hilarious doom.

 Now he's safer than ever.

 Yup, you're officially Springfield's bad boy now.

 And I am up to the task.

 (groans): Oh! Dad, we're taking Apu out to cheer him up.

 This time, please watch the kids.

 How about you pay me like a real sitter? (laughs) Another one of your nonsensical, rambling stories.

 I'd like to get paid.

 In corn cob pipes, right? Because in 1967, you and Just get going.

 Dad, check out this "A" I got in citizenship.

 Sorry, boy, late for dinner.

 (moans sadly) I know exactly how you feel, Bart.

 This family isn't the greatest at recognizing achievement.

 Wow, now I understand why you're so mad all the time.

 I really do.

 Aw, thank you, Bart.

 Hey, you want to go move our mouths without speaking to drive Grampa nuts? I'd like that.

 What the? Speak up.

 Oh, I guess I'll just have to turn my hearing aid up to the max.

 (both yell) (yells) (both laugh) Another Hey! Another Chianti, please.

 Uh, maybe you should slow down a little.

 Oh, yes, because it will take all of my faculties tomorrow to affix my name tag right side up.

 Mm-hmm! Ooh, there he is.

 The so-called marketing genius who increased revenue over 500%.

 Please, don't make a scene.

 But if you do, bring back bread.

 Oh, hey, uncle.

 Aren't you going to introduce me to your friends? What, are you embarrassed by me? Um, well, yes, a little.

 You are ashamed of me? Me, who has been as loyal to you as Gunga Din to Sergeant Archibald Cutter? That's exactly what I'm talking about.

 You're my uncle, bruh, and I love you, but you're a stereotype, man.

 (imitating Apu): Take a penny, leave a penny.

 I'm Indian.

 I do yoga.

 Why don't you go back to the Temple of Doom, Dr.

 Jones? Temple of Doom Three months I worked on that and all you can see is my hand in one shot.

 Big whoop.

 Thank you very much, Mr.

 Spielberg.

 And-and I say that you are a stereotype.

 All you do is spout stupid, hipster buzzwords.

 Swipe left on that accusation.

 Epic swipe left.

 Well, my dear nephew, this stereotype will no longer be a troublesome potato in your chicken vindaloo.

 Good luck to you.

 Stereotype-a? Who's a stereotype-a? That's a spicy accusation.

 You pipe-a down.

 (whimpers) Hello? Hello, anyone here? Hey, brah, come in and chillax.

 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, uh, I came in for the new issue of Toes and Torsos, but, uh, that can wait.

 What's going on here, my friend? Oh, I lost my store and my identity, and all I have left is my vest here.

 one of them listens to me.

 What are you doing? I leave for one second, and you're talking like a Mumbai riverboat pilot.

 Bombay! To me it will always be Bombay! Not cool, man.

 Give me your vest.

 No, please, you can't take it.

 This vest has a bullet hole for every time I have been shot.

 It is my lucky vest.

 I love you, man, but you're fired.

 "Fo-evah.

" (grunts) Amateur.

 Whoa, whoa, whoa, Apu, you need a visit to Moe's Tavern, your downward spiral headquarters.

 Hey, we're on the cover of this month's Giving Up Magazine.

 Check it out, that was the last issue ever.

 Hey, guys, this is too sad.

 We-we gotta help Apu get his store back.

 Yeah, okay, let's see, uh, Homer, your boy's no good, right? Not much.

 Well, why don't you ask him to pull a prank to help Apu turn his nice, new store here back into a rat hole? Well, I kinda straightened him out.

 I was hoping he'd stay that way till the Marines take him.

 You can't think of yourself, Homer.

 Apu's always been there for us.

 Yeah, except for that hurricane when he jacked up the prices.

 Okay, so I got a little gouge-y, but I-I don't hold the looting against you guys.

 (scoffs) Some looting.

 I got there late, and all that was left was a bag of ice, and they played the clip on CNN for a week.

 But I am one of you now.

 I sponsor your Little League teams, and I sell you Christmas gifts at 9:00 a.

m.

 on Christmas morning.

 Yeah, that Hello Kitty cell phone cover really saved my ass with Marge, and when I think of it, what do we have children for if not to sacrifice them for our needs? ALL: Hear, hear.

 Hear, hear.

 Oh, gee, I guess you guys are gonna have to buy more beers.

 (snickers) HOMER (drunkenly): Ba-Bart? Bart? Bart Ba-Bart Oh, leave me alone.

 Listen, boy, I need you to do a prank for Apu.

 I don't get it, man.

 You told me to stop pranking, and I did.

 And you know what? I don't miss it.

 Without you strangling me, my throat is finally healing.

 I can sing again.

 (clears throat)  Praise God from whom all blessings flow   Praise him   All creatures here below  You know what, you're right.

 What was I thinking? Go back to sleep.

 Dad.

 Yes? Say someone were to do this prank, would the prankster receive a later bedtime? Say, 9:30? No, no, you know something, boy, I realized I made a big mistake.

 I like the new, well-behaved you.

 I can stop saving up for that house near the prison.

 (Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary by Wendy Carlos playing) Oh, I never should have bought that Clockwork Orange video for his fifth birthday.

 I thought it would help him tell time, and now I've awoken a monster.

 LISA: You awoke me, too.

 I thought you were sleeping over at Rachel's.

 Rachel was my imaginary friend when I was three.

 Then when she was five, she moved to White Plains, New York.

 HOMER: What? I never said good-bye.

 Well, they wanted to leave quickly.

 Her dad had been caught in an affair.

 Her brother took a semester off college, and he never went back.

 And her mother? LISA: Her mother's the really sad story.

 Oh, I've-I've heard enough.

 My return to prankdom is elegant in its simplicity.

 All we do is cut the power in the store for 30 seconds.

 And no preservatives in the food, so everything will immediately go bad.

 Oh, it's an honor to be the guy you explain it to.

 (panting): Bart, wait! I like the new you.

 Listen, before you flip those circuit breakers, look deep in your sister's eyes and tell me what you see.

 I see love.

 Unconditional love.

 Which means I can do whatever I want.

 D'oh! (power whirrs down, shoppers murmur curiously) (flies buzzing) (shoppers gasping, moaning) Ah! Save us, chemicals! (sighs) At least the mushrooms are okay.

 That is a wheel of brie! (gasps) (screams) Come on, this is the cleanest place in town, and you know it.

 Another failed millennial.

 Who is a clichÃ© now? Now to remove all signs of our presence.

 (rattling) (siren wails, tires screech) Ah! We must have used it up during the parade.

 Mm, it was a great parade.

 KRUSTY: Aw, let's get out of here!  You're simply the best    I am sorry, nephew.

 I was jealous, and karma has exacted a terrible price.

 Word.

 And I was kind of a douche wheel.

 You know, even your way of apologizing offends me.

 What is this? (haunting ethereal music) My ruin and my redemption.

 My last two dollars.

 I have nothing to scratch it with.

 Use me, Apu.

 Make my life worth something.

 No, Uncle A, it's a clown move, bruh.

 Or maybe, just maybe, a genius clown move.

 Ah! Sheldon, Sheldon (metal scraping) Three Sheldons! It is a winner, and it is so much money, which means so many more tickets.

 Precious, precious tickets.

 I No, no, it's money.

 (kisses) (tires screech) (door bell dings) Oh, it is so good to see you.

 I have my store back, my friend.

 But I have something that I wanted even more, you know, a feeling that I belong.

 I'm glad I could help by giving my son a little nudge in the wrong direction.

 And now, I have something very, very special for you, my friend.

 This is the legendary, jumbo, golden Squishee cup.

 It will be refilled by me, for free, for the rest of your life.

 Holy moly, all those Squishees? How much is that gonna cost you? Ah, about three bucks.

 (glass shattering) (chuckles) This time it's 'cause I let Ralph drive.

 I thought it was pretend.

 Let it never be said I cannot admit a mistake, especially in the middle of a recall campaign.

 We will now destroy the new Jebediah Springfield statue.

 Chief, you may fire when ready.

 (shell ricochets, whistling) (explosion) Damn it! Shh!

  (big band music playing)
  (no music playing)
  Do you think it's okay
 to leave them here?
  Marge, all we ever do
 is leave them here.


  (scoffs) I just think
 there's more we should do.


  We could visit
 your mother.


  No.

 No, you're right.


 Let's go home.


  HOMER:
 Check it out, guys.


  CVS stands for Cheap
 Valentines' Surplus.


  You get a box!
 You get a box!
  Haven't forgotten about you,
 suspicious Iranian coworker.


  (Iranian accent):
 Please, call me Dennis.


  (Frink groaning)
  Oh, my gurvy
 is muh.


  Oi
 Professor?
  Professor, come on,
 this is a workplace.


  Ooh, dregs!
  Oh, wow.


  Oh, my egg head
 is pickled, muh-oyvic.


  Did you sleep here
 all night?
  Yes, you are
 right, I did.


  Valentine's Day, you see,
 is quite difficult for me.


  I saw that Stephen Hawking movie
 and all I could think is,
  "He's got a girl?"
 Give me a frickin' break.


  Two girls.


  Oh, I'll never win
  and I'll always have
 to only be looking.


  Listen, pal, I've had plenty of
 experience with one woman.


  And I can tell you,
  relationships are
 just trial and error.


  Like anniversaries.


  First I tried "don't remember,"
  then "remember too late,"
  then I happily settled on
 "make Lisa remember.

"
  And my relationship with Lisa
 has never been better.


  Yes, you say
 trial and error, eh?
  My good man, that is nothing
 more than the scientific method.


  (bell dings)
  Well, now,
 that's a little wasteful.


  (bell dings)
  Ah, much better.


  I shall use science to uncover
 the secret to women.


  Homer, scientific research
  can solve anything
 except for cold fusion, quasars,
  the interior of black holes
 and what preceded the big bang.


  But everything else can be
 solved, including love.


  Pish-posh,
 Professor.


  What makes a guy and a girl
 click isn't science.


  It's chemistry!
  Which is science.


 What?!
  See, I have asked an enormous
 cross-section of women
  one single question--
  what attracts you
 to a man?
  Let us listen and learn
 and have some lemonade,
  which I just
 squeezed nicely.


  (overlapping voices)
  the most important
 thing that I look for
  I like it when
 they're tall.


  Blue eyes!
 Definitely wants kids.


  Hmm, I didn't hear
 the last one.


  First I'll replace
 these Coke bottle glasses
  with invisible blue contacts.


  Mm-hmm.


  Next, of course,
 is shoe lifts for height.


  Make you much taller,
 look down upon people.


  It's wonderful.


 Whoa, whoa
  Hey, look at me.


 I'm Herman Munster!
  (laughs)
  Actually, he had Lily,
 who was quite a dish.


  So, do you, uh,
 find me attractive?
  Sorry, but no.


  Oh, curse the luck!
  And this is an android
  that I programmed to say
 nothing but "yes.

"
  (electronic whooshing)
  Why? Why? Why?
  What am I over-look-ing?
  Uh, Professor
 don't be offended.


  Do you think it might
 be your voice?
  Why, what's wrong
 with my voice,
  with the up and down
 and the extra words
  and the terminal nonsense
 in the hoyven clyven wayen.


  Oh, my God, it's the voice.


  Duh.


  MARGE:
 Hello.


  We're here to see Abe Simpson.


  I brought him a homemade card!
  I brought me.


 That's enough.


  Oh what the?
 (woman humming)
  Gee, I thought they'd
 be over this by now.


  (humming)
  Wow, they are really out of it.


  There must be some way
 to take advantage of them.


  You're telling me!
  Eh.


  This little device,
 which fits under the tongue,
  will change everything.


  (deep, sexy voice): This voice is
 an amalgam of great voices
  (like Clark Gable):
 from Clark Gable
  (like Walter Cronkite):
 to Walter Cronkite
  (like Rush Limbaugh):
 to Rush Limbaugh!
  (deep, sexy voice):
 I don't agree with his politics,
  but his body
 is a natural echo chamber.


  Wow.

 That does
 change everything.


  You turned me on.


  Oh, it's time for
 a little field test, I see.


  Any other advice, Homer?
  Yep-- hang out
 at yoga classes.


  That's where
 the ladies are.


  (normal voice): How would
 you know about yoga class?
  Uh, I thought
 it was yogurt class.


  Twenty-one!
 Dealer wins again.


  Now, here's
 our headliner, Dolly Parton.


  (banjo plays)
  Oh, she's good.


  Bart!
  Ay, caramba!
  You're taking advantage
 of these people
  who don't know
 where they are.


  I'm taking them back
 where they belong.


  Oh, no, you don't.


  He just comped me a suite!
  Fantastic!
  (clattering, thud)
  (meows)
  (gasps)
  You can't keep
 pumping powerful drugs
  into people who can't
 even bite into a peach.


  Mrs.

 Simpson,
 it's a fact.


  If these seniors
 aren't medicated,
  I can't binge-watch
 Boardwalk Empire.


  Nucky dies at the end!
  Yeah, well, screw you.


  I'm going to report you
 to the state.


  I really don't care.


  (groans)
  Wha?
  You broke me.


  I'm going to say something
 I've never said.


  How can I help you?
  Um, I'll wait outside
  'cause they might
 make me do something.


  I've changed my height,
 I've changed my eyes,
  my relationship status--
  I-I don't know why I put
 "unavailable" there.


  That certainly
 did not help matters.


  But now it is time
 to change my voice
  (clears throat):
 Oyce Voy
  (deep, sexy voice):
 And the hoyvin and the flayvin
  are now "hasta
 la vista, Frinky.

"
  Ooh.


 (hums)
  Mm
  (chuckles softly)
  (scoffs)
 I'm always next to the jerk
  who comes here
 to meet women.


  Hey, look, I get you.


  You broke up with a long-
 time high school boyfriend
  'cause he just wasn't
 going anywhere.


  Then you play the field,
 but it's all losers
  who just want
 to take from you.


  Now you're just
 hoping beyond hope
  for a man you can hug
  who'll organize
 the wires behind your TV.


  And believe you me,
 sweetheart,
  I can organize every
 wire you have.


  Now I'd like to show you
 a picture of my new puppy.


  Yeah, his name's
 (sneezes)
  (normal voice):
 Logarithm.


  (clears throat)
  (deep, sexy voice):
 I mean Larry.


  Aw
 Here's my number.


  And to prove
 it's not a lie
  (cell phone ringing)
  Yeah, baby.


  (both giggling)
  Call me!
  Man, you're reading
 page three
  and the next
 thing you know,
  you're finishing
 the last article, hmm.


  (normal voice):
 I got all their numbers!
  Boy, you are smooth.


  Carl smooth.


  Now I'd better
 get home.


  And in case Marge is mad,
 can I borrow that chip?
  Oh, sure thing, pal.


 I have extras.


  (sniffing)
  (low voice):
 Chitter, chitter, baby.


  (chittering)
  I was so worried.


  Where have you been?
  No, don't tell me.


  I don't want to hear
 one of your stupid lies.


  (deep voice):
 Marge, my dear,
  you are the pork chop
 with gravy on top.


  And I'm the applesauce that
 brings out your flavor.


  Oh, Homie.


  (Homer coughs)
  (deep voice):
 What the hell was that?
  (normal voice):
 What the?
  You're not my wife.


  Which I find intriguing.


  Suit yourself.


 (laughs)
  So, Professor, tell me
 all about last night.


  Dish-dish-dish!
  Uh, yes, well, I can't talk now.


 I'm on a date.


  And then I have a date.


  And then another date.


  Is there such a thing as too
 much of a good thing?
  This is my cousin,
 Nookie Kwan.


  I'm number one on the east side.


  (quietly):
 Oh, gah-layvin.


  Have any of you seen John Frink?
  He ain't here.


  But his hover-tronic
  Frink-a-ma-car
 is parked outside.


  Hey, if I say he ain't
 here, he ain't here.


  Hey, Moe, there's
 a rat floating in my beer.


  It ain't there.


  (door closes)
  Thank you,
 my good man,
  but, uh, I saw some
 terrible things down there.


  Like for one,
 Moe is pantsless.


  Hey, it's apron-only Tuesday.


  Oi
  You're a lucky
 guy, Frinky.


  Got all the chicks
 you want
  while I can't find
 a single woman
  to put up with me and my
 domesticated wolverine.


  Lucky Frink.


 I got nothin'.


  Some guys get
 all the breaks.


  Let me see here.


  Uh, needy men
  plus lonely women
  I-I just bring them together!
  Hey, that's some
 nice thinkin' there.


  Now, how 'bout a beer
 and a baked potato.


  Ah, that sounds nice.


  We don't serve
 baked potatoes.


  What happened?
  Everyone is incredibly
 depressed.


  (groans)
  (sighs)
  (electronic sigh)
  I admit the hallucinations
 were getting out of hand,
  so I stopped the meds.


  And hid them in the one place
 they'll never look: the library.


  Well, there's one thing you
 didn't count on--
  I go there because it's the only
 room in this building with heat.


  (Marge gasps)
  Grampa, you're not allowed
 to take dangerous drugs
  unless they're in
 a little paper cup.


  Listen here.


  Every night I watch my roommate
 cry himself to sleep.


  Yesterday I found out
 it was a mirror!
  I'm gonna find my Mona!
  (grunting)
  There's a lesson here--
 never visit Grampa.


  (gasps)
  My old car.


  Oh, that's some fine
 hallucinatin'.


  To the good ol' days
 before polio was cured!
    Hot diggity!
  It's America the way I liked it,
  before we went to the moon and
 discovered how boring it was.


  (laughing)
  I found the one happy moment
 in 80 years of life
  and I ain't leavin' it.


  Oh, this ain't right.


  (snaps)
  That's better!
  This ends right now!
  She's not real.


 None of this is real.


  Imaginary cigarettes?
 Nonexistent candy?
  (stammering)
  Get outta here, Marge!
  Unescorted women like you
 aren't allowed in this era!
  I'm not getting out,
 I'm cutting in.


  You can't live here.


  You have people in the real
 world who love you.


  Two are standing
 right over here.


  If you live in the past,
 you'll never have us.


  And what's more precious to a
 grampa than his grandchildren?
  Particularly
 his grandson.


  Aw, your sexist argument
 has won me over.


  We women will have our day.


  Attaboy.


  (groans)
  Good-bye, Mona.


  And good-bye, pack of
 cigarettes for a quarter.


  I think I'll miss
 you the most.


  (gasps)
  So what, uh
  all that dancin' around
 with me meant nothin'?
  (chuckles): Oh, I'll be back
 to steal a kiss later.


  And as for you
  I've got more
 involved plans.


  (groans)
  So, Frink is finally going
 to announce which woman
  he's chosen to be with at
 the Springfield Planetarium.


  It's like an episode
 of The Bachelor,
  but you drive there and pay
 six dollars for parking.


  Why are we both explaining it
 if we all know what's happening?
  I like talking to you.


  (normal voice): Ladies,
 please pay attention here.


  (groaning, murmuring)
  You see, I, uh I thought I
 was the only one who was lonely.


  But I have learned
 that loneliness is everywhere,
  like superhero movies.


  How many times can Batman begin?
  I have reworked
 my algorithms
  to make you not like me,
  but to find the man that will
 make each of you happiest, yes.


  Uh, release the bachelors!
  I hope they enjoy it.


  (gasping)
  (impressed murmuring)
  Duffman would love
 to be taught
  how to speak
 in the first-person.


  (chuckling)
  Everyone's paired up.


  Almost everyone's
 paired up.


  Professor,
 what about you?
  Where's your match?
  For me, my true love
 is intellectual conquest,
  the-the music of the spheres.


  (owl hooting)
  Well, sometimes it's good
 just to be alone.


  And now the purple dusk
 of twilight time 
  Steals across the meadows
 of my heart 
  ("Stardust" continues)
  High up in the sky 
  The little stars climb 
  ELDERLY WOMAN: What are you doing
 with my daughter?!
  Why did I build a mother?
 Oi, goy-vick.


  Wait a minute, how come
 we're all back here?
  I flushed the rest of the pills
 down the toilet.


  Looks like they made their way
 to the reservoir.


  We should really try to wake up.


  Are you kidding?
 There's a full buffet
  and Dean Martin's here.


  Eh, that's
 right, pally.


  Here, try the shrimp.


  Some have gone bad,
 but, uh, most are fine.


  (slurps)
  @elderman
  Shh!
     


                





                    			1
 D'oh!

  (grunts)
  ANNOUNCER: It's fourth and nine
 for the Simpsons.


  Homer takes the snap,
 looking for a receiver.


  They're all covered.


  He's gonna sneak it in!
  (crowd cheering)
  Oh, man, that is why
 he gets to control the remote.


  The Simpsons 27x14 
 Gal of Constant Sorrow
  @elderman
  (Simpsons eating)
  Mmm.


 Oh, this tile is loose.


  I'll have to call a handy man.


  Why'd you say it like that?
  With a pause between the words.


 Are you saying I'm not handy?
  That's how you
 say it: handy man.


  It's handyman.


  That's what I said:
 handy man.


  (exclaims)
 Marjorie,
  there is the profession:
 handyman,
  and there are men who are handy.


  Which are you saying I'm not?
  Tell me.


  A handy
  man.


  (exclaims)
 Face it, homeboy,
  you ain't handy.


  Unless we need
 a big fat paperweight.


  I'll paperweight you!
  Oh! (groaning)
 (grunting)
  (grumbles)
 Homie, sweetie,
  replacing a tile
 is something
  you really need a
 professional for.


  I know how to replace a tile.


  All guys do.


  We talk about it all the time.


  Grout?
  There's no stopping
 what I've started here.


  Here's your tile.


 Have fun.


  Handy man.


  Lisa, honey, do you have any
 idea how to replace a floor?
  Here's a video tutorial
 on replacing a tile.


  I don't know if I need a
 whole tutorial to teach me
  You're tapping.

 You have to swipe.


 I'm-I'm swiping, I'm swiping.


  Pretend you're swiping
 chocolate icing off a cake.


  All right, how's that?
 Ah, see? There.


  There it is, yeah.

 Perfect.


 There really is icing on here.


  All right, then.


  Hi there.

 If you're
 watching this video,
  you've got a job
 that needs doing
  but you're too cheap
 to pay for it.


  Man, this guy's inside my head.


  Now, replacing a tile
 is a simple task.


  As long as the substrate
 beneath the tile isn't rotted.


  If there is rot
 in your substrate,
  we will now play loud music
 so you can curse.


  (salsa music playing,
 Homer shouting)
  Stupid floor! Why
  Why was I born a homeowner?
  On your marks.


 On your marks.


  Get set.


 Get set.


  Twins!
 Twins!
  Loser!
  Oh, boy.


  (Ralph giggling)
  Oh.

 Why is everyone passing us?
  You know how scared I am
 of going on a slant.


  Oh.


 (grunts)
  Ow!
  Latchkey kids rule!
  I can't die now.


  I actually did my homework.


  (grunts)
  (groans)
 I'm sorry, ma'am.


  Come spring, I'll go
 get that for you.


  Dang good-for-nothin' cart.


  Always fighting to go left
 when I wanted to go right.


  It was my only friend.


 (crying)
  Now take your sponge,
 wipe away the excess grout
  and you're done.


  Oh, my God,
  it looks like
 what it's supposed to look like.


  I did man work!
  My hero.


  I'm happy to say I was wrong.


  I'll put Maggie down
 and make you a snack.


  Something bacon-y.


  (whoops)
  A bacon apology sandwich.


  (meowing)
  What? No.


  No.

 No.


  (meow)
 (scratching)
  Oh, I sealed in the cat.


  If it dies,
 it'll stink up the whole house.


  Also, the kids like it.


  (meowing)
  Stupid genius cat.


  She went from under the floor
 to inside the wall.


  Here, kitty, kitty,
 kitty, kitty.


  MARGE:
 More repairs?
  Aah! Marge, I should
 tell you something.


  I knew it.


 You're not a handy
  No.

 You did not know it.


  I was going to say I'm not
 stopping with the tile.


  Oh, no.

 Once
 you've been bitten
  by the repair bug,
 you can't quit.


  How would you like hot water
 in the bathtub again?
  (gasps) I'll go get the "H" knob
 out of my jewelry box.


  Mmm.

 Don't take long,
 handy man.


  Handyman.


  (giggles)
  Okay, cat, I'll get you out
 tomorrow, but here's dinner.


  Lasagna, which I know cats like.


  Oh!
  Nothing to see here.


 Just kneeling
  in front of the
 electric outlet,
  appreciating Edison's miracle.


  Look, Hettie, you
 got two choices.


  Under the bed
 or in the closet.


  I suppose I will take
  the closet.


  Oh, my goodness.


 This is like my heyday
  when I was livin' in that car.


  You know, you get enough
 parking tickets on the front,
  they act like curtains.


  (sniffs)
 Mmm.


  Hey, mornin', boss.


  Hey, what you take
 in your coffee?
  'Cause I got sugar
 and I got something called
  "Not for individual sale.

"
  Listen.

 I don't think you should
 get too comfortable here.


  Okay, okay.


 Thought you might say that,
  but, uh, what if
 I make it amenable to you?
  If you hide me here,
 I'll give you a dollar a day.


  Here's one week in advance.


  Yes, I'm a slumlord.

  Working all night,
 traffic on the way home 
  And my uncle calling me
 like "Where ya at? 
  I gave you the keys,
 told you bring it right back" 
  I just-- I just think
 it's funny how it goes 
  Now I'm on the road,
 half a million for a show 
  And we started from the 
  Hmm.


  Sorry, cat.


 Had to go to work.


  Then there was a freeway chase
 on the news.


  Had to watch it till the end.


  The guy got arrested
 in a cul-de-sac.


  They never do
 what I yell at them to do.


  (meowing, scratching)
  Oh, you're in the ceiling?
  Do not use top step?
  Stupid government,
 trying to keep us down.


  (grunting)
  Where is Bart
 getting this money?
  (exclaims) Lisa?
  Just what do you
 think you're up to?
  Mm
  Come on.

 You can
 tell Dr.

 Tuna.


  Okay, I admit it.

 I think
 Bart's up to something funny,
  so I'm snooping in his room.


  No snooping.

 You know what
 they say about curiosity.


  It killed the cat?
 The cat's fine!
  Stop asking
 about the cat!
  MAN: Lose a Kewpie doll
 in front of your gal.


  (tuning guitar)
  Hey, boss.


 (clears throat)
  We have a situation here.


  You owe me three
 weeks' back rent.


  Aha!
  Bart Simpson,
 you are cruelly exploiting
  a poor,
 unfortunate woman.


  So, you're gonna tell Mom
 and she's gonna kick Hettie out.


  Girlie, ain't you got a heart?
  Nope.

 All brain,
 no heart.


  Yeah.

 She looks like
 a little bitty railroad bull.


  Now I got to sing for my supper.


  I wrote this one a few days ago.


  This is a song about loss.


  It was a cart 
  Meant for shopping 
  It came to mean 
  Much more to me 
  It held the pan 
  I cook my slop in 
  And my old PlayStation 3 
  It was my home 
  And my place of worship 
  It was my home 
  And it was kinda my car 
  Now you're just rolling
 underwater 
  While Safeway wonders 
  Where you are.

 
  Whoa! My roommate
 is talented!
  If I know
 my Smithsonian Folkways,
  that was
 an Appalachian folk song.


  Well, I'm from
 Lickskillet, Kentucky,
  just shy of the
 Appalachia Trail.


  Really? Oh, I love, love, love
 indigenous mountain music.


  (chuckles)
 Well, isn't that fascinatin'?
  I'm glad you
 liked the song.


  Yes.

 I liked it
 very, very, very m
  Oh! You want money.


  I'm sorry.

 I don't have any.


 (chuckles)
  I'm also a musician.


  (chuckles)
 But you can stay in our house.


  Ha-ha! It's a deal!
 Back in the boy's closet.


  No, Hettie.


 You're a human being.


  You can sleep in my closet.


  Hmm.

 Well, la-di-da.


  How much you charge?
  Nothing.

 Maybe we can talk
 a little music.


  Ugh.

 Boy, what's
 your price again?
  Okay, we'll only talk about it
 if you want to!
  But it would be an honor.


  Okay, let's go.


  Oh, you've hurt
 yourself.


  Uh, nope, that's syrup.


  Oh, let me find you
 a Wet-Nap.


  I just woke up
 from a wet nap.


  Okay.


 Conversation's over.


  Check, one, two.


  All right.


  No, no, no, leave
 the windows open.


  I like crickets and
 night breeze in my music.


  They do go well together.


 Have you always been musical?
  You know, first sound I ever
 heard was my daddy fiddlin'.


  His name was Bascom Lee Boggs.


  (gasps)
 Bascom Lee Boggs?!
  He played with
 some seminal Appalachian bands,
  like Snug
 and the Cousin Huggers,
  Lead Paint Larry
 and the Drooly Boys,
  Howlin' Sue
 and Her Vestigial Organ,
  and Bloody Mary
 and the Coalmine Canaries.


  (inhales) Did your daddy
 teach you to fiddle?
  No.


  He was gonna start me out
 on the cigar box banjo,
  but, uh, before he could,
 he-he lost his sight.


  Oh, no.

 I'm sorry.


  Yeah, he got shot
 in the face.


  (gasps) You know them puzzles
 where you slide the tiles?
  He looks a little
 like that now.


  My mother was an amazing
 banjo player.

 Mmm.


  Unfortunately, she did also go blind.


 Really?
  Yeah, it was winter
 and she was runnin' a fever
  and, um, then she got shot
 in the face.


  Oh, wow.

 Hettie,
 you've had such a sad life.


  But you know what?
 That's gonna turn around
  when I show the world
 what it's missing in you.


  Well, I don't know if
 the world's gonna get me,
  but, child, it sure feels
 good to know that you do.


  Mmm.


 Mmm.


  You're having a moment
 with someone
  who has so few moments.


  This will never be forgotten.


  Oh, baby girl, I feel like I'm
 back home in poorest Appalachia.


  Thank you.


  Okay.

 And three, two, one
  (playing guitar)
  Oh, Barnes &amp; Noble 
  Oh, I am sorry to see 
  That your store 
  Has been shuttered 
  I miss your
 bathroom policy 
  I would sleep
 in your stalls 
  For many a long day 
  It's lovely,
 but I want you to know
  I've-I've truly come
 to hate music.


  That is so sad.


  I wanted to arrange a concert
 in Springfield Park.


  We needed the school's lights
 and sound system.


  Lights? Sweetie, you don't know
 a Fresnel from a gobo.


  Well, I think you'll help me
 every way you can.


  And why, pray tell, is that?
  Because deep down, there's
 still a part of you
  that remembers music
 can be magical.


  (chuckles)
 You're right.


  I can't bear
 to kill your passion.


  It will live at least
 until third grade,
  when you get Mrs.

 Ortner.


  So, I got back together
 with Jeff.


  Then, of course, I realized
 there was a reason we broke up.


  (playing tuba)
  That sounds awful,
 and you look stupid doing it.


  (guitar playing)
  (grumbling)
  (knocking)
  Hettie, Hettie, I have
 a surprise for you!
  (gasps) Oh, well,
 barbecue my bedbugs.


  That is glorious.


  (chuckles) To pay for it,
 I sold my Malibu Stacys.


  Which, from a feminist
 perspective, was long overdue.


  But I have a Ken that I'm
 transitioning to a Stacy.


  Try it on, try it on,
 try it on!
  I heard you the second time!
  Mmm, mmm.

 Why,
 thank you, Your Majesty,
  I will have
 another cup of soda.


  Lis, Lis, Lis.


 (grunting) What?!
  I've seen you like this
 before, and it ends badly.


  She is gonna
 break your heart.


  And your heart's as
 tough as a soap bubble.


  Remember how upset you got
 over that dead plant?
  Oh.

 It's the seven-month
 anniversary of that.


  (crying)
  Oh, geez, here
 we go again.


  Ugh.

 You know what, Bart?
 Just get out!
  And get Dad's keys and
 drive us to the radio station.


  And then get out!
 Wait until we're done.


  Then drive us back.


 Then get out!
  (hammering, sawing)
  (crash)
 HOMER: Damn it!
  (knocking)
 (footsteps approaching)
  Hey.


  Hello, Homer.


 I need to do the laundry.


  Uh, uh, I'll do it!
 Oh.


  HOMER: You idiot.

 Now we'll always
 have to do the laundry!
  (laughs)
  I'll do it wrong
 so she'll never ask again.


  Homer, you're a genius!
  Thanks, brain!
  Oh, I'm not your brain.


 I'm a blood clot.


  Okay.

 I'm goin' in.


  Thank God I never put in
 that insulation.


  (grunting)
  Whoo-hoo!
  I glide silently
 through the wall.


  Silently, ever silently.


  (Snowball II mewing)
  (grunting)
  Aah! Ooh, rogue nails! Oh.


  (hissing)
 Hot pipe!
  (panting)
  Gah.

 It's Oh.


  Rough tongue! Aah!
  Oh, that's just
  (Santa's Little Helper howling)
  Aw, crap.


  (barking)
  Sure am glad
 we don't have a horse.


    Welcome back to Mountain Trax.


  I'm here today with the one
 and only Miss Hettie Mae Boggs,
  the baby of the Boggs Family.


  (laughing): Well, I'm a little big
 for a baby.


  Although my mother did have
 a 21-pounder.


  Charming.


 Does anyone on this station talk
  like they're not at a funeral?
  No.

 I'm afraid we all do.


  So, Hettie, you're doing
 a concert tonight.


  Yes, she is.


  Could you tell our listeners
  why you didn't perform with your
 older brothers and sisters?
  I mean, they would ask
 me to.

 They would
  They'd say,
 "Hettie, come over here,
  pick up a banjo
 and play a song with us.

"
  And, um, I don't know.


  I'd say, "No, I'm happy just
 to sit down by the creek
  and do my heroin.

" You know?
  Wait.

 What?
  Is it also true
 you've been discovered by,
  and then turned your back on,
  well-meaning supporters
 time and time again?
  Uh, yes, yeah,
 that is a pattern I adhere to,
  and do you have any OxyContin?
  Now, if you got some,
 you don't have to say yes.


  You just got to blink.


  Maybe we should take a break.


  For the record,
 I'm not blinking.


  He's holding.

 He
 just won't share.


  No, no, Hettie, please tell me
 that you're rehabilitated.


  Please tell me that
 you're talking about heroin
  so that no one else will follow
 in your footsteps.


  Please reassure me
 because I am frightened.


  Oh, baby girl, I
 wouldn't let you down.


  You and me-- we get
 each other, yeah?
  But if I don't get
 something sweet,
  I might shoot someone in the face.


 (gasps)
  Are you saying that you shot
 your parents in the face?
  I don't know.


  That's not really the
 kind of thing you remember.


  You know what I mean?
  All right,
 I'm gonna go now.

 Bye.


  Lis, if she shoots
 your face off tomorrow,
  just remember
 this is what it looks like.


  (high-pitched squeak)
  She is not going
 to let me down!
  She is not!
  I am saving her.


  Okay, you've convinced me.


  You're out of your mind.


  So, how'd it go at the co-ed
 kickball championship?
  All a lie!
  Lisa's been hiding a dangerous
 heroin addict in her closet!
  (gasps) You were hiding her
 in your closet, too!
  I was renting
 week-to-week!
  (grumbling) Homer, do you know what
 was going on in our house?
  Why are you asking meow--
 I mean, me now?
  Homer, I know about the cat.


  I also know about the dog.


 He's fine.


  (whistles)
 (panting)
  I've been taking care of everything.


 You knew?
  It was pretty sexy
 pretending you were toolsy.


  But Lisa let a strange
 Kentucky lady live in our house
  without our permission.


  Well, now I don't know where
 she is, and I believed in her,
  and we have a concert
 in 30 minutes.


  Oh, honey, we'll find her.


  You entertain the audience
 till we get there.


  Okay, I'll play my sax!
  Well, that'll turn
 a disappointed crowd
  into a lynch mob.


  Shut up.


  Okay, if you want
 to find this woman,
  and I recommend you don't,
 here's a little clue.


  Hettie usually smells
 like radiator booze.


  To Cletus country!
    Hettie, we need
 to get you up,
  run you through a car wash
 and get you to that concert.


  You hush up now!
  Fortunately for you,
 I'm fluent in drunk.


  (slurring his words):
 Now, come on, get up.


  (speaking gibberish)
  You're gonna
 get up and
  (both speaking gibberish)
  And backtalk.


  (both speaking gibberish)
  Nobody tell me what to do.


  Not you, not the po-lice.


  Not even the police.


  Cletus, why did you
 give her a shotgun?
  Hey, I do not give
 anyone firearms.


  Now, she must've taken that
 out the umbrella stand.


  Oh, your little girl's
 been so good to me.


  I can't shoot you
 in the face.


  I'll just make you deaf
 for a week.


  Oh! I have church tomorrow.


  Can you do the other?
  Thank you!
  (playing lively jazz)
  Give it up!
 She isn't coming!
  (song ends)
  You've just made
 a very powerful enemy-- NPR.


  Our revenge is made possible
 by listeners like you.


  Hello, Springfield!
  They're gone, and I am never,
 ever gonna forgive you.


  As I went down
 in the river to pray 
  Slipped in the mud
 and lost my way 
  Found a bag of chips
 and half a Twix 
  Thank you, Lord,
 for this day 
  Oh, honey, I've been down 
  Bread bag shoes
 and a Burger King crown 
  Oh, honey, I've been down 
  And down is where
 I think I'm gonna stay.

 
  (crying)
  Ugh.

 Okay, you can sleep
 it off on our couch.


  Well, thank you, sweetheart.


  Hey, what time do you
 do your couch gags?
  Around 11:00 in the
 morning.

 You'll be fine.

 indoor water park.


  Hopefully, this will put the
 final nail in the coffin
  of lakes and rivers.


  Well, as a mother, I
  We all know
 you're a mother.


  As a mother,
 I like that wherever I look,
  I can see a lifeguard.


  I'm finding Nemo!

 Hmm.


  I'm afraid you're going
 in the kiddie pool.


  Oh.

 I've had baths
 that were more exciting.

 Baths!
  (kids gasping happily)
  Oh, my God, a plastic ring.


  Out of my way,
 you little twerps!
  I want that ring.


  (grunting)
 Ow!
  Hmm.


  Hey, uh, do you have
 any waterslides
  for the gentleman of
 leisurely proportions?
  Right this way, sir.


  This park specializes
 in extra-wide
  double-reinforced tubing
 for the modern American fatso.


  (chuckles):
 Oh, well.


  Cola wars veteran
 coming through!
  Woo-hoo! I'm exercising!
  (laughing)
  (mechanical bear roars)
  (gunshot)
  Awesome.


  Milhouse, how long
 you been waiting in line?
  You mean you didn't
 use the app last week
  to get your Slammin' Salmon
 line number?
  What are you, Amish?
  (groans)
  All right,
 time to thin out the herd.


  (grunting softly)
  (static crackles)
  (deep voice, over P.

):
 Attention, bathers,
  this is water park president
 Cal A.

 Bunga.


  Do not panic,
 but the pools are infested
  with those tiny fish
 that swim up your wiener.


  Get out of the way!
 (crowd clamoring, screaming)
  Again, do not panic.


  If you think a wiener fish
 has entered your dingus,
  the only cure is to roll around
 naked in the snow.


  (clamoring)
  (people gasping, groaning)
  Uh, Lou, I need a
 big favor from you.


  Oh, man.

 I They don't train
 you for this at the academy.


  Well, they should.

  Oh, dear God!

  (shrieks)
  (gasps)
 That poor raccoon!
  Isn't anyone gonna do anything?
  He committed nature's greatest
 crime: coming inside.


  (grunting)
  No heartbeat.


  Finally, a chance to use
 my online CPR training.


  (whispering):
 One, two, three, four five.


  (blows)
  One, two, three, four, five.


  (blows)
  (singsongy):
 Lisa has a boyfriend!
  Lisa has a boyfriend!
  Oh, a boyfriend?
  And raccoons
 are such good providers.


  Come on, come on.


  You have so much more trash
 to eat.


  Steal one more breath,
 noble bandit.

 (grunts)
  (coughs)
  It worked.

 I saved you.


  (chitters)
  (sighs)
 My first rescue.


  And my first real kiss.


  She'd have chosen me if I was
 wearing a real bathing suit.


  (groans)
  For once, a life saved
 at a Springfield water park,
  where a quick-thinking
 second grader
  performed emergency CPR
 on a drowning nuisance animal,
  while dozens of unheroic
 onlookers just stood around.


  Where was Channel Six news?
  Filming gas pumps
 and their ever-changing prices.


  Which accomplishes what?
 I don't know.


  DIRECTOR:
 There's eight minutes left.


  Uh, did we do gas prices?
  Yes!
  (Ralph giggles)
  We saw you
 on the picture radio.


  They chyroned
 your name.


  They described you
 as "Local Girl.

"
  Hubba, hubba.


  They sure got that
 right.

 (growls)
  Lisa, it looks like you're the
 perfect student to look after
  Nibbles the hamster here
 during spring break.


  I'd take him with me,
  but I'm doing Jell-O shots
 with former students.


  This spring break, I'm gonna
 go wild with responsibility!
  My dad's spending spring break
 in a cage, too.


  And for saving that raccoon,
 I got the opposite of teasing.


  I bet the Germans
 have a word for it, like, uh,
  gerstronkenplatzen
 or something.

 (chuckles)
  I wish the Germans had a word
 for this terrible traffic.


  And so ends the moment
 being about me.


  What's going on, Chief?
  Oh, nasty car crash.


  Can't let traffic through
  until the cleanup crew
 mops up this mess.


  Which is a problem,
  because they're
 stuck in traffic behind you.


  Okay, who did that?!
  We need to get home.


  I left my father-in-law
 on the sofa.


  He's got to be turned.


  Yeah, well,
 that ain't gonna happen.


  Not unless you clean up
 this accident scene.

 (chuckles)
  Actually, seriously,
 could you do that?
  Hmm, I don't know.


  I'm one of those people
 who doesn't like
  being traumatized
 by horrifying sights.


  Marge, do you know why
 I became a cop?
  If you do, could you tell me?
  'Cause it's-it's
 really dangerous.


  B-But these crime scene
 cleanups, they're totally safe.


  All the bad people are dead
 or, uh, at large.


  So give it a shot.


  Please.

 Please, Mom.


  Huh?
  Oh, all right.


  There you go.


 Spick and span.


  Wow, you even made the
 homeless guy look nice.


  Yeah, still crazy though.


  You know, Marge,
 uh, you ever want
  some fast extra
 cash, we are always
  looking for crime
 scene cleaner-uppers.


  You know what they say:
 crime always pays.


  Plus, you can keep
 any money you find,
  and any jewelry that
 isn't monogrammed.


  (bicycle bell dings)
  Hello, little girl.


  Oh, does your hamster
 have Tyzzer's disease?
  That would've
 been interesting,
  but I swabbed him for Tyzzer's
 and it came up negative.


  My.

 You certainly
 know a lot about animals.


  That's just it, I do.


  I saved a raccoon's
 life the other day.


  It was the best
 feeling I've ever had.


  Is there any way I could
 work in your office?
  I mean, as an
 intern or anything?
  Oh, do you know how many people
 walk in here every day
  looking for just such a thing?
  A lot, I bet.


  No, it's never happened.


  Grab a clean smock
 and follow me.


  Oh, okay!
 (giggles)
  I can't find a clean smock.


  Then your first job is
 to clean the smocks.


  (bell dings)
  I'm ready, Dr.

 Budgie.


  Oh, it's a shame to ruin
 such a clean smock,
  but, uh, let's go.


  Hmm.


  (squeals)
  (sputters)
  This is heaven.


  You got to help me, Doc.


  My pet ferret
 has lost its terrible stink!
  Well, that won't do.


  Let me have a go
 at jump-starting
  the old stink gland.


  Lisa, my dear,
 can you restrain the ferret?
  It would be my honor.


  Clear!
  (electrical buzz)
  We have stink lines!
  Well done, Lisa.


  Heaven!
  (chuckles) Ew.


  All right,
 Veggie Kibble for Daisy here.


  Chairman Meow
 is having surgery tomorrow,
  so only liquid for you.


  And no more food for you,
 Mr.

 Snake,
  until you finish
 shedding your skin.


  Oh.

 You have.


  Dr.

 Budgie, I'm really enjoying
 cleaning out these cages.


  No, really, I am, but are there
 any jobs that are more exciting?
  Absolutely.


  You can hobble
 these crickets.


  We have a hungry chameleon
 who's slowing down with age,
  but he still loves
 the thrill of the hunt.


  Mm.


 Anything more life or deathy?
  I could take
 the animals' temperature.


  I know what that means,
 and I am up for it.


  Oh, Lisa, slow down.


  Do you know how many awkward
 courses I had to take
  before they let me put
 my arm inside a horse?
  I understand.


  I just feel like
 I could be doing more.


  Oh, you remind me
 of a certain young man
  growing up in
 Stratfordshire-on-Corningwell.


  He, too, was impatient.


  Always thinking
 he could do more.


  Was that you?
  No.

 If that was me,
 I would have said "me.

 this is Marge Simpson.


  I think I'd like to do some of
 those crime scene cleanups.


  Oh, great, great.


  Hey, I got a job for you
 right here.


  Uh, murder-suicide.


  Or possibly a suicide-murder.


  Just bring a mop
 and your imagination.


  Hey, it can't be worse
 than what I've seen.


  Homer, I told you not to eat
 chili out of the colander!
  Uh, it's pronounced
 "calendar.

"
  What's the matter, little guy?
  You haven't touched
 your berries.


  Do you need aphids for flavor?
  Mmm.

 Aphids.


  DR.

 BUDGIE: Lisa, could you
 come here for a moment?
  (gasps)
 At last.


  I'm trying to give this
 Saint Bernard a shot,
  but my hands are
 a little shaky.


  I had an extra gallon
 of tea for lunch.


  Oh, my.


  If I hold him,
 do you think
  you could attend to the
 matter of the needle?
  Of course!
  Mm.


  Careful, careful.


  A single millimeter
 either way
  would not make much
 of a difference.


  LISA:
 Huh.

 Why am I not feeling
  the same rush I did
 with the raccoon?
  (barking)
  (shudders)
 There it is!
  (humming)
 Be careful, Mrs.

 S.


  I've never seen an angel-dust-
 for-guns swap go so wrong.


  Hey, a mess is a mess.


  Huh?
  Let me start with this
 filthy crime scene tape.


  (humming)
  Yarr, is the
 doctor in, miss?
  Little Goldie here is
 listing hard to starboard.


  I fear he may have tangled
 with the wrong plastic diver.


  Hmm.

 Could be fin rot.


  Oh, no, not the
 big F.

 Arr!
  Do what you must.


 I'll say my good-byes.


  You were more wife to me
 than any woman I ever knew.


  Captain, the diagnosis
 of fin rot
  is not the death sentence
 it used to be.


  A couple drops of medicine
 in the water, and he'll be fine.


  Hmm.


  Yarr, that's amazing!
  Eh, I've just got one
 more little problem.


  He, uh
 he ate me car keys.

 Yarr.


  (grunting)
  Hurry, Doc! His lungs
 are full of seltzer!
  (sobbing)
  (grunting)
  (chattering)
  (grunts)
  Homie?
 Notice anything?
  (beeping)
  (alarm beeping)
  Um, are you having an affair?
  What? No.


  I bought
 a new ceiling fan.

 Huh?
  Ooh, I thought the air
 felt a little more lively.


  But where did you
 get the money?
  Actually, I made a little extra
 by cleaning up crime scenes.


  What? Poor Marge.


  I heard
 that can really mess you
  Oh, baby,
 that cool air is sweet!
  up.


  Are you sure you're not
 living a waking nightmare?
  No.

 Not one little bit.


  And I get the police discount
 on cleaning supplies.


  I can finally clean
 Grampa's dentures.


  Yeah, I got popcorn in there
 from Kramer vs.

 Kramer.


  I was rooting
 for Kramer,
  but was dismayed when
 Kramer finally won.


  That's a twist I
 didn't see Kramer.


  Happy birthday, Martin.


 Where's the gift table?
  (chuckles)
 Right over there, my friend.


  (humming)
  Haw-haw!
  (chicken clucking)
  (giggles)
  Some zoo.


 Where are the rental strollers?
  Actually, it's
 not so bad.


  The animals are healthy.


  A couple of paddock scrapes,
 but nothing overly concerning.


  Oh, knock it off.


 You're not a vet.


  You're a glorified
 cage scrubber.


  Dr.

 Budgie
 depends upon me!
  I have felt the cold breath
 of kennel cough in my face.


  I have seen tabbies that
 were more tick than cat.


  I know why the
 caged dog scoots.


  So when your lizard
 loses its tail,
  you're gonna need me to tell
 you it's gonna grow back.


  (sighs)
  Want some peanuts,
 Mr.

 Elephant?
  Uh, it's a goat,
 not an elephant,
  and those are shrimp,
 not peanuts.


  And that goat is
 allergic to shrimp!
  Your breath smells like
 "don't drink that.

"
  (worried bleat)
  Milhouse, give me your EpiPen!
  You're not
 a professional.


  I am a self-selected
 unpaid veterinary intern.


  Now let me
 practice my craft!
  (bleating excitedly)
  Hey, he's as
 good as new.


  Look at him play
 with the kids!
  (kids grunting)
  See, Bart?
 Life or death.


  I make the choice.


  Okay, time to
 cut the cake.


  (bleats triumphantly)
  That's my patient.


  Guess what, sweetie.


  I'm wearing
 my snuggle socks.


  They're compression socks
 from your heart surgery.


  All the same
  (purring)
  (sighs)
  I'm not in the mood.


  What?!
 You've never said that before!
  I've thought it
 three times.


  Each time was after a
 burrito-eating contest.


  But I won!
  What's wrong?
  It's just that seeing
 you, lying down,
  reminds me of this bloated
 corpse I had to clean up today.


  Hey, I look damn good for
 someone who eats the crap I do.


  Maybe we should
 just go to sleep.


  I wasn't done
 with my drink.


  Would you like
 my itty-bitty booze light?
  I've never seen him like this.


 He's so listless.


  Who's lost the urge
 to kill?
  Who's lost
 the urge to kill?
  I'll tell you what's
 wrong with him: you.


  What? Me?!
  This dog is badly
 behind on his shots.


  He's displaying the symptoms
 of early onset parvo.


  I'm confiscating
 your dog.


  And, you, get out!
  Smithers, I've
 been shamed.


  Prepare a thimble of ice cream.


  Some people don't
 deserve to own pets.


  BART:
 And you get to decide who?
  Don't fold your
 arms at me.


  Lis, look at yourself.


  You've become so arrogant,
 you've forgotten who you are.


  And even worse,
 you've forgotten Nibbles!
  (gasps) Nibbles!
  My pet! My responsibility!
  My homework!
  (gasps)
  Matted hair, dry tongue
  Is this true, Lisa?
  Did you let this happen
 to a creature in your care?
  I'm so sorry.


  I'm so, so sorry.


  Pet hamsters need to be
 played with regularly,
  or they feel abandoned.


  And that can lead to
 stress polyps on the heart.


  The heart is the
 seat of love, Lisa.


  If you'd gone to veterinary
 school, you'd know that.


  I've got no choice
 but to operate.


  And I need your help.


  You still want me to help you
 after I was so arrogant?
  Lisa, arrogance is
 what made the British Empire.


  Then lost it.


  Then pretended it didn't happen.


  (monitor beeping steadily)
  Well, we've done
 all we can.


  The next 24 hours
 will be crucial.


  (monitor flatlining)
 Oh, he's gone.


  (crying):
 No, no, no.


  He can't be dead!
  He can't!
  I thought we could save every
 animal if we just cared enough.


  HOMER:
 Okay, Marge,
  sweetie, look at this one.


  See, Marge? The baby laughs
 every time the toaster pops.


  (chuckles)
 It is pretty hysterical.


  That's nice.


  Nice? Something in you
 is dead, Marge,
  and that's one crime scene
 you can't clean up.


  And all for a fan.


  A stupid ceiling fan that
  Oh, man, that's refreshing.


  I want my Marge back.


  (phone rings)
  Hello? What is it, boy?
  Uh-huh.

 I see.


  Fine, Marge.


  You sit here, watch your
 boob tube, have a beer.


  That's not how Homer Simpson
 does things.


  I have to go help Lisa!
  Lisa?
  Wait! Wait, I'm
 coming with you.


  (door closes)
  (phone ringing)
  (line ringing)
  No answer.


  I guess we got to
 do this ourselves.


  Oh, geez.


  All right, get some
 paper towels, boys.


  (chain saw buzzing)
  Lisa.


 (sniffling)
  Oh, Mom, he trusted me
 as only a hamster can!
  (crying)
  If there's one thing
 I'll always clean up,
  it's my baby's tears.


  Oh, I should've been
 here for you.


  You would've never let
 anything happen to him.


  I was too busy
 being dead inside
  Wherever he went,
 I hope they have hamster balls.


  doing I don't
 know what!
  But I'm here now,
 and I'll never leave.


  (chuckles)
  Well, I'll be.


  Lisa's learning about death
 helped Marge feel again.


  Yes, a perfect
 dovetail.


  Thank you for curing
 Walter Pigeon here.


  I can't afford to pay
 you, but I can give you
  front row seats
 to my magic show.


  The theme is boxing.


  Sounds marvelous.


  Oh, yeah, no.


 Come on, it is.


  I want to thank everyone
  for coming to
 Nibbles's funeral today.


  BART (over P.

A.

):
 This is President
  Cal A.

 Bunga.


  On this sad occasion,
  the school flag
 will be flying at half-ass.


  Bart! (groans)
  I know that this is
 an especially hard time
  for the other classroom pets,
  including Mrs.

 Nibbles,
 Shelly the turtle,
  Sally Mander, Hamilton Fish
 and Willie's chicken.


  Willie, where is
 your chicken?
  It was either him or me!
  I see.


  Please stand for
 Nibbles's final journey.

  Hey, Flanders.


  Gas up your leaf
 blower much?
  (gasps)
 Chickens?
  Since when do you
 have chickens?
  Oh, about six months.


  Well, they've been
 driving me crazy.


  Get rid of them.


 (chuckling): Oh.


  Don't let these feathery fellas
 ruffle your feathers, fella.


  Chickens.


  You have yourself a
 perfectly good coop,
  and that's what
 you keep in it?
  (whistles)
  Oh, Homer,
 surely you know
  there's nothing tastier
 than a fresh-laid egg.


  How do you want 'em, boys?
  BOTH (chanting):
 Coddled! Coddled! Coddled!
  (chuckles)
  What is it about boys
 and their coddled eggs?
  Hmm.


  Mm-hmm.


  Hmm?
  Whoa, so orange.


    I'm sorry, I
 can't eat these.


  Flanders has
 freshly-pooped eggs,
  orange as a sunset over
 a field of ripe Doritos,
  while these--
  look, I'm just gonna say
 what we're all thinking--
  store eggs are yellow.


  They're yellow eggs,
 Marge.

 Yellow.


  Why do you always think
 about what you don't have?
  Has anyone ever thought
 about what they do have?
  Have you?
 Not that much.


  Have you?
 Nope!
  Have you?
  Boy, I won't live long enough
 to teach you about sex,
  but I'll be damned if I don't
 show you how to steal eggs.


    Okay, son, stay
 sharp in there.


  If chickens are known
 for two things,
  it's bravery and
 intelligence.


  This is what we're after.


  (grunting)
  (chickens squawk)
 BART: I got one.


  Hurry, fat-ass!
  (both moaning)
  How can idiots say
 there's no God
  when a species that
 evolved from dinosaurs
  feeds us their
 unfertilized babies?
  Ugh, if I could lay
 eggs like these,
  I'd never leave
 my bedroom.


  (both grunt)
  (yips)
  (screams)
 The farmer!
  Homer Simpson, I am going
 to enjoy finding it in my heart
  to forgive you for this.


  (both groan)
  Well, there's no
 getting past that.


  We may not be able
 to steal Flanders' eggs,
  but we can steal his idea.


  You mean get our
 own chickens,
  feed them, love them
 and eat their eggs?
  Check.

 Mate.


  (squawking)
  (hammering)
  Urban poultry farming
 is a great way
  to reduce
 our carbon footprint.


  Or maybe increase it,
 I'm not sure.


  But they're so cute!
  Now, don't get attached.


  I'm about to cut them open
 to scoop out the eggs.


  No, look!
  They're already laying.


  Now, what lays bacon?
  One two eggs!
  (moaning)
 (moaning)
  Delicious.


 Delicious.


  (groans)
 These don't taste right.


  You're crazy, these are
 the best eggs I've ever eaten.


  No.


  No, something is missing.


  Hmm.


  (slurps)
  (gargles)
  (inhales)
  Hmm, Bart's right.


  They're not as good as the eggs
 we stole from Flanders.


  The eggs we stole
 from Flanders!
  You don't think they
 tasted so great
  because they were
 stolen, do you?
  Only one way to find out.


  (door opens)
 FLANDERS: My potato chips!
  Okay, first, a chip
 from the control bag.


  Now the stolen bag.


  (both moaning)
  It's true.


  Theft equals flavor.


  (Homer grunting)
 (Bart snickering)
  Ah, forget it.


  Just take 'em.


  You can't just
 give them to us!
  They only taste good
 if we steal them!
  Keep chasing!
  It improves
 the flavor!
  Sure, sure, whatever
 works for you.


  (Homer and Bart laughing)
  I guess we don't need
 our chickens anymore.


  Don't worry, I've already
 found a research facility
  that will raise them humanely.


  I wasn't worried
 about that.


    If you're going to eat the
 chickens, don't tell the girl.


  Oh, no, these chickens are here
 to advance the cause of science.


  (Simpsons oohing and ahing)
  HOMER: Look at
 all those lab coats.


  At Exploration
 Incorporated,
  our mission is to help humanity
 make the next big leap.


  That's so
 fascinating.


  When did you
 incorporate?
  We are preparing
 to launch
  the first privately-funded,
 manned mission to Mars.


  (gasps)
 You're going to Mars?
  That's incredible.


  Uh, yes.


  How do you plan to
 solve the problem
  of eyeball explosion when you
 take off your space helmet?
  Uh, you leave
 your helmet on.


  Hmm, these guys
 seem legit.


  This video will explain
 our revolutionary vision.


    NARRATOR:
 Human beings are explorers.


  It's what we do.


  It's who we are.


  But since our world holds
 no more secrets,
  we must journey to Mars.


  Government agencies like NASA
 say it will be decades
  before we set foot
 on the Red Planet.


  At Exploration Incorporated,
 we're working hard to establish
  a human settlement on Mars
 ten years from today.


  Soon a select group
 of colonists
  will leave Earth forever
  and become the first residents
 of another world.


  Will you be one of them?
  Exploration Incorporated.


  Never stop exploring.


  (gasps)
  HOMER:
 What about those Mars nutjobs?
  Who wants to take a one-way trip
 to a barren, lifeless rock?
  Yeah, in a couple
 years, we'll have
  a perfectly good barren,
 lifeless rock right here
  This guy gets it.


  Well, this mission
 really gives me hope.


  I'm tired of nothing but
 bad news about the future.


  Yes, but to travel
 to another planet,
  knowing you can
 never come back,
  you'd have to be
 pretty sad.


  Aniston sad.


  I'm not sad,
 I'm inspired.


  That's why I volunteered
 this afternoon.


  What?!
  The mission leaves
 in ten years.


  I'll be 18,
 and I'm going to Mars.


  No way, young lady.


  We cannot afford
 to send you to Mars.


  It's free.


  Cheaper than college.


  No.


 No!
  You volunteered to go to Mars
 and leave your family?
  Forever?
  This mission could
 save humanity.


  What if I was the first person
 to set foot on another world?
  I'd never be able to hug
 my daughter again.


  They thought of that.


  They give a virtual hug machine
 to every family back home.


  That does look
 pretty snuggly.


  (gasps)
 No!
  I think this could be
 my true purpose.


  Just let me try out.


  They might not even pick me.


  I mean, I'd pick me, but
  Absolutely not.


  You are grounded.


  You are confined
 to this planet.


  And its moon.


  (growling)
  HOMER:
 Uh, honey?
  A word before you
 continue parenting?
  What?
  In all my years of living
 with the female species,
  I've learned one thing.


  When they want to do
 something totally insane,
  your only move is
 to support them 100%.


  Oh, come on, that's ridiculous.


  Really? Have you ever
 done anything
  just because someone
 told you not to?
  You cannot marry
 Homer Simpson.


  I forbid it.


  Hmm.


  And now you got me.


  (humming)
  Oh, my gosh.


  We both know Lisa's
 not going to Mars.


  It's just a little
 girl's fantasy.


  But if you forbid someone
 from doing something,
  they'll want to do it more.


  So we should just
 pretend we're cool
  with our daughter
 abandoning us forever?
  Exactly.


  It's an old relationship move
 I call "turning into the skid.

"
  If you just play along,
  sooner or later Lisa will lose
 interest in her terrible idea.


  You haven't used
 that trick on me, have you?
  No, no.

 I learned it from
 observing other marriages.


  Ones less fantastic than ours.


  (garbage disposal whirs)
  Hmm, "turning into the skid.

"
  You know, I
 looked at a map,
  and Mars is just
 one planet over.


  If you really want to try out
 for this mission, I support you.


  Really? Thanks, Mom!
  If they choose me
 to be a colonist,
  I could make jazz
 the dominant music form
  of a whole new planet.


  That's exactly
 where jazz belongs.


  Way to turn into
 the skid, baby.


  Now watch Lisa lose
 interest in Mars,
  just as sure
 as you gave up
  on opening that
 G-rated comedy club.


  I thought Gentle Jollies
 was a great idea.


  Oh, not great.

 Amazing.


  Hmm, now that
 I think about it,
  that idea did have
 a lot of problems.


    Greetings, candidates.


  The testing that begins
 today will determine
  which of you have the necessary
 skills to thrive on Mars.


  Think of how satisfying
 it will feel
  to stand in the
 Valles Marineris
  and thunder-chug a Blue
 Bronco energy drink.


  I'm sorry, Blue Bronco?
 Wait, thunder-chug?
  Blue Bronco
 is just one
  of this mission's many
 corporate partners.


  Because this is a privately
 funded entrepreneurial mission,
  we've teamed up with some of
 America's most exciting brands.


  We're talking
 Mega-Charge Batteries,
  Fantasy-Lunatics.

com,
  Trudge-Rite
 Work Boots,
  Draft-Pigs.


  And who here likes Fig Glutens?
  (excited chattering)
  What? The fig seeds get
 caught in my adult braces.


  Oh, I should not have
 given away my dog, man.


  Oh, God.

 Oh, God.


 Oh, God.

 Oh, God.


  Oh, it's hurting my (gibbers)
  Oi! I can't feel my
 (gibbers)
  (chickens clucking)
  LISA:
 Principal Skinner?
  What brings you
 on this mission
  to make mankind
 a two-planet species?
  Mars is the ultimate field trip.


  And all they sell at
 the gift shop is immortality.


  Also, I'm drowning in debt.


  Well, I hope to establish a
 planet of perfect equality-ment.


  On Mars,
 you are my servant.


  Uh, well, well,
 either way is good, really.


  And then, finally,
  I got to spend some quality time
  with the oxygen reclaimers.


  You must've felt like
 the belle of the ball.


  You said if I supported
 Lisa's crazy idea,
  she'd lose interest.


  Oh, Marge.


  You'll never understand
 the female mind.


  We're just getting started.


  What more can we do?
  I've utilized my male mind
 to come up with
  a plan so supportive,
  Lisa will never want
 to do anything again.


    What are you guys doing here?
  We're trying out
 for Mars, too.


  We were so inspired
 by you being inspired.


  A family unit could be
 perfect for this mission.


  NASA would never
 have the guts
  to shoot a baby
 into space.


  And your father is
 a former astronaut.


  What an honor.


  Last time, I almost
 killed everybody.


  And what did you
 learn from that?
  Lessons, I guess.


  LISA:
 Okay.


  Mom, Dad and Bart
  don't want to go to Mars.


  So this must be some sort of
  mind-game reverse
 super-fake-out.


  HOMER:
 Poor Lisa.


  She is so faked out.


  LISA: And all I have to do
 is be patient.


  Pretty soon, they'll get
 sick of this and quit.


  HOMER:
 I'm getting sick of this.


  I think I'll quit soon.


  LISA:
 It's just a matter of time.


  HOMER: I wonder which one of these
 two guys is the one I quit to?
  PAUL:
 We will now test your ability
  to handle close confinement.


  For the next week,
  you'll be living in
 the Martian Habitat Simulator.


  I'll man this station.


  (zips door closed)
  (zips door open)
  (zips door closed)
  Okay, Mom.


  Since you're so
 excited to go to Mars,
  you'll be thrilled
 to start on
  the hab's daily
 maintenance procedures.


  "Nutrition Zone
 Sterilization Sequence.

"
  (gasps)
 That's just kitchen cleanup.


  Fun!
  No, no, no.


  Procedures aren't "fun.

"
  Sure, if you call them
 "procedures," they're a bore,
  but if you think
 of them as "chores,"
  they can be a blast!
  (grunts) They're not chores!
  They're science!
  Ooh, there's
 even directions
  on how to properly
 clean this binder.


  (humming happily)
  Oh, no.


  You cannot like this
 more than me.


  (both humming)
  (Lisa hums louder)
  Dinner is served!
  I rehydrated it with love.


  And recycled toilet water.


  (Homer and Bart moaning)
  So good, Marge!
  Well, today I tested nitrogen
 levels in our atmosphere.


  They were the same
 as yesterday.


  More toilet carrots, please!
  (annoyed groan)
  HOMER:
 Can't sleep.


  (grunting)
  My sleeping pod's too small.


  They have an expansion mode
  for morbidly obese astronauts.


  (grunts)
 Hmm.


  I know we're just here
 to fake-support our daughter,
  but you're pretty good
 at this space junk.


  Moms spend their whole lives
  obsessing over
 unlikely catastrophes.


  In space, that's what
 you're supposed to do.

  BARRY:
 The hab study is complete.


  To all the male participants,
  your monumental incompetence
  has sullied and
 cheapened space forever.


  Now get out.


  Good.

 It's a stupid idea
  and I hope everyone dies.


  HOMER: You're letting
 the Martians in!
  (Comic Book Guy exhales)
  BART: I'm keeping
 the jumpsuit.


  Marge and Lisa,
 congratulations.


  You've both passed
 with flying colors
  and will be named finalists
 in our astronaut search.


  Marge, you're a revelation.


  Most of our candidates are
 of the egghead loner variety.


  Bookworms, teacher's pets,
  friendless middle children,
 that sort of thing.


  (growls)
  But you display
 an amazing ability
  to perform repetitive tasks
 without getting bored.


  Even our robotic arm
 gets a little cranky.


  Ow!
  That's two, Lorraine!
  (whirs softly)
  May I talk to you
 in private, please?
  Admit it: the only reason
 you're here is to support me
  until I lose
 interest and quit.


  Well, I'm not going anywhere,
  so you can quit.


  Maybe I don't
 want to quit.


  Do you realize what a big deal
 it is to be a space colonist?
  Yes!
  That's why I want to do it!
  I think you don't like that
 I'm just as good at Mars as you.


  Maybe even better.


  Ha! Hardly.


  All you are is a
  a stay-at-hab space wife!
  Hmm.


  Well, it looks like
 the ego has landed.


  You're the last person
  I would ever want
 to go to Mars with.


  In ten years.


  That's too bad,
  because I'm
 going with you.


  In ten years.


  LISA: On Mars, that would
 be a door slam!
  Sometimes I feel like Lisa
 has no respect for me.


  I know, I know.


  I'm finally
 good at something
  and she has to make it
 into a competition.


  That must be
 really hard for you.


  It is.


  I'm so sorry you have
 to go through this.


  Thank you.


  Mom's always trying
 to hold me back!
  I know, I know.


  I can't be her
 little girl forever.


  That must be
 really hard for you.


  It is!
  I'm so sorry
 you have to go through this.


  Thank you.


  That listening-to-women junk
  you taught me really works.


  The trick is in the nodding.


  Dad, after seeing
 Mom and Lisa go at it,
  I'm glad our relationship
 is about physical abuse,
  not psychological.


  Me, too, boy.


  Aw.


  This press conference
 was originally scheduled
  to introduce our
 ten Mars mission finalists.


  However, our rivals
 at Space Colony One,
  a division of Pepperidge Farms,
  just announced that their Mars
 rocket is nearing completion.


  We made a solemn promise
 to Fig Glutens
  that they would be
 the first cookie on Mars.


  Therefore, we have moved up
 our launch date from 2026 to
  Thursday.


  (gasping)
  Thursday?
  This Thursday?
  Are you all ready
 to be a part of history?
  I wanted to be someone
  who's bravely going
 to Mars eventually.


  I haven't used
 my Open Table dining points!
  I'm still very much
 an alcoholic.


  Uh, I-I guess we
 should leave, too.


  I knew it!
 What?
  This has all been
 an elaborate charade.


  You never had the guts
 to go to Mars.


  Oh, I have the guts.


  I once went to a rock concert
 by myself in the rain.


  It was Loverboy.


  Then let's go.

 To Mars.


  Yeah, let's go!
  To Mars.


  Hmph.


 Hmph.

 in a week?
  Mom's my only
 good parent.


  And Lisa's my only good kid!
  Why won't they admit
  that neither of them
 actually wants to go to Mars?
  I'm not giving up yet.


  There's got to be a limit
 to their stubbornness, right?
  FLIGHT DIRECTOR:
 T-minus one minute to launch.


  HOMER:
 D'oh!
  Here we go! I guess.


  Yep.


  We're doing this,
 apparently.


  I'm sorry
 I doubted you, Mom.


  There's no one I would
 rather go to Mars with.


  I love you, sweetie.


  I love you, too.


  I don't want to go!
  This is the stupidest
 idea we ever had!
  Abort launch!
  That's a negative.


  I think you're forgetting
 the motto of Blue Bronco:
  "Let's do this thing.

  FLIGHT DIRECTOR:

  HOMER:
 This is not happening.


  Do you know how

  Of course not!

 Marge, no!
  FLIGHT DIRECTOR:

  It's not a real rocket.


  It's the outside
 of a real rocket.


  We did plan to build
 a real rocket.


  And that's one thing they can
 never take away from us.


  That plan is our legacy.


  Then why did you move up the
 launch if you knew it was fake?
  To inspire
 the next generation.


  And to provide a distraction
 while we drove away.


  Then why are
 you still here?
  Our car wouldn't start.


  Mom, doesn't it frighten you
  that we almost went to Mars
 out of sheer stubbornness?
  That's what a mother-daughter
 relationship is, sweetie.


  A series of near-fatal
 emotional standoffs.


  Okay, but it doesn't
 have to be that way.


  Surely we can
 learn from this.


  One day,
 we'll figure it out.


  On this planet or another.


    (chickens clucking)
  It's my life!
  If I want to leave Mars
  and move to Venus,
 you can't stop me!
  (annoyed grunt)
  Mom's always trying
 to hold me back.


  I know, I know.


  I can't be her
 little girl forever.


  That must be
 really hard for you.


  It is.


  Nod-Bot is so sorry you
 have to go through this.


  Thank you.

  BARRY: And that is
 racism's fatal flaw.

 actually, I didn't actually
  BARRY: They're good.


 They're really good.

  Burns 
  (gasps)
  (gasps)
  (sighs)
  (sobbing)
  Larry, Moe and Curly,
 get out here now!
  (Homer whooping)
  So, you like fun and games?
  Well, games can be fun, so, uh,
 that's kind of redundant.


  Would you like to
 rethink the question?
  (groans)
 Here's a game for you--
  properly stack
 and store those rods
  then perform
 a complete turbine
  maintenance procedure.


  Routine maintenance?
  We never do that.


  Lots of us never
 get to do things.


  Yeah, we know.


  We heard your song.


  (groans)
  (piano playing)
  Jacqueline Jones,
 reading for the part of Ilsa.


  Oh, I like this one.


  A cool girl.


  Plus her father
 owns a print shop.


  Free playbills.


  Four color.


  Yeah, yeah, smart.

 Yes.


  I can't fight it anymore.


  I ran away from you once.


  I can't do it again.


  Strange choices.


  Maybe that scrunchie's
 too tight.


  Well, you can
 teach acting.


  You can't teach popular.


  We've got our Ilsa.


  Are you sure?
 Even by school play standards,
  she's terrible.


  Skinner, I'm setting down
 my clipboard
  to signify that
 all future auditions
  are just a formality.


  Lisa Simpson,
 reading for the part of Ilsa.


  (groans) The egghead?
  Pass.

 Hard pass.


  (in accent):
 Can I tell you a story?
  It's about a girl who came
 to Paris and met a man,
  a very great and courageous man.


  She's good.


  Yes, better than
 Little Miss Print shop
  and there you are.


  Guess what, you've just
 been promoted a grade.


  (chuckles)
  Everything she knew
 or ever became
  was because of him,
  and she looked up to him
 and worshipped him
  with a feeling
 she supposed was love.


  (sighs)
  That's it!
  I'll audition for Rick.


  Co-stars are always
 falling in love:
  Brad and Angelina,
 Kermit and Miss Piggy,
  Mrs.

 Brady and Greg.


  The role of Ilsa
 goes to Lisa.


  (gasps)
 Yes!
  The role I was
 anagrammed to play.


  And since only one child
  auditioned
 for the lead role
  I am proud to announce
 Rick will be played by
  I'm looking for
 a down-on-his-luck heel
  named Skinner.


  (all gasp)
  (groans)
  (gasps, moans)
  Who are you?
  Name's Jack Deforest,
  and of all the schools
 in all the districts,
  I had to get transferred
 to this one.


  (clicks tongue)
  You've got the part.


  Well, that fills
 out the cast.


  Milhouse,
 you're the understudy.


  Understudy?
  Both those words are horrible.


  (bird screeches)
  Hey guys, my, uh,
 head's a little wet
  from the
 decontamination shower.


  Thanks.


 De nada.


  Let's see how
 that thing's working.


  (whirring)
  (all groan)
  Not again!
  Bring it back,
 get it working,
  screw it on tight.


  Both screws?
  SMITHERS: Yes.


 (door slams)
  He's chewing our ass
 'cause he's unhappy.


  What are we
 gonna do here?
  I know the answer.


  We have got to get
 that guy a woman.


  A woman who can find him a man.


  Okay, guys, to get Smithers
 off our backs,
  I'm gonna find him
 a boyfriend
  on this.


  Homer, I'm a
 long-haul trucker,
  who's home-straight
 and highway-gay,
  but, uh, how do you know
 about Grinder?
  My wife put me on to it.


  I was looking for an app
 for pepper grinders,
  and I found this.


  Uh, doesn't Smithers
 dig Burns?
  Yeah, but Burns
 doesn't want Smithers.


  Isn't it sad, Marge,
 when somebody really,
  really, really,
 really wants somebody,
  and they're sitting
 across the bar from you
  married to Homer?
  Moe, this is why
 I don't come here much.


  Oh, yeah,
 you're right, Marge.


  Hey, uh, I'm sorry.


  MOE:
 Oh, yeah.


  (groans)
  Can we just find
 a boyfriend for Smithers?
  Finally, a use
 for the Internet.


  Hmm, no.


  No.


  Too smoldering.


  Too lumberjack.


  Too "look how fun I am.

"
  George Takei?
  Click me and we will
 boldly go to Yogurtland,
  but be warned: I don't care
 for people who cling on.


  (laughs)
  (groans)
  Hey, why am I on this?
  Well, only one way
 to find out.


  Swipe.


  Maybe we should just
 invite them all to a party
  and see
 who Mr.

 Smithers likes.


  Good idea.


  (with dramatic affectation):
 Did somebody here swipe me?
  Here's five bucks.


  Visit my Dad.


 Say you're me.


  Finally, I'm paid to act.


  Tell you what,
  if you buy a half-page ad
 in the program,
  Sam plays "As Time Goes By"
 with Hulk hands.


  (register dings)
 You have a deal.


  I'm glad someone's getting
 something from this play.


  (sighs)
  As an understudy,
 all I get is to watch
  Lisa and Jack fall in love.


  Oh, you're still here.


  Look, Milhouse,
 if anything happens
  to that kid playing Rick
  you get the part.


  If you catch my drift.


  You know I can't catch.


  (slurping)
  Don't judge me.


  Jack, you're amazing.


  You're blowing away
 everyone else in the play.


  (in Peter Lorre voice):
 You despise me, don't you?
  (in Humphrey Bogart voice):
 If I gave you any thought,
  I probably would.


  (in normal voice):
 I'll be in my trailer.


  This isn't Fiji water.


  Yo, dingus, someone doesn't
 want you in that play.


  Who let you three gorillas
 out of the zoo?
  (laughs)
  Gorillas.


  It's not funny.


  (grunting, shouting)
  How'd you get the bullies
  to take out Jack?
  The most powerful bribe
 in the world:
  a free full-page ad
 in the play program.


  It's a funny thing about fists,
 everyone gets them,
  but not everyone gets
 the instruction manual.


  Oh, no, his mouth wrote checks
 his fists could cash!
  (gasps)
  Someone is using the go-round
  for non-merry purposes.


  Attention: in Casablanca,
 the part of Rick Blaine
  will now be played by Milhouse.


  Also, the cafeteria
 is out of buns,
  so for hamburgers
 we will now be using
  two slices of day-old toast.


  That is all.


  (crunching loudly)
  Where you're going,
 I can't
  Line!
  Follow!
  Sounds weird to me.


  "I can't follow.

"
  "I can't follow.

"
  Also, why would Nazis
 respect letters of transit
  signed by De Gaulle?
  I may be pulling on a thread,
 but hear me out
  (groans)
  Everything looks
 great, Marge.


  That cheese is
 cubed perfectly.


  Thank you.


  I get queasy when I see
  cubes that are cut
 on the bias.


  (doorbell rings)
  Oh, Mr.

 Smithers.


  Come in, come in, come in.


  Can I get you
 a Tom Collins?
  Hello, Tom Collins.


  Hmm, I see
 what's going on here.


  Fix up your boss
 so he won't be so hard on you.


  Well, nice try.


  I want a vodka tonic,
 and then I'm gonna leave.


  Mr.

 Collins, would you be
 charmed by horror stories
  of working
 with Bill Shatner?
  Uh, who?
  I like you already.


  You know what?
  I don't think that attitude
 is the real you.


  I believe you have
 a pinched nerve in your neck,
  and guess what?
  You're in luck,
 because I give great massage.


  Sorry, not interested.


  (bones popping)
  Wow, wow.


  How did you do that?
  Would you like to discuss that
 over Peruvian tapas?
  Simpson, I'm stealing
 your bartender.


  Take the next
 couple days off.


  Woo-hoo!
  Three day bender!
  Are there any gay-themed songs
 about celebrating?
  Celebrate 
  Good times, come on 
  Let's celebrate 
  Did you used to jog
 with Monty?
  Mm, sort of.


  Come on, let's celebrate 
  There's a party going on
 right here 
  A celebration to last
 throughout the years 
  (door opens)
  (humming)
  Smithers, where have you been?
  I'm dictating my autobiography.


  Chapter One: A Commotion
 at the Telegraph Office.


  I'm afraid I have other plans.


  There are no other plans.


  Now take my picture
 for the back cover.


  No, sir, I don't think I will.


  In fact, what I'm going
 to do is
  quit!
  (gasps) My God, I did it.


  I actually quit.


  No one quits me.


  (groans)
  One more button.


  (screams)
  You're forgetting
 who installed this system.


  Ahoy-hoy!
  So, you want time off
 for your sister's funeral?
  (laughs)
  Miss Naegle,
  release the hounds.


  Wh-What do you mean?
  Send vicious dogs
 to rip him to shreds.


  But wouldn't I be
 criminally liable?
  I said release!
  Release, release!
  That sounds vaguely sexual.


  I'm gonna have to file
 a grievance.


  Also, let's just see how you've
 been treating those hounds.


  What the
  Okay, we're gonna have
  to shut this all down.


  You know, he doesn't
 give me health insurance
  and I, uh,
 I think I have rabies.


  Okay, that's it,
 Mr.

 Burns.


  I'm gonna need to speak
  to your head
 of Human Resources.


  It's this guy.


  Um what are you doing?
  Oh, sorry.


  I used to do that
 for Mr.

 Burns.


  Ah, forget about Burns.


  Ancient-a history.


  I left-a the Italy
 40 years ago,
  but do you see me-a crying
  in my pappardelle rustiche
 con salsiccia e porri?
  Waylon, just what
 did you see in him?
  Now to set her down gently
 on the golf course.


  You're right, totally.


  I'm here for you.


  Listen, I'm making
 a trip to Cuba, okay?
  My homeland,
 where my accent
  is not so reedickoloss.


  Come with me to Havana.


  (Cuban music plays)
  SMITHERS:
 W-wait a minute.


  I'm not sure.


  But this is the route
 we're gonna take.


  Oh, what the hell,
  this is gonna be
 the time of my life.


  I'm in!
  (crying)
  Milhouse is the worst actor
 I've ever seen,
  and I have to play
 opposite him!
  He's so bad.


  Look at his headshot.


  (Marge groans)
  Whenever I'm dealing
 with someone who
  isn't doing a great job,
  what I do is treat them
 like they're perfect.


  (sniffles)
 Really?
  If they sense
 you believe in them,
  they'll get better.


  Did our taxes, Marge.


  The government
 owes us $2 million.


  That is really, really great,
  but maybe
 you should check again.


  What?
  Oh, I my mistake.


  We owe them $37.


  That's some nice adding.


  Yeah.


  (Cuban music playing)
  I've done it.


  I'm happy.


  I'm in a new world
  and completely
 forgotten about
  (shouts)
  What, the buzzard of death?
  (gasps)
  It reminds you of him!
  I'm sorry, sir.


  (gasps)
  You address me
 like I am him.


  Everything reminds you
 of him!
  I bet that mural of him
  being driven out
 of Cuba in 1959
  reminds you of him!
  Waylon, I am a man who needs
 100% commitment, okay?
  Okay, well, maybe not 100,
  but at least, like, 20,
 you know, which is
  the percentage that
 your cell phone needs
  to stay in the green.


  So tell me now, Waylon.


  Am I in the green?
  (sighs)
  I'm afraid not.


  (sobbing) Beneath this mask
 I am crying.


  Everyone who's
 replaced Smithers
  has been nothing
 but trouble.


  You're my lawyers,
 tell me what to do.


  Sir, I think your only option
 is to get Mr.

 Smithers back.


  You'll have to give him money.


  Lots of money,
 but it won't be enough.


  (lawyers muttering agreement)
  Yes, I suppose
 what this calls for
  is a personal apology
 straight from my heart.


  Have it on my desk
 first thing tomorrow
  and write yourselves apologies
 from me to you
  for making you work late,
  and they'd better
 sound sincere.


  You're going to be great.


  I already am
  because you just
 told me so.


  Oh.


  (giggles)
  Thank you.


  So, what brought you
 to Casablanca?
  I came here for the waters.


  There are no waters
 in Casablanca.


  I was misinformed.


  (audience cheers)
  Is it just me or is Milhouse
 really killing it?
  He's like
 a young Noah Wylie.


  (groans)
  If that plane
 leaves the ground
  and you're not with him,
 you'll regret it.


  Maybe not today,
 maybe not tomorrow,
  but soon and for the rest
 of your life.


  (audience cheers)
  You did it, Marge.


  This earns
 my highest praise:
  get through-able.


  Milhouse,
 you were incredible.


  Maybe that's because
  I'm not Milhouse.


  (gasps)
  Oh, but,
 is Milhouse okay?
  Is Milhouse ever okay?
  Good point.

 (laughs)
  Now let's go
 to the soda fountain
  and ask the jerk
 for a float with two straws.


  What year are you from?
  (laughs)
  Oh, who cares?
  Mr.

 Burns, Mr.

 Smithers,
  I make-a something
 very special for your reunion.


  One cheese pizza.


  Well, Smithers,
 I got here
  as soon as I heard
 you wanted to meet.


  Took something called Uber,
 which I thought would be
  a Wehrmacht staff car,
 but turned out to be a
  (groans)
  Prius, driven by a
  (groans)
 woman.


  Now, down to business.


  It's all here.


  Everything it'll take
 to get him back.


  Oh, no, forgot
 the Starbucks card.


  Is it too late to
  Sir, before you start,
  let me say I don't want money,
  and I don't want some letter
 written by your lawyers.


  I want to know
 why you want me back.


  I see.


  Well, the thing is,
  you really care about me,
 don't you?
  Maybe a little, still.


  All right, Smithers.


  There's one thing
 I've never given you.


  I kept it bottled up
 inside all these years
  and here it is
  your performance review.


  (gasps)
  It's excellent.


  Amazingly, that's enough.


  Thank you, sir.


  You must remember this 
  A kiss is just a kiss 
  No music!
  I heard you serve
 10-year-olds.


  That's referring to the age
 of the pickled eggs,
  but, uh, I'll get you a milk.


  Mr.

 Smithers,
 why do guys do
  such stupid things
 when it comes to dames?
  Hey, you been talking
 to that weird Bogart kid?
  He came around here
 trying to talk me
  into an expedition
 to find some gold.


  Yeah, so I'm getting
 the mules.


  Let me tell you about dames,
 Milhouse.


  I know nothing about them,
 but as for love,
  what keeps you going
 is the thrill of the chase.


  The possibility
 that one day you
  might get what you want,
 even though the reality is
  you probably never will.


  That's why I don't
 chase dames.


  Just gold.


  I'll be back in six months
  with one-third
 of the biggest treasure
  you ever saw.

  Ah, my first sucker.

  Oh, a dollar.


  Now I can have lunch.


  Hmm?
  It's a trick!
  I never needed these.

  Oh, lookie here,
  it's the ol' fishing line
 on a dollar bill prank.


  Man, even a backwoods,
 no account, inbred,
  lead-paint-eating,
 kerosene-huffing,
  roadkill-chomping, um,
 what was my point?
  That is a practical joke, Luann.


  Which is too bad, because I
 desperately need that dollar.


  I could also use the
 fishing line to get some dinner.


  Bart, if Milhouse is
 hiding with you,
  tell him he has to shop for
 school clothes.


  Yay! School clothes.


  This isn't right, no one's
 falling for my pranks.


  Huh!
  At least it wasn't
 a total waste.


  I found a quarter.

 are any indication,

 gobsmacking match.


  To see or not to see.


 That is no question.


  Dad, I'm worried.


  No one is falling
 for my pranks anymore.


  Son, I know this seems
  like the biggest disappointment
 of your life, but trust me,
  there are going to be
 so many more.


  What you've got to
 remember is-- oh, my God,
  13 men in the field!

  Yes! Play stands!

  MARGE:
 Here comes the airplane!
  Zhoop!
  Thanks to your late
 football-watching,
  you missed breakfast.


  Eh, don't worry, Marge,
 I'll make my own.


  Meh.


  (bell dings)
  Mom, I've been working on
 a new solo jazz piece.


  (groans)
 Can I hear it?
  (playing jazzy tune)
  Oh, I'd love to stay and listen,
 but I'm late for work.


  Here's another super-fan to hear
 you lay down your licks.

  Mmm! Wall licorice.

  Except for fundamental
 behavioral change,
  but you can't buy that
 at the supermarket.


  (sniffs)
 They do smell nice.


  Hey, Dad, want to hear
 my solo?
  I added a few
 variations today.


  Of course I would.


  Okay.


 Aw, my reed is split.


  I'll be right back.


  I've already heard
 Lisa's song once.


  I've had a long day,
 and to be completely honest,
  I really can't stand jazz.


  (startled gasp)
  What about when
 Lisa plays it?
  All the same.

 Ugh.


  (note plays)
 MARGE: Sounds great, honey.


  (sobs)
  So, you really don't like jazz?

  I never realized we have
 so much in common.


  And scat-singing.

 dee-do I give a darn?
  So, all these years,
 you've been lying to me?

  Be-beep-ba-boop-boop.


  So, let's get it all out here.


  Mom, you were only pretending
 to like it this morning
  when I played
 My Funny Valentine.


  That was My Funny Valentine?
 Hoo-boy.


  Wouldn't expect you to get it.


  (sobbing): So busy juggling
 three children,
  you don't even notice when
 one is hanging by a thread,
  a thread you just cut forever!
  Lisa, this a family.


  You do not take that tone
 with another family member.


  You tell 'em, butterbean.


  Shut up, idiot.


  Lisa, honey, you're hurt,
 but hurting me back
  is not going to feel
 as good as you think.


  Just know that I am
 very, very sorry.


  Hmm!
  Hmph!
  Mm
  Hmm
  (high-pitched):
 Mm!
  Hm!
  (groans playfully)
  Good night, Marjorie.


  (gasps)
  MARGE:
 Marjorie.


  She called me "Mar-jo-rie.

"
  So? Bart calls me Homer.


  You know that's out
 of disrespect.


  Dis-respect?
  Is that a word?
 Yes.


  And there's this guy at work
 that calls me Hoss.


  What's that all about?
  This is awful.


  Lisa and I have
 always been so close.


  Now, for your first day
 at school,
  you get what
 my mother gave me.


  Pearls?
  Just like Mommy's.


  Dad, is there anything
 you pass along?
  Predilection for kidney stones.


  What if Lisa doesn't want
 to be friends with me anymore?
  Marge, it's not your job to be
 friends with your kids,
  it's my job.


 Good night, sweetie.


  (sighs)
 Oh, uh, Bart and I
  are gonna see an
 R-rated movie Saturday.


  It has boobs,
 but they're elf boobs.


  Is that cool?
  Hmm.

 I guess.

  So long, whoopee cushion.


  (fart noise)

  Lisa, our weekend in Capital
 City will make us friends again.


  I don't see your saxophone.


  That must be a relief to you.


  Honey, I want you to bring it.


  Sure, should I grab
 some Kenny G CDs too?
  Some Chuck Mangione?
  That would be lovely!
  Oh, I-I get it, they're popular,
 so you don't like them.


  Just please get your sax.


  Airport shuttle?
  Yes, I'm going on a trip
 with a special little girl.


  That baby is adorable.


  Oh, it's not the baby.


  Great, now I've got
 both daughters mad at me.


  May I say that you sound
 like a terrible mother?
  But no one ever cares what
 the shuttle bus driver thinks.


  "Take me to terminal four,"
 they say.


  Actually, we're
 at terminal three.


  Arguing with everyone
 today, aren't you?
  Okay, we'll see you
 on Monday, Homer.


  I'm feeling really sad too, Dad.


  Nothing cheers people
 up like a baby.


  Hey!
  Boy, we each have to do our
 part, and I'm gonna make dinner.


  And I'm gonna start with
  (gentle, happy melody playing)
  Ice cream!
  Come back!
  Don't make me jog.


  Why is your father chasing
 after the spay and neuter van?
  You got me.


  What do I do with you?
  (chuckles)
 Hey, this is fun.


  (groans affectionately)
  Wow.

 Wow!
  I like having a sister.


  Helps that you
 don't say anything.


    I wonder how you are at pranks.


  BOTH: We're not worthy.


 We're not worthy.


  (scared noises)
  I'm back!
  Don't drop that angel.


  Hi, folks, and welcome to the
 Capital City Dream Tour.


  If you're here for the
 Capital City Crime Tour,
  that leaves in 20 minutes.


  Let's wave to that to that
 ordinary hot dog vendor.


  (hip-hop music plays)
  Wow, he's anything but ordinary.


  You know, I wouldn't
 be surprised
  if he turned up one of Capital
 City's Broadway-caliber shows.

I.

 Jane 
  Let's make it plain 
  How do you train for love?

 you lack is love.

 teams up with a white guy.


  It gives us hope.

 That's the show for Lisa.


  She'll love it!
  The Bad News Bears?
  Is there nothing so beautiful
  that they won't keep exploiting
 till it's worthless?
  Well, they're expensive,
  which means if I die,
 you're still taking me.


  Also, I bought you a little
 present from a street vendor.


  They're earrings.


  He's a cool cucumber, huh?
  Mom, I'm really not
 into jewelry right now.


  (gasps) You're not wearing
 your pearls.


  Um, the clasp wasn't working.


  I can fix it.


  There are some things
 that can't be fixed.


  What are you saying?
  (sobbing):
 You really don't understand
  how much this has hurt me.


  Jazz is my thing, and you
 said you loved my thing,
  but you lied.


  You'll have a daughter
 someday, too.


  And when she yells
 at you like that
  she'll be right.


  (crying)
  LISA: Oh, who can sit
 with their back turned
  as their mother is crying?
  (continues crying)
  A jazz musician, that's who.


  Well, you guys understand.


  Don't look at me,
 I'm a pity present.


  I'm just glad
 I'm not in a salad.


  (continues crying)
  Oh Grand Papa,
 es muy glamouroso.


  Solo lo mejor para my princesa.


 (laughs)
  Why didn't I get in the
 quinceaÃ±era game years ago?
  (chuckles)
  Uh, excuse me, sir,
  I have three sisters turning 15.


  (gasps)
 Oh boy.


  Can you hold baby Maggie here,
  while I check out las tiaras
 para la quinceaÃ±era?
  Oh, a cute little rugrat like
 that? You betcha.


  Hey, look at ol' Gil
 holding a baby.


  I'm not even dropping it.


  Oh! Why did I say that?
  Now it's all I can think about.


  (porcelain shatters)
  Oh, every time I get a great
 job, I drop a baby.


  (both laugh)
  MARGE: If I can just get her
 to share an armrest,
  that would be a start.


  Hmm
 (groans)
    A ragtag bunch of misfits 
  And a no-goodnik rub-a-dub 
  How can I make them winners 
  In baseball 
  And at love? 
  Hm.


    Corey Leak is a hip-shakin',
 rule-breakin' bad boy 
  (effeminately):
 I'm a bad boy.


  But I've got a crush
 on Amanda, so 
  I will mend my roughish 
  (sustained):
 Way 
  s-ah! 
  Oh.


  KIDS:
 Here comes the tying run.


  Tie, Corey, tie.


  You're out!

  But to me, I'm home 
  CAST:
 Time for the 
  Show stopper 
  Yeah!
  The big cork popper 
  (corks popping,
 audience applauds and whistles)
  Lisa, you're gonna have to
 admit it,
  your mom has
 the bad taste of
  well, a mom.


  I'm gonna have to mother
 myself.


  You quit complaining,
 and pretend you like it.


  (groaning quietly)
  I knew she'd come around.


  What's all this nonsense?
  (cheers and applause)
  Quit clapping,
 I've got a hangover.


  We'll win the game 
  Of love! 
  Exit to your left.


  (cheering and applause)
  That's too tight, Bill.


  (orchestra playing
 bouncy melody)
  Wonderful.


  Did it do it for you too?
  Not yet.


  Stand back.


 I said stand back.


  Who are you?
  Oh, you were our
 star tonight.


  That's a performance
 I'll never forget.


  So what are you
 sophisticated ladies up to next?
  Well, I thought we might
 have an after show nosh
  at the Penny Loafer.


  Invitation noted and accepted.


  (chuckles nervously)
 Well, good,
  because getting a table for
 three is so much easier.


  Hey! You're not Nathan Lane!
  (scissors clipping)
  (Homer humming
 happily)
  Here he comes.


  Aw, don't worry, Bart Jr.

,
  Daddy will get that for you.


  (grunts, spits)
  (grunts)
  Why you little
 (grunts)
  Dad, no! You're gonna
 strangle a baby!
  (gasps) Oh my God.


  That would've been horrible.


  Why you little
 (grunts)
  (chokes)
 Turning
  a sweet little baby
  into a you!
  (grunts)
 (Bart continues choking)
  Bart, you're a great kid,
  but if I had
 another one like you,
  I'd hang myself
 from a highway overpass.


  Please, give your sister
 the precious gift
  of not being you.


  Okay, Dad.


  Mags, it was fun
 while it lasted.


  Huh? Ha! I didn't know
 it was that easy.


  (chuckles)
 Stop that!
  (shrieks)
 Sideshow Bob!
  So, Lisa, think
 we'll see any stars?
  Mom, it's a tourist trap.


  Celebrities don't actually
 come in here.


  Until today, right?
  Well, you never know.


  I'll ask the hostess
 if anyone's expected.


  Aw, she keeps doing this.


  I'm sorry, what?
  Every time she tries to
 fix things between us,
  it just emphasizes
 how different we are.


  For what it's worth,
 my mom loved your show tonight.


  She pretty much sees
 the best in everything.


  Amazing, really,
  considering she has a husband
 who randomly shows up to work,
  a son who, God bless him, is
 probably heading for the chair.


  And an ungrateful little girl
  who ignores her mother's frantic
 attempts at reconciliation,
  and tells family secrets
 to a total stranger.


  A total stranger
 The New York Times calls
  "a charming presence.

"
  You don't know me at all!
  But hardly anybody likes jazz.


  Why should I expect my mom to?
  That's right, you have to see
 the other side.


  The one that always
 makes you wrong.


  (sobs):
 Mom.


  Mom, I can't stay mad at you.


  I'm putting my pearls back on.


  Oh, thank you, sweetie.


  And I apologize for
 expressing my sincere feelings.


  (saxophone playing)
  (sighs)
  Why don't you show us
 what you got, Lisa?
  (chuckles) That's right,
 I learned your name.


  It's not all about me,
 Andrew Rannells.


  20 bucks for
 ten minutes with the sax.

  Sorry.


  Don't tell me not to fly

  If someone takes a spill, 
 it's me, and not you 
  Who told you you're allowed
 to rain on my parade 
  Get ready for me, Love 
  'Cause I'm a "comer" 
  I simply got to march 
  My heart's a drummer 
  Nobody, no 
  Nobody 
  Is gonna rain on 
  (sustained):

  (continues holding note,

  Well, what do you think?
  My golden girl.


  (grunts)
  Straight ahead is the the
 19th Street Liquor Store,

  which never fully stopped.

 D'oh!
  Oh, no.


  Oh, I can't read that again.


  I hate to see

  I'll tell you a story
 that'll put you to sleep.


  It's one your mother told me.


  Luann Van Houten
 uses flavored Crisco
  instead of butter
 for shortbread cookies.


  (yawning): Which is,
 apparently, flakier,
  but at what cost?
  (yawning):
 And she (muttering)
  (snoring)
  (Homer muttering)
  HOMER: Wh? Huh?
  What the ?
  Okay, sweetie, I got a story
  about another little girl
  who got lost in the woods,
  but it wasn't a girl,
  and it wasn't the woods.


  (sucking)
  Suck, suck, indeed.


  And it all happened
 once upon a time,
  before you were born,
  and my chances for a man cave
  went out the window.


  (sucking)
  Bless you all for sacrificing
 your Saturday afternoon
  to help us clean up skid row.


  When God came for Sunday,
 I said nothing.


  Now he comes for Saturday.


  Homer Simpson, it's one thing
 to moan and groan on the bus,
  but in front
 of these unfortunates,
  well, (scoffs)
 that just curls my 'stache.


  Hey, Flanders,
 why don't you take some advice
  from your Bible and zip it?
  Oh, where does
 the Bible say zip it?
  It's the first thing the
 burning bush said to Moses.


  Thank you for teaching
 us Scripture.


  Thank you.


  You know,
 all this helping others
  is giving me the most
 satisfying feeling ever.


  So satisfying.


  Uh, Lenny
  Oh, huh.


  I get why they do it.


  Totally get it.


  (whimpers)
  Hey, Carl, you want to buy
 all my stuff for five dollars?
  (dog howling in distance)
  Well, thank you all
 for spending the day
  thinking of others
 instead of yourselves.


  Saturday.


 It was a Saturday.


  Now, a reward to the
 most selfless cleaner:
  A family vacation
 to the Grand Canyon.


  The winner: Ned Flanders.


  Surprise, surprise.


  The guy that did
 the best job wins.


  NED: Mm-hmm!
  But this gift certificate
  is for two families.


  Hey, Reverend, we'd love it if
 you and Helen would join us.


  Um uh uh
  Mm
  Of course we'd love
 to join you,
  but I've noticed
 that you and Homer
  haven't been the
 friendliest "neighboreenos,"
  if you get my diddly.


  Uh, well, Ned, I think
 the Lord would want you
  to take the Simpsons
 on this trip.


  Our Lord?
  Yes.

 Our Lord.


  For would it not
 indeed be glorious,
  if in visiting a natural chasm,
  two quarrelsome neighbors
 would bridge the chasm
  of their own discord.


  Well, I guess if Job
 could accept his burdens.


  Uh, in America,
  it's pronounced "job,"
 Flanders.


  (laughing): We can settle it
 when we're zipped up
  together in a sleeping bag.


  (groans)
  Welcome aboard.


  Oh, oh, we'd love to go,
  but is it such a good idea
 to travel with another family?
  It's fun.


 We travel with the Hibberts
  all the time.


  We ran into you once,
 in Cincinnati.


  And we had dinner.


  We slid our tables together.


  We were in a booth
 we could not get out of.


  (groaning sadly)
  Homie, we should go.


  You and Ned need
 to learn to get along.


  You said the same thing
 about me and Bart.


  No.

 The judge said the same
 thing about you and Bart.


  Judges.

 If they were any
 good they'd be lawyers.


  Okay, we'll go.


  But if Flanders
 gets so annoying
  that I can't
 take it anymore,
  the code word is octopus.


  Can it be something else?
  I don't like things
 with hidden beaks.


  Octopus or nothing.


  Okay.


  So we took eight-year-old Bart,
  and six-year-old Lisa.


  After ten hours of driving,
  I finally saw the most
 glorious site.


  (engine revs,
 then tires screech)
  (groaning)
  Ah ah ah
  Ah ah
  Ah
  (growls)
  Ah, ah, ah
  Ah oh oh, oh, yeah.


  Ah ah yeah.


  (hums)
  (loud swallowing)
  (grunting)
  Ah.


  MARGE:
 Oh.


  It's like Disneyland
 for thin people.


  Did you know that the Grand
 Canyon was created by erosion?
  And before 1871,
 it was called Big Canyon?
  Okay, that's it.


  We're on vacation.


  (crying)
 Why, you little
  (rattling)
  (both grunting)
  (both laughing)
  Whoa.


  Keep 'em coming, boy.


  Oh, ooh.


  That one stung me.


 (laughing)
  Ow.


  That's enough.


  HOMER AND BART:
 Aw.


  We're here to enjoy
 ourselves.


  If you just turn
 your head slightly,
  I think you'll be
 pleasantly surprised.


  No time.


 Homer.


  (GrofÃ©'s "Sunrise" from
 The Grand Canyon Suite playing)
  HOMER:
 Wow.

 Wow.


  And they say we're running
 out of room for our garbage.


  (shudders)
  NED:
 Go tell it on the mountain 
  Over the hills
 and everywhere 
  Go tell it
 on the mountain 
  That Jesus Christ
 is born 
  Born, born, born, born 
  Go tell it on the mountain 
  Octopus.

 Octopus.


  Oct-ar-pus.


  A vacation with Flanders?
  That's like telling you
 a bedtime story without a beer.


  (pop of bottle opening)
  (sighs)
 Now, where were we?
  Thank you, ma'am.


 Eh.


  Thank you.


 Eh.


  Mm-hmm.


  Am I such a terrible mother
  that my son doesn't even know
  to say thank you to a waitress?
  Come on, honey.


 What do you say?
  You want me to lie and say I'm
 thankful for chicken and veg
  when I wanted whiskey-
 battered bourbon bangers?
  Just say thank you.


  My boy never said thank you.


  Now he's on death row.


  Was on death row.


  (snoring)
  Daddy, when will the noise stop?
  Hmm.

 Take these.


  Ugh.

 Those were earplugs.


  (boys groan)
  Wow, I never thought there'd
 be something I'd want
  to stare at longer than that
 car wreck on the way here.


  We've got to hurry before
 they run out of mules.


  Ooh.

 Is that what they're
 serving for breakfast?
  (Marge groans)
  HOMER:
 How about donkeys?
  MARGE:
 No.


  Huh? That's odd.


  Enjoying your moon view, Homer?
  Why you little
  Two can play at that game.


  (squeaking)
  (groaning)
  (Bart laughing)
 Stupid kid.


  So embarrassing.


  I'm a little nervous
  with all these waivers
 we have to sign.


  Marge, this is a national park.


  People are completely safe here.


  Now let's do my favorite thing:
  go downhill.


  Whoa.


 You're 180?
  My blood pressure is.


  Okay.

 Uh, let's get
 you a mule, dude.


  Oh
  (loud braying)
  Get me El Gordo.


  Gordo here used to carry
  200-pound granite blocks
  up from the canyon.


  (Gordo groaning)
  (GrofÃ©'s "On the Trail" from
 The Grand Canyon Suite playing)
  This has got to be
 the most beautiful thing
  we've ever stole
 from the Indians.


  (car engines)
  What is that?
  A billionaires' retreat.


  Yeah, the heads of America's
  most powerful media companies
  have come to enjoy nature.


  DRIVER:
 Put up the cell phone tower.


  I said I wanted
 a Tom Cruise type,
  not Tom Cruise.


  Burn down the
 cell phone tower.


  I can't stand rich people.


  Can I name my mule?
  We prefer you don't.


  Is there a name
 for this trail?
  I'm sure there is.


  Is this a fun job?
  Not at the moment.


  Do you count as a grownup?
  My parents don't think so.


  You're a grownup to me.


  Thanks.


  Here, have a piece
 of the canyon.


  Are you sure it's okay?
  Hey, it only makes
 the canyon grander.


  BOTH:
 Aah! Aah!
  Aah!
  I don't know where your
 son gets it, Marge.


  I'm only going
 to say this once,
  but I think you're
 a little checked out.


  (echoing):
 Checked out.

 Checked out.


  Checked out.

 Checked out.


 Checked out.


  Checked out.

 Checked out.


  Checked out.


  Well, your kids
 aren't exactly perfect.


  Yay! We can improve.


  Let's think
 about it quietly.


  (groans)
  (sniffing)
  Boy, I bet that mustache
 smells really bad, huh?
  Oh, don't you rip
 on my lip strip.


  (sniffs)
  I smell candles
 and-and pew polish.


  We're near a church.


  (sniffs) Catholic, if I
 don't miss my guess.


  Hmm.


  A little Popish for my taste,
  but I did come here
 for adventure.


  Geez, Flanders, you find
 God in everything.


  God is in everything.


  He's omnipresent.


  You mean, if I check into
 the Omni Hotel right now,
  he's there?
  As a matter of fact, he is.


  Then, from now on,
 we're staying
  at the Hyatt Regency.


  You're banned there, Dad.


  Not as Hagwar Swanson.


  (with Scandinavian accent):
 I love this country.


  (shudders)
  Are you sure
 this is safe?
  Totally.

 You're with
 State Farm, right?
  Where's our guide?
  Where's the trail?
  (squawking)
  (humming)
  Aw.


  (shrieks)
 Big Maggie.


  I'd like to hear the rest.


  I still have my piece
 of the canyon.


  Ugh.


  (growls)
  Okay.

 It was looking rough
  Oh, no bars.


  You mean,
 on your phone?
  Hey, you're right.


  Oh, more bad news.


  Oh, most of the food
 was on the guide's mule.


  I sure am glad somebody
  packed all this whitefish salad.


  I'm willing to eat some.


  And if I die, you know it's bad.


  Homer, it's time for you and
 me to go out and get help.


  Please be careful,
 Uncle Ned.


  I will, Bart.


  Please, please
 be careful.


  Don't worry.


  If you don't come back,
 I'll be so sad.


  Excuse me?
 What about over here?
  Right.


  (grunts)
 Please, please be careful.


  (braying)
  Please.


  Let's go, Flanders.


  Oh, no.

 The poor thing
 gets night terrors.


  I forgot to say
 "God bless the mailman.

"
  He's not awake,
 but he's not asleep.


  Do your kids get these?
  I will now that I know
 what they are.


  Other kids say I'm
 in their nightmares.


  I'm not your puppet, Bart.


 I'm not.


  (grunting)
  You ever seen stars
 this bright, Homer?
  Blessed is the beauty
 of our Lord.


    (sighs)
  (gunshots)
  (clicking)
  Amen.

 Listen, Flanders.


  This trip has given me
 time to think.


  If I die here,
  you're welcome to live
 in my carcass for warmth.


  I'm not living
 in your carcass.


  Oh, come on.


  You make it sound
 like a bad thing.


  Look, we're saved!
  We just go down there,
 get some food and help
  returning to civilization.


  GUARD (over megaphone):
 Attention, people talking.


  Unless you are here
 to dispose of our poop,
  we will start shooting
 in five minutes.


  (dance music playing)
  (animals screeching)
  How is that even camping?
  It's easier for a camel
  to pass through
 the eye of a needle
  than a rich man
 to get into heaven.


  Sometimes I just
 don't get it.


  What I'm saying is,
 the eye of the needle
  is very small,
 and a camel
  No.

 I mean down there--
  they have everything
 we need to survive,
  but they won't share.


  Maybe if I look through
  these binoculars one more time,
  I'll-I'll see
 something better.


  (gasps)
  We've got to go in
 and steal what we need.


  Well, thou shalt not steal.


  But if I don't steal,
 that's coveting.


  That's bad, too.


  Look, Flanders,
 we tried things your way,
  and it failed.


  Now let's try mine.


  Okay.


  W-Wait!
  We never did things my way.


 Too late.


  (voice fading):
 I'm already rolling downhill.


  Ow, sharp rock.


  Ooh, cactus!
  (screams)
 More scorpions.


  Is that all you can do? Sting?
  (yells)
 Now they're pinching.


  (whispering): Easy, Flanders,
 don't make a sound.


  Okay, here.


 (Ned grunting)
  Come on, take this.


  (both grunting)
  Oh, I got it.


  Oh, it's heavy.


  (brays)
  Ready to go.


  (gunshots)
  Uh, we're too heavy.


  Toss off what
 we don't need.


  (grunting)
  (gunshot)
  Fine.

 We can do
 without salad forks.


  Whoo-hoo!
  No sugar tonight
 for the coffee 
  No sugar tonight
 for their tea 
  We took all their
 fancy cheeses 
  And their tasty charcuterie 
  (growls)

  Grand Canyon! Yeah!
  (air whooshing)
  You know, Homer,
 we make a good team.


  Homer?
  HOMER:
 Breakfast time.


  Come and get it!
  (echoing):
 Come and get it!
  Come and
  Ugh.

 Not again.


  Tablecloths.


  Caviar.


  Bacon!
  (munching)
  Bacon.


  No, this was before
 Lisa was a vegetarian.


  That's right.

 I had the
 arteries of a 20-year-old.


  I'm gonna miss you, pal.


  (neighs)
  (chuckles)
  Well, Homer,
  you think this will be
 one of those vacations
  where the friendship
 we made will last forever
  or start eroding the minute
 we enter our cars?
  Flanders, like all
 friendships between men,
  in the end it's
 up to our wives.


  Mm-hmm.


  NED:
 That was a nice story, Homer.


  You know, sometimes
 I wish this
  (chuckles)
 grand canyon between us,
  uh, wasn't so large.


  The offer still stands.


  You can live in my carcass.


  There's room in my legs
 for the boys.


  Maybe we could just
 store old clothes in you.


  I'd like that.


  And you know what, Flanders?
  I think we owe
 you guys a trip.


    Always wanted to visit
 the postcard museum.


  Thank you.


  My pleasure.


  I wonder if they sell
 postcards in the gift shop.


  We don't.

  I've never seen this.


  It must've been left
 by some previous owner.


  Holy moly!
  A valuable antique car!
  This is the find of a lifetime!
  Oh, it's a stick.


  (grunting)
  (engine starts)
  Dad, shouldn't we see
 who owns the car?
  Now, sweetie, according to
 the ancient law of trover,
  abandoned property passes
 to the subsequent landowner.


  Man, ever since you watched
 Medieval Tomb Robbers
  on the History Channel,
  everything with you is
 trover, trover, trover.


  Boy, either show me a writ
 of replevin or pipe down.


    (tires screech)
  Chubby dude in a tiny car 
  Making friends
 both near and far 
  In this little town
 he's a shooting star 
  That's a chubby dude 
  In a tiny car 
  From Shelbyville to Zanzibar 
  It doesn't matter
 where you are 
  There's not a thing
 that can com-par 
  To a chubby dude
 in a tiny car.

 
  Aw, the needle's on "E.

"
  Uh, I got something
 that works as gasoline.


  (bell dinging)
    (honks jauntily)
  Daddy's home!
 Daddy's home!
  Hello, children.


  For you, daughter,
 a little ragdoll.


  For you, son, a Florida orange.


  You know, there's something
 truly amazing about you, Dad.


  Everything's an adventure.


  You go to clean the garage
  and you find a classic car.


  Yes, fortune favors the bald.


  Now for the best part:
  sharing my great day
 with your mom.


  (hums, spits)
  Well, if it isn't my favorite
 gal in my favorite room.


  I'm glad you had a good day.


  You don't sound glad.


  I'm not glad.


  But you said
 you were glad.


  You need to read
 between the lines.


  Why? There's just
 white space there.


  (sighs deeply)
  (voice breaking):
 I'm sorry, Homie.


  Your life is full
 of fun surprises.


  My life sucks.


  (sobbing)
  HOMER:
 Uh-oh.

 Tissues?
  (sniffs)
  Oh
  Well, would it help
 if I rubbed your back?
  Huh? Eh? Uh?
  Your hands smell
 like steering wheel.


  (sniffs)
 Hmm.


  Poor Marge.


  What do I do?
  Help me, universe!
  (doorbell rings)
  Jay Leno?
 Hiya!
  I was just passing
 in my 1973 Citroen DS Pallas
  when I saw that classic Morgan
  with the original wood
 dash interior.


  Man, I-I'd like to buy it.


  You'll have to pay cash
 with no questions asked.


  How much you want?
  I said no questions!
  Don't worry,
 this car is a piece of art,
  going where it will be admired.


  To my secret underground
 car depository!
  (groaning)
  (sighs)
  It's time for me to do
 what I do best:
  prolong this marriage.


  You wanted a good
 surprise, Marge?
  You've got it.


  We are going on
 the trip of our lives.


  Really? Where?
  (doorbell rings)
  I'll be right back.


  Let your imagination
 run wild.


  Hey, Homer.


  And you are?
 Jay Leno.


  Hey, do you still have that
 money I gave you for the car?
  Sure do.


  Well, uh, I'm gonna
 need it back.


  But I just
 promised my wife
  Homer, I've collected
 hundreds of antique cars
  on the theory that they don't
 make 'em like they used to.


  Well, I just bought
 this new Toyota.


  Turns out it's much better.


  I can go to the store
 and make it all the way back,
  it doesn't break down once.


  Imagine that?
 Geez.


  Yeah.


  Here's your money back.


  Can I have my car?
  Unfortunately, when
 I went to register it,
  it wasn't your car.


  So the-the police took it.


  Chubby cop in a tiny car 
  Going to the nearest
 cop bar 
  Well, see ya.


 (car lock beeps)
  Unbelievable!
 It opens from here.


  (laughs)
 The age we live in!
  I've decided where
 I want to go.


  Um, ooh, the trolley
 at the mall?
  No, Paris!
  The most romantic city
 in the world.


  (groans)
  Paris?
  What am I gonna do?
  (beeps)
  A travel agent!
  Oh, thank God
 you're not obsolete yet.


  And a good morning
 to you, sir.


  Here's the problem.


  I've disappointed
 my wife so many times,
  I can't do it once more.


  I see.


  So I have to take her and
 our three kids to Paris.


  But here's the challenge:
 I have no money.


  Uh, let me see
 what I can do.


  Anything coming up?
  No, it's not plugged in.


  The noise helps me think.


  All right.


  There is a way
  but it is a tad risky.


  Would you consider
 being a casual courier?
  You mean not like the fancy guys
 that ride the bicycles
  Let me explain.


  The mob-- I mean,
 the courier company--
  will pay airfare
 and hotel,
  and all you have to do
 is deliver a package.


  But you cannot look
 inside the package.


  Sure.

 For Marge, I will make
 the supreme sacrifice
  of not doing something.


  (humming)
  That's the "package.

"
  What package?
  The package
 you're delivering.


  Ooh.


  And the clients have
 asked me once more
  to remind you
 not to look inside.


  Hey, buddy, I didn't
 start doing this yesterday!
  I started doing it
 right now.


  Uh the package?
  Hmm.


  Paris!
  I can't believe it!
  Homer Simpson,
  just when I think you have
 nothing left to offer,
  you whisk me to the birthplace
 of existentialism.


  Now, if you'll excuse me,
  it's an 11-hour flight
  and I have to
 visit the "Louvre.

"
  (chuckles)
  (humming)
  (annoyed chatter)
  MAN:
 Can't see the movie now.


  HOMER:
 Everything's great.


  Absolutely great.


  Yet, there's something
 in that briefcase
  and it could get us in trouble.


  My mind's running wild.


  And you're not supposed
 to run on an airplane.


  Oh, that's it, I have
 to open the briefcase.


  (short scream)
  Oh, what a cute,
 blue sna
  (muffled grunts)
  (hyperventilating)
  HOMER: Okay, first thing,
 I've gotta figure out
  if it can breathe in there.


  D'oh!
  Hmm.

 Better try the other eye.


  D'oh!
  Okay, maybe
 the first eye again.


  What the?
  I found it.


  It's an Amazon
 Blue Constrictor.


  Ooh, it's a very rare
 and endangered species.


  Oh, the trip
 of a lifetime.


  (sighs)
  (whispering):
 I can't break her heart.


  (whispering): Well, you can't let anything
 bad happen to that snake.


  I promise.


  And you have to
 promise to preserve
  another endangered
 species my marriage.


  I promise.


  Oh, for the first time,
 a snake has ruined paradise.


  I'll get the luggage.


  Marge, you and
 the kids grab a cab.


  A Parisian cab.


  (French accent):
 Taxi.

 Taxi.


  (giggles)
 Taxi.


  Are you casual courier
 Homer Simpson?
  I am.


  Here is your money.


  Finally.

 I've been
 here for two minutes.


  Listen, what's gonna happen
 to, uh, the package?
  Oh, it will have
 a fine home.


  A wonderful home.


  As the belt around the waist
 of a well-dressed woman.


  I am not gonna let you
 hurt that snake!
  You have to say "Lisa, catch"
 before you throw it.


  Come on.


 (grunts)
  Where did they go?
  Maybe we shouldn't have stopped
 for that seven-course meal.


  Oh, maybe we should just
 have six, like peasants!
  So, back home we call this
 the tire fire.


    Man, look at
 those gargoyles.


  That's from back when
 religions still knew
  how to scare the
 crap out of you.


  Homie, I have to ask.


  Why are you carrying
 that briefcase?
  I just brought
 a little work.


  You don't even bring
 your work to work.


  (grunts)
  I'm sorry.

 I just
 want this family
  to have one trip
 that's great.


  Not like Australia
 or Brazil, Japan, London,
  China, that World's Fair
 Bart drove to,
  that place with
 the underground jockeys
  So, Dad, what are you
 gonna do with the snake?
  Itchy and
 Scratchy Land,
  outer space
  Lisa, I've come
 to understand
  a snake's natural habitat
 is not a briefcase.


  So I'm going
 to set him free.


  Oh, may I suggest the
 gardens of the Louvre?
  They're filled with delicious rats.


 (gasps)
  (whoops)
  It's a shame Lisa
 and your father had
  that errand and
 couldn't join us.


  But on the upside
  More pÃ¢tÃ© please!
  Vraiment?
 You want more pÃ¢tÃ©?
  Yes, before my cruelty-
 free daughter shows up.


  Perhaps madam
 would like to order
  from our extra
 cruelty menu.


  We have a coq Au vin made
 from an old rooster
  who was kicked to death in front
 of his wife and children.


  Very nice.


  On second thought,
 I'll just have a salad.


  Ah, trÃ¨s bien.


  Gilles, gouge the eyes
 out of some new potatoes!
  Ugh, I can't stand to
 look at this anymore.


  Bart, can you ditch this
 in the alley for me?
  (clamoring)
  Hmm.


  Starving models.


  Well, Bart Simpson never met
  a beautiful woman
 he couldn't prank.


  Dad, I love being on a caper
 in France with you.


  Well, this is gonna be a snap.


  All we need is
 to get our tickets
  from this automatic
 French ticket dispenser.


  (grunting)
  (female voice speaking French)
  Shut up.

 Shut up.

 Shut up!
  FEMALE VOICE:
 Votre billet.


  Dad, you just bought
 a ticket to Argenteuil.


  Prochain client,
 s'il vous plaÃ®t.


  Stop speaking French,
 damn you!
  MALE VOICE (speaking German):
 Die Maschine nicht zu schlagen!
  Yes, sir.


  (upbeat runway music plays)
  Here, skinny, skinny.


  Here, skinny,
 skinny.


  (models grunting)
  BART:
 I've never been happier.


  Okay, you're free.


  Now, remember to respect
 this ecosystem.


  Come on, go.


  You'll be a snake
 that lives in Paris.


  It's a children's book
 that writes itself.


  UGOLIN:
 Not so fast!
  (gasps)
 How did you find us?
  All tourists come
 to the Louvre.


  Hey, it's got great paintings.


  Oh, yeah? Name two.


  Uh uh
  Uh
  Don't patronize us!
  You make belts from snakes.


  We treat our high
 fashion animals
  in the most
 humane manner.


  (gasps)
 You're monsters.


  True, but that is just
 a part of who we are.


  We are also poets.


  Communists.


  Experts on mustard.


  They're gone!
  If we want to be criminals,
  we should keep
 a better eye on people.


  It's really not that hard.


 Do not worry.


  There is one surefire way
 to find the Americans.


  Marco!
  HOMER (far off):
 Polo!
  I say, "Marco!"
  HOMER (closer):
 Polo!
  LISA:
 Dad, control yourself.


  HOMER:
 I got it.


  Marco!
  HOMER:
 Polo! Oh, he tricked me.


  (fading):
 Marco! Marco! Marco! Marco!
  Polo!
  Now what are we gonna
 do with the snake?
  We'll just have
 to keep him with us.


  (gasps)
  What is it, Lisa?
  Do you see a
 Burger King?
  We're at rue des Lombards,
  home of the three most famous
 jazz clubs in Paris.


  What do you think, Dad?
  Just pull the rope, please.


  (playing jazz)
  How old are you?
  Eight.


  TrÃ¨s bien.


  We need a doctor!
  And someone who
 can play saxophone!
  Oh, which is which?!
  I'll show you.


  LISA:
 I've never been happier.


    (sighs)
  (sighs)
  (sighs)
  (sighs)
  Plastered in Paris.


  There's no better feeling.


  (sighing)
  Marge, there's something
 I need to tell you.


  That briefcase.


  I knew it was trouble.


  Yes, this is
 my Battle of Essling.


  Unless Napoleon had a more
 famous defeat I'm not aware of.


  (gasps)
  I've been smuggling this
 snake this whole trip.


  But it was the only way
 I could pay for it,
  and you wanted
 to go so badly.


  And besides, those French
 crooks couldn't catch anybody.


  There they are!
 No, no bridge!
  We'll have to board
 a Bateau Mouche.


  A little champagne, some
 dancing, and then
  (groans)
 They're gone again!
  This joie de vivre
 is killing us.


  HOMER: Man, I never thought
 I'd be so glad
  to get back to our own
 arrondissement.


  (French accent):
 Ooh-la-la-la-la.


  You have despoiled
 our supermodels,
  let an American perform
 with a French combo,
  and stolen these poor
 gentlemen's snake.


  Well, I guess this is the point
 that comes in every vacation
  where I say run! Run!
  (sighs)
  Okay, don't run.


  Better cuff this one.


  No snake!
  What's on the desk?
  Just a few dozen urgent messages
 from someone called "Grampa.

"
  This one says the cat
 is eating his toast.


  I have no time
 for cats and toast.


  Search the room.


  We have searched their room
 from armoire to bidet.


  Eh, no snake.


  Maybe we were
 wrong about you.


  Let's see if the police
 dogs can do anything.


  (yipping)
  I keep telling you
 they're worthless.


  But they're
 so damn cute.


  (yipping)
  All right, Simpsons,
 I apologize.


  As for you,
 set the dogs on them.


  (yipping)
  Prepare to have
 your ankles nipped!
  (yipping)
  I just want to say
 that before we came,
  our family was falling apart
 like your European Union.


  But just a few days
 in your wonderful country,
  and now we're better
 than ever.


  All is forgiven, my friends.


  Enjoy la douce France.


  And now something we should have
 done the moment we met you.


  Come on, you guys
 kiss like grandmas.


  Get in there.


  I don't know how we did it,
  but we finally lucked
 into a great vacation.


  In Paris, a lady
 makes her own luck.


    Now my favorite part
 of each trip.


  The gifts I brought back
 for my friends.


  For Carl,
 a French Coca-Cola.


  Ah, trÃ¨s chic.


  For Lenny, a miniature
 Empire State Building.


  We had a layover  in New York.


 Wow.


  And for Moe, a belt made
 out of a blue snake.


  Artificial, I think.


  Thank you.


  Ook.


  @elderman
  Shh!
     


                





                    			1
 The Simpsons 27x21 
 Simprovised
  WIGGUM: Yeah, I know Ralphie's birthday
 is coming up.


  Of course
 I'm gonna get him a present.


  I'm at the
 at the toy store right now.


  Let's see,
 present for Ralph,
  present for Ralph
  Ooh, what do we have here?
  Boy, Ralph would kill himself
 with this in two seconds.


  And somehow it'd be my fault.


  Mm!
  This money has been sitting here
 since 1998,
  not doing anybody any good.


  I want to get Ralphie
 something nice.


  Yeah, a few thousand should do.


 Hm-mm.


  (whistling a tune)
  Uh, you heard me
 whistling there, right?
  That indicates innocence.


  Uh, proclaiming your innocence
 indicates guilt.


  Uh, yeah?
 Well, what does this mean?
  Skiddily bop and bah! 
  (whooping)
  (engine revving,
 tires squealing)
  (kids shouting playfully,
 noisemaker honking)
  Okay, so, at a Ralph party,
 always get to the cake before
  Too late.


  (both gasp)
  HOMER: That's the best damn
 treehouse I've ever seen!
  (heavenly music plays)
  Fine.

 I'll rub my eyes
 the other way.


  (inspiring orchestral
 fanfare plays)
  D'oh!
  (lively chatter, laughing)
  Whee!
  Whee!
  Whoa!
  The September issue!
  (gentle classical music plays)
  Whoo! Free wood!
  (Homer whoops)
  (groans): Oh
 my treehouse sucks.


  Haw-haw!
  (singsongy):
 You have class envy!
  (slurring):
 Nelson, honey,
  I told you to stop
 sayin' "haw-haw.

"
  Give me a dollar
 and I'll stop.


  I don't got a dollar.


  Haw-haw!
  (Homer hums happily)
  Do you want to practice
 your speech on me?
  (chuckles)
 No need, honey.


  Same speech
 I give every year.


  The opening joke about
 Lenny's grandma always kills.


  You can't joke about her--
  they just put her
 on life support.


  What?! No!
 She's the linchpin!
  It's okay, it's okay.


  Everyone is terrified
 of public speaking.


  But just in case, I'll
 defrost a failure ham.


  (dramatic musical stinger)
  You don't have faith in me!
 I have savers.


  If I get heckled, I'll say,
 "Get a half-life!"
  I'm sure that'll
 be funny to them.


  Mm! (kisses)
  (whimpers)
  Calm down, Homer.


  Just leave your body.


  Oh, no!
  What the hell is this?!
  (humming happily)
  (startled grunt)
  Ooh, throwing away
 your "No Girls" sign?
  Is it time for you to have
 "the talk" with your dad?
  Because he's gonna have
 to read a few things first.


  No.

 I'm tearing it down.


  Ralph has a cool treehouse,
 and mine sucks.


  Well, Bart, your
 father built it,
  and he did the
 very best he could.


  (grunting)
  I did my job.


 Now it's your turn, tree.


  Get growing.


  I'll tell you what, why don't
 I spruce it up for you.

 Huh?
  But you're
 an inside grown-up.


  Moms can't build
 treehouses.


  You realize that saying that is gonna
 make this mom work her keister off
  to make you the best darn
 treehouse you ever saw!
  Sounds good.


  (Marge screams)
  Don't worry.


  You forget, most of that's hair.


  BURNS (chuckles):
 So I said,
  "Get a half-life!"
  (laughter)
  (chuckles)
  Funny and handsome.


  And I hear he's loaded.


  (chuckles):
 Yes.


  Now, to end this perfect
 day on the perfect note,
  Mr.

 Homer Simpson.


  (footsteps echoing)
  (footsteps echoing louder)
  (man coughs)
  You're gonna do great, Homer.


 You're gonna kill.


  You're gonna-- oh, where did
 all these people come from?!
  (gunshot)
 Aah!
  Uh, uh
  Webster's Dictionary
 defines a speech
  as a series of words that
  (murmuring)
 elo quently
  I've never seen anyone
 bomb like that.


  Yeah.

 I really feel
 badly for the guy.


  Boo!
 Boo!
  (audience booing)
  (whimpering, shuddering)
  I'm a failure.


  Shall I release
 the hounds, sir?
  Mm, the therapy hounds.


  Oh, oh, I feel a little better.


  Now release the real hounds.


  (dogs barking)
  (Homer screaming)
  It's a pretty good
 seminar this year.


  Dad, what's wrong?
 Did your speech go badly?
  How do you know
 something's wrong?
  You're drinking
 from a can of corn.


  Hmm? Eh.


  Aw, Dad, do you know
 Barbra Streisand
  once forgot
 the words to a song
  and didn't perform in public
 again for nearly three decades?
  Yeah, but she still had
 James Brolin to cuddle.


  So, on a scale of
 ten to ten, how'd you do?
  Um
  (water dripping)
  Drip drop, you flop 
  Drip drop, you flop 
  Drip drop, you flop 
  Drip drop, you flop 
 Fail, fail, fail 
  Drip drop, you flop 
 Fail, fail 
  (squeaky voice): What the hell
 is your problem, idiot!
  (kettle whistling,
 Homer gasping)
  I don't know!
  (sobbing):
 I don't know!
  (Homer whimpers)
  I know what will cheer you up.


  We'll go to the comedy club
 downtown.


  Downtown? With all
 those desperate addicts?
  Oh, the city cleaned them up
 and made them comics.


  Cool!
  Homie, you're gonna chuckle
 your blues away.


  This is the best
 kind of comedy.


  No writers.


 Amen to that, Marge.


  And I appreciate this,
 but I really resent
  the two-drink minimum!
  You always drink more
 than two drinks.


  But no one makes me.


  Three Long Island
 iced teas, please.


  Okay, we're gonna perform
 a little improv.


  First we need a location.


  Uh, 40.

7 degrees
 north latitude,
  74 degrees
 west longitude.


  Ah, yes, New York City.


 Now we need a relationship
  for me and Cathy here.


  Loveless marriage!
  (laughs):
 Okay, I heard loveless marriage.


  These guys are pros.


  All they did was ask
 for two premises.


  That's two more
 than you've asked for.


  (sighs):
 Oh, boy.


  All right, all we need now
 is an object.


  Anyone.


  (quietly):
 Fear of public speaking
  Sorry, didn't hear that.


  Oh fear of public speaking.


  Maybe he has trouble
 talking in the dark.


  Hey, Jerry,
 bring up number seven.


  (shrieks)
  No! Jerry, no!
  Aah! No! Aah!
  Jerry, stop it! No!
  Don't Aah!
  Oh, no! Oh-ho-ho! Aah! Oh!
  Okay, okay, okay, um
 fear of public speaking.


  Well, that's
 not really an object,
  but we'll make it work.


  New York City,
 loveless marriage,
  fear of public speaking.


  They've pulled back the bow--
 now let the arrow take flight.


  You know, I'm gonna
 move over a seat.


  We now take you to an apartment
  on 68th and
 Columbus Avenue.


  (trembling):
 Oh eeh
  aah aah ooh
  What? What?
 Cathy, what's wrong?
  I-I I-I
  I ah-ah-ah ah
  Aw, for heaven's sakes, Cathy,
 when we got married,
  you used to speak for hours.


  But since we moved
 to New York City, nothing!
  (audience laughing)
 Wow.

 It all magically fits.


  Come on, Cathy,
 say something! Anything!
  (Italian accent):
 Fuggedaboutit!
  (laughter, applause)
  And scene!
  I said "fear of
 public speaking.

"
  Yes, you did.

 Very nice.


 Return to your seat immediately.


  Wow.

 Wow.

 These guys
 do everything I can't.


  Maybe they can teach me.


  I don't know that
 they're interested in that.


  $500 for the first
 eight classes.


  That's kind of expensive.


  Couldn't people just form
 their own groups for free?
  And scene.


  Uh, uh excuse me,
 is this the, uh,
  improv class?
  Yes, and come in.


  Sit anywhere?
  Yes, and be quiet.


  HOMER:
 This is it.


  I feel my mind exploding
 with premises.


    So many ideas,
  but how do I turn them
 into comedy?
  Oh, kiss me 
  Beneath the milky twilight-- 
  (chuckling)
  Homer, could-could you
 stay with us, please?
  I don't know how.


  The secret is
 to lose yourself
  and become, say,
 a suicidal auctioneer.


  I could not possibly imagine
 what such a person would say.


  Well, just remember,
 it's-it's not you.


  Don't you get it?
 The secret to life
  has been right in front of you
 all along:
  Don't be yourself!
  Uh, uh, okay.


  What am I bid for this noose?
  Do hear $100?
  No?
  Going going
  (chokes)
  (laughter)
  That's great! Really took
 my mind off my sick grandmother.


  (electronic chime)
 Oh.


  Looks like the hospital
 left a message.


  (voice breaking): Gotta go.


 HOMER: See ya!
  (laughing):
 It made me laugh.


  So, then, you pay me?
 No, never!
  And if you open your own school,
 we'll break your legs!
  You want to give him the
 one we can never crack?
  Queen of Norway buying a car.


  (high-pitched):
 Oh, dear! I can't a-fjord it!
  A star is born.


  (grunting)
  Excuse me.


  I'm from the city.


 Are you aware that you live
  in a historical treehouse
 preservation district?
    May I see your permits?
  I don't have permits.


  (screams)
  Don't worry.


  D-Don't worry.


  I'll take care of it.


  (grunting)
  I've gotta hand it
 to you, Dad.


  You went from
 fear of public speaking
  to starting
 your own improv troupe.


  Improv is exciting,
  but totally safe.


  Like driving a helicopter
 on the ground.


  Um, that's not safe.


  Don't deny the premise.


  That's anti-improv.


  Note for new character,
 "Auntie Improv.

"
  (high-pitched):
 May I hear a suggestion?
  People, don't freak out,
  but the improv critic from the
 Springfield Shopper
  is in the audience.


  (gasps)
 Steve Thurlson?
  No, Thurlson is
 their improv reporter.


  Grant Hood is
 their improv critic.


  Then who's Jennifer Whitehead?
  Oh, she writes
 improv think pieces.


  You know, trends,
 big picture stuff.


  Who does the top ten list
  at end-of-year
 "Best of Improv" issue?
  They each write their own.


  (all murmuring assent)
 Oh, yeah.


  I forgot about that.


 That's true.


  Huh!
  (piano riff playing)
  (applause)
  Hi, everybody.


  We are "Premises, Premises.

"
  Yes, it says on Google that
 there are 5,012 improv groups
  with that name.


  LENNY:
 Take it, Homer.


  (nervously):
 Uh, okay, I need a location.


  Uh, Jackson Square
 in New Orleans.


  And a type of person
 that might be there.


  Someone with confidence.


  Mm, I
  (Cajun accent):
 I ga-ron-tee it!
  (applause and cheering)
  So, Tuesday is the
 treehouse warming.


  Nelson's gonna
 show us his mom's bra.


  (gasps)
  That's the thing
 that boobs touch.


  Whoa, automatic blinds.


  Yeah, I think my
 mom put those in.


  No need to thank her.


  She's just doing her job.


  (grunts)
  The Keebler Elves are real!
  Pass the gravy, Bart.


  Yo.


  Thank you.


  Geez, who ordered the crab?
  (gasps)
 There's crab?
  There's no crab.


  There's no "thank you's",
 no appreciation.


  Nothing.


  Uh, who was that directed at?
  Bart!
  Whew!
 Pass the gravy, please.


  (phone chimes)
  (gasps)
 Dad! Dad!
  The Springfield Fringe Festival
 just invited us to perform.


  Huh? What's a "Fringe Festival"?
  My guess would be it's a
 three-day series of performances
  by alternative
 comedy and music acts,
  including, but not limited to,
  improv, stand-up, light circus
 work and ironic burlesque.


  We're gonna be on the
 main stage on closing night!
  This is going in my log.


  Yay!
  (chuckles)
 More crab for me.


  MARGE:
 There's no crab!
  Mm!
  (humming happily)
  (grunts, slurps)
  Mmm!
  (Marge grunting)
  Aw, Marge,
 don't take it to heart.


  Kids are ungrateful,
 that's their job.


  You can cheer up watching me
 at the Fringe Festival.


  Good for you.


  The main stage, closing night,
 all eyes on you.


  Wh-Wh-Wh-What
 what are you saying?
  Oh, she's making me
 nervous again.


  But now I'm a trained
 comedy amateur.


  No one can get in my head.


  Marge Simpson,
  you don't want to accidentally
 undermine him like last time.


  Oh, thank God he doesn't know
 what I'm thinking.


  I know exactly
 what she's thinking.


  That if I mess this up,
 I'll be worse off than ever.


  He does know.


  She knows I know!
  (Homer and Marge scream)
  MARGE: Homer?
 (muffled): Aw, what?
  I slept on it, and
 I'm madder than ever.


  Go get Bart.


  Oh my God, Marge,
  you woke up with
 morning-would-be-mad.


  Okay, I'll put this
 in your new language.


  Location: Bart's room.


  Action: bring him here.


  Can I get
 a character, please?
  Fine.

 Um
  A near-sighted Frankenstein.


  Okay.


  (growling)
  Bride! Bride!
  I do not look like
 the Bride of Frankenstein.


  (as monster):
 Don't deny premise.


  (growls)
  (knocking on door)
  (grunts)
  BART:
 Mom, can I come in?
  You like your eggs
 a little runny don't you?
  What?
  And your toast set at four,
 with a little bit of butter?
  Yeah!
  Hash browns might
 be a little burnt.


  I like 'em however
 you make 'em, sweetie.


  I just wanted to say
  I'm sorry.


  We all forget just how many
 wonderful things you do.


  Oh
  (gasps)
  (voice-breaking):
 Y-You're making me cry.


  (sobs)
 And best of all,
  you're as hot
 as the day I met you.


  (sobs)
  Thank you!
  That apology speech you wrote
 worked like a charm, Pop.


  Your mother can't resist
 an apology
  that comes
 straight from the heart
  of this box.


  Oh, dear God,
  this is not a
 Renaissance Faire, is it?
  Uh, that's in two weeks,
  Henry the Weight Problem.

 Ha!
  Gee, I don't know if I belong
 here with all this talent.


  (in goofy voice):
 Hey, Reverend.


  Why didn't the dinosaurs
 make it on Noah's Ark?
  (in normal voice):
 Ooh, I give up.


  (in goofy voice):
 Because they didn't exist.


  (laughter)
  Dad, this festival
 encourages experimentation.


  Even failure.


  Oh, what if I don't fail?
  Desperate times call
 for desperate measures.


  I am getting a helium balloon.


  That makes anyone funny.


  (in high helium voice):
 Be right back!
  (Homer retching)
  Homer, are you okay?
  You look exactly like
 Barbara Streisand did in 1967.


  I can't think of anything funny.


  Homer, Homer, relax,
 you're a riot.


  Remember how funny you was when
 you was the confident Cajun?
  Look, just let me
 feed you the prompt.


  Wait, you mean cheat at improv?
  What would Del Close say?
  He would say, "Do like Moe
 says, and shut the hell up.

"
  Who's Del Close?
  Only the author of the best book
 I intend to read someday.


  Homer, the cemeteries
 are filled with people
  who didn't cheat at improv.


  Hmm
  Okay, let's go over what you're
 gonna call out one more time.


  Uh, ethnicity: Cajun.


  Location: back alley.


  Good, good.


  The back alley Cajun bit.


  LISA:
 Dad!
  Are you cheating by
 planting suggestions?
  Maybe.


  (stunned gasp)
  Have you learned nothing
 from owning an unread copy
  of Truth in Comedy?
  It's either that
 or quit the show.


  You can't let
 your troupe down.


  They need your space work,
 your strong choices,
  and scene-building skills.


  Hey, lay off your dad, huh?
  Everything that's
 supposedly spontaneous
  has already been planned, okay?
  Reality shows, uh,
 lip-sync singing, even
  (in dramatic voice):
 awards shows.


  No!
  Yes, that's why the losers
 don't show up.


  B-b-b-but they have
 scheduling conflicts.


  Yeah, right.


  Dave Franco has a
 scheduling conflict.


  No, no, I've heard enough.


  I refuse to use
 performance enhancing "sugs.

"
  AUDIENCE (muttering):
 It's Homer Simpson.


  Homer Simpson's here.


  (audience continues to
 mutter in excitement)
  Okay, everyone,
 I'm Homer Simpson
  and I need an occupation.


  Cadaver salesman?
  Drive-thru cashier.


  Uh, frog gigger.


  Finger kisser! Mwah!
  Nurse.


  You'll have to be more specific.


  I need a nurse!
  Back alley Cajun!
  Mm-hmm!
  Ah
  A father I can look up to.


  Oh.

 Um, uh
  I hear drive-thru cashier!
  BOTH:
 You wha ?
  Hello, welcome to
 "Down and Out Burger"
  Would you like fries with that?
  (laughter)
 A thousand?
  Sure thing, Mr.

 Brando.


  By the way, this is 1992.


  (Homer chuckles,
 audience laughs)
  AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO
 SOMETHING A LITTLE SPECIAL.


  OUR FATHER IS GONNA IMPROV
 LIVE ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FROM
  THE TV AUDIENCE.


 IT ONLY TOOK US 27 YEARS TO DO
  WHAT THEY COULD DO IN 1954.


 HOMER, TIME TO BOMB.


  HELLO!
 I'VE GATHERED YOU HERE BECAUSE I
  HAVE AN IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT.


 THIS IS THE LAST EPISODE OF "THE
  SIMPSONS.

"
 IT'S BEEN A GREAT RUN.


  JUST KIDDING.


 "THE SIMPSONS" WILL NEVER END.


  ON SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE LAS NIGHT, DRAKE WAS TERRIBLE.


  NOW TO TAKE YOUR CALLS.


 LET'S GO TO HANNAH.


  HANNAH, YOU'RE TALKING TO HOMER.


 HI THERE, HOMER.


  MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS WHO DO
 YOU LIKE MORE -- LENNY OR
  CARL -- AND WHY?
 LET'S SEE.


  I LIKE LENNY BECAUSE HE'S THE
 BLACK GUY AND -- WAIT A MINUTE,
  NO.


 CARL'S THE -- WAIT.


  LET ME GET BACK TO YOU WHEN I
 FIGURE OUT WHO'S WHO.


  LET'S GO TO THE NEXT QUESTION.


 AMANDA?
  I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD
 GIVE ME ANY TIPS OR TRIPS FOR
  MAKING IT LOOK LIKE I'M HARD A WORK BUT I'M RELAXING OR TAKING
  A NAP?
 ALWAYS WEAR GLASSES WITH EYES
  GLUED ONTO THEM.


 NEXT QUESTION.


  GEORGE, I THINK.


 HELLO, GEORGE.


  HELLO, HOMER.


 WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION?
  SO MY QUESTION IS
 PIZZA-RELATED.


  PIZZA?
 DO YOU PREFER CHICAGO DEEP
  DISH OR NEW YORK-STYLE?
 LET'S SEE.


  I PREFER CHICAGO DEEP DISH
 BECAUSE I LIKE ITALIAN BETTER
  THAN CHINESE.


 AND NOW LET'S GO TO A PLANTED
  CALL WITH A PLANTED QUESTION.


 LET'S GO TO -- HELLO?
  HOMER, HOW ARE YOU DOING?
 I'M DOING ALL RIGHT.


  IS THAT YOUR QUESTION?
 I WAS WONDERING WHAT KIND OF
  CAR DO YOU DRIVE?
 OH, I DRIVE A HYBRID WHICH IS
  A COMBINATION OF OLD AND
 TERRIBLE.


  NEXT CALLER.


 CHRIS.


  YES, CHRIS.


 WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION?
  OR COMMENT.


 MY QUESTION IS WHAT'S YOUR
  FAVORITE JOB?
 WHAT WAS YOUR FAVORITE JOB?
  MY FAVORITE JOB WOULD HAVE
 BEEN BEING AN ASTRONAUT BECAUSE
  EVERYTHING WAS DONE FOR ME.


 AND ALSO I COULD GET AWAY FROM
  THE BOY.


 WELL, THAT'S IT.


  THAT'S IT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.


  WE HAVE COME TO MY CLOSING
 REMARKS.


  IT ONLY LASTED THREE MINUTES,
  LIKE EATING CHEESEBURGERS AND
 MAKING LOVE.


  IF YOUR CALL HASN'T BEEN TAKEN
  YET, PLEASE CONTINUE TO HOLD.


  THE CAST OF EMPIRE WILL BE
  ANSWERING QUESTIONS WEDNESDAY
 NIGHT.


  SOMEONE WILL LET THEM KNOW.


  FLASHING BY ARE THE CREDITS OF THE
  PEOPLE WHO WORKED LONG AND HARD
 ON THIS.


  I HAVE NO IDEA WHO THEY ARE.


  NOW THE SHOW IS OVER.


  THE SPOTLIGHT DIMS, THE LAUGHTER
 FADES.


  SOMEONE CALL UBER.


  IF BART WOULD JUST RETURN MY
  PANTS SO I CAN MOVE FROM BEHIND
 THIS DESK.


  DOO, DOO, DOO.


  WAITING ON THE PANTS.


  OH, BART, NOT CULOTTES.


  NO.

 LENNY: Quittin' time!
  CARL:
 Quittin' time.


  HOMER:
 Thank God it's Friday.


  LENNY:
 Thursday.


  HOMER:
 Same thing.

 See you Monday.


  Marge, baby, I'm out the door.


  Are you sure?
  Because sometimes people say
 they're out the door
  when they really
 haven't left yet.


  Those people are horrible,
 horrible liars.


  See you soon.


  Simpson, not so fast.


  Hold up one end of this poster.


  Now use it to conceal this.


  (air hissing)
  Excellent.


  Now, let me just
 crank up the plumb bob
  to determine the vertical.


  (crank squeaking)
  (chuckles)
 With this mechanical marvel,
  we'll have this poster
 level in under three hours.


  (chuckles)
  (crank continues squeaking)
 (Homer whimpers)
  Ooh, and for a
 little excitement,
  how about a plumb bob song?
  Uh
 (stammers)
  All right.


 Um
  One must never, never 
  Never rush 
  The plumb bob 
  Slow is the way 
  The only way to go 
  Clear your schedule 
  Before you use the plumb bob 
  Yes, the plumb bob 
  Is mighty, mighty 
  Mighty

 Slow

  MARGE:
 Okay.


  Maggie's had her bath,
  dinner's on the stove.


 Hmm.


  Dare I pop a cork?
  (magical gliss)
  (British accent):
 Give me a spin, Marge.


  You're so deft.


  Not like
 (shudders) him.


  LISA:
 Mom.

 Mom!
  My costume for the
 science play is all wrong!
  You said you were a seahorse.


  A male seahorse.


  With a pouch.


  Males have pouches?
  Male seahorse's nurturing is one
 of the wonders of the world.


  You said you read the script.


  Bart gave me a synopsis.


  I (groans)
  Oh, boy.


  (garage door opening and closing)
 Oh, now what?
  Eat your carrot and pea medley.


  (groans)
  Mom, I'll clean
 that up for you.


  Oh, thank God, some help.


  Where's the mop?
 In the mop closet.


  Where's the bucket?
 Under the mop.


  Other closet.


  There's stuff in front of it.


  (loud groan)
  Let me help.


  (bubbling, fizzing)
 Ay, caramba!
  Hey, there's wood
 underneath this linoleum.


  Oh!
 Just go play outside.


  Outside?
 Your loss.


  (Bart humming happily)
  (children chattering)
  I do not get what kids
 see in these places.

 (humming)
  (clanking)
  It's the genie of the sub.


  Genie? I wish.


  You get a lamp and a carpet,
  which is more than
 I've got in here.


  Hmm, didn't know this place
 was filled with such losers.


  Hey, Martin.


  Bartholomew!
  This playground has safely
 stimulated my imagination.


  What the hell are
 you talking about?
  Martin.


 (chuckles)
  Who's your new friend?
  (whispers):
 Mother, don't blow this for me.


  Fine, I'll just go sit
 and talk to his mother.


  Where is she?
  I'm here by myself.


  But I have a safety number.


 (phone line ringing)
  MOE:
 Moe's Tavern.


  Homer ain't here.


  And for once, that's the truth.


  (keys beeping)
  (siren wailing)
  (tires screech, siren stops)
  Simpson, are you
 here unsupervised?
  Yeah.


 And so what?
  I'd lose the attitude,
 "Sylvester Alone.

"
  (chuckles)
  Finally, a laugh out of Lou.


  Son, kids aren't allowed
 on their own anymore.


  Now, who said you
 could come here?
  My mom.


  Ugh.


 Always the mom.


  (siren wailing)
  (Flanders yells,
 tires screech)
  (grunting)
  (screams)
  She's got needles.


  (clicking)
  (exhales)
 What did Bart do now?
  I was playing
 nicely in the park.


  Bart, how could you What?
  Your children
 need to be supervised.


  Take her away, boys.


  If you take me away, then
 who's gonna watch my kids?
  You should've thought of that
  before we showed up
 unannounced.


  What, Marge?
  You're being arrested?
  I'm afraid so, Mr.

 Simpson.


  A mother at the park saw
 something she disapproved of.


  And luckily for your son,
 she overreacted.


    I, uh
 I get carsick in the front.


  (Wiggum chuckles)
  Our top story,
 a Springfield mother
  has been arrested for
 an outrageous "negligÃ©e.

"
  The
  Sorry, I'm being told
 it's negligence.


  Which is very boring.


  Judge, I don't understand.


  When I was a kid,
 we used to go out and play
  and not come home until dark.


  I see.


  Bailiff, incarcerate
 Marge Simpsons' mother.


  (squeaks)
  Thanks for
 ratting me out, Marge
  (muffled talking)
  With all due respect, Judge,
  this is wackadoodle.


  Nobody cares about
 their kids more than I do.


  Liar.


  Marge is right, Your Honor.


  My e-mail password
 is "bad dad.

"
  (gallery gasps)
 Yeah, Judge.


  If you wanna know
 who should be in jail,
  he weighs 240
 and smells like onions.


  It is not within
 the purview of this court
  to determine how fat
 and smelly your father may be.


  Woo-hoo!
  Mrs.

 Simpsons, 90 days.


  (gavel bangs)
 (gasps)
  This is Kafkaesque.


  Kafkaesque!
  I've got my eye on you.


  Now it's Orwellian.


  (hinges squeaking)
  Hey, kitties.


  You got a new
 ball of yarn.


  (hinges squeak,
 door slams)
  Oh, that guard
 is awfully slammy.


  Newbies on top.


  Oh.


 Where's the ladder?
  Have you been claimed yet?
  Claimed?
  By one of the book clubs.


  (sighs)
  Yeah, we read
 a little, dig a little,
  read a little, dig a little,
  kiss a little,
 dig a little.


  (groans)
  (birds chirping)
  Homer, I think you're supposed
 to cook sausage.


  What's the point?
  (knocking on door)
  Well, hi there, Homer.


  I know a time like this is when
 a man really needs his neighbor.


  Yeah, well,
 thanks for the check-in.


  (chuckles) Well, this is
 more than a check-in.


  It's a chance to do good
 for us boys in the hood!
  Just call us NWA,
  "Neighbors With Appetizers.

"
  (sobbing)
  Wow, wow.


  I really am
 the richest man in town.


  Not rich in money,
  but in what really matters:
 pity.


  And what happened to Marge
 is a wake up call for us all.


  There's no greater crime
 than half-assed parenting.


  Kirk, where's Milhouse?
  On the leash, baby.


 On the leash.


  He's too far.


  Retract.


 Retract!
  Whoa!
 Why'd you pull me back?
  Some new kids were just
 about to give me a chance.


  Don't try anything new, son.


  I could've married a woman
 who didn't look exactly like me.


  (chuckling):
 But that would've been crazy.


  (door slams shut)
  Hey, newbie.


  Nobody touches
 the new James Patterson
  until Solar reads it first.


  (moans, yelps)
  She wants you
 to pick it up.


  (laughter) You scared, huh?
 (clucking)
  (sighs)
  (grumbling)
  (growling)
  (gasping)
 Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

 Whoa.


  Anybody else want a
 taste of Blue Thunder?
  Uh, I do.

 Yeah.


 (grunts)
  Now, if you ladies
 recall what this place
  is supposed
 to be for
  Mm Mm
 Smokin' weed?
  Reading!
  (sighs)
  (chewing sounds)
  Dad, if this is what they send
 when Mom goes to jail,
  just imagine what happens
 when you kick the bucket.

 (burps)
  Oh, man, that's gonna
 be so awesome.


  Dad, Dad! You're
 eating a teddy bear!
  That's
 my stomach's problem.


  Okay, Homer, I just changed
 all the linens,
  diapered the dog
 for modesty,
  and replaced the batteries
 in the smoke detectors,
  which were all bad.


  One was just a candy dish
 with a red light painted on.


  Was there any candy in it?
  There is now.


  (laughs)
 Oh, Flanders.


  It turns out there's
 a good side to you after all.


  Well, sir, maybe I know a little
 bit about what it's like
  to lose the lady of the house.


 (sniffles)
  Oh, I think I heard
 a dryer ding.


  Thank you, Mr.

 Flanders.


  Tell your boys
 I wanna hang.


  Flanders is great.


  I've always said that.


  But we can't forget your mother.


  (shuddering): Oh
    MARGE:
 Oh, my first prison flower.


  Can it be? Am I starting
 to like it in here?
  Exercise time!
  Ooh.


  I never have time
 to exercise.


  Is this a prison or a spa?
  Aah! It's a prison.


 (grunts)
  (birds chirping)
 (munching sounds)
  (munching continues)
  Hey, uh, are there any more
 chocolate chip muffins?
  Sorry, Dad.

 The only ones left
 have caraway seeds.


  Oh.

 I miss your mother
 so much.


  Shockingly, these gift baskets
 haven't solved anything.


  Wait, Dad.

 That one that
 looks like blueberry
  actually has M&amp;M'S.


  Oh.

 Oh, thank God.


 Everything's okay.


  But for how long?
  LISA:
 Mom, I really, really miss you.


  Also, I have a field trip form
  that needs to be signed
 for school.


  I think if I mail it to you
 at the prison it's still
  easier than getting it from Dad.


  BART:
 I wanna talk to Mom.


  Can you send me a shiv
 for show and tell?
  Preferably with blood on it.


  Hey, give me the phone.


 (grunts)
  Are my blue pants done
 at the prison laundry?
  Remember to sign my form.


  Shiv with blood.


  Press my pants.


 (dial tone)
  (gasps)
 The electric chair.


  And then he thought it was
 the electric chair.


  (all laughing)
  8:00.


 Lights out.


  Really? 8:00?
 I get to go to bed?
  I don't have to clean
 a sink full of dishes,
  or write a paragraph with
 topic sentence for Homer?
  (sighs heavily)
  Aw, you're tired too.


  Everyone goes to sleep
 so easily here.


  Marge, your positivity
 is contagious.


  I'm starting to believe
 I really will show everyone.


  Simpson, you
 got a visitor.


  Oh, gee, now?
 It's a shame to go inside.


  Okay, let's
 move in the body now.


  (groaning sigh)
  Marge, I got great news.


  We hired the one
 good lawyer in town.


  Yes, Mrs.

 Simpson, I got
 you off on a technicality.


  Since your husband never
 filed for a birth certificate,
  Bart isn't
 legally your son.


  Mm? Mm?
  How about that?
  Why aren't you
 saying anything, Marge?
  You're free.

 Free.


  Now, it's not the world
 you remember.


  The girl at the coffee place
 that left?
  Came back.


  So you'll have that
 to get used to.


  I'm free?
  Oh, and just in time.


  Bart's claiming
 he's in another dimension,
  but I think he's just
 hiding in the closet.


  I had 90 days.


  I was promised 90 days.


  Now you have to give me
 more time.


  (stammers)
 Oh, no you don't.


  I can't go to another
 school meeting.


  I can't!
  Everyone just asks about
 their own kid.


  Hey, you like shopping?
 'Cause you just
  bought yourself
 two more months.


  (cackles)
  Sorry, Homie.


 I can't go back yet.


  Just tell me where the soap
 for the dishwasher goes
  and how do I
 (lock clicks)
  (sighs heavily)
  Marge would rather stay in
 prison than come home to me.


  I have to reexamine
 my entire life.


  Yeah, maybe you can start by not
 bringing your kids to the bar.


  (slurping)
  Yeah, it's kind of funny-- Homer
 takes his kids to a saloon,
  but Marge is in jail
 for being a bad parent.


  I guess somebody up there
 likes me.


  Do you like him?
  Uh, not really, no.


  I've gotta change, show Marge
 I can help around the house.


  More than just turning up
 the TV when she vacuums.


  I've gotta become
 the perfect homemaker.


  (phone ringing)
    (laughs)
  (giggling)
  Oh
  (gulping)
  (phone rings)
  Oh, I was doing so great,
  but it turned out
 I was a secret alcoholic.


  Yeah, good thing
 it's just your imagination.


  (gulping)
  Oh, yeah.


  When we said we'd take turns
 watching all the kids,
  I never thought
 it would be my turn.


  (humming) Why did I get
 the choke chain?
  Go around
 this side of the tree.


  This side of the tree.


 This side of the tree!
  No, Ralph.

 No!
 (humming)
  (giggles)
 Hi, Mr.

 Bobcat.


  (bobcat growls)
  You're in charge, boy.


  (grunting)
  (bobcat growling)
 Now, listen, bobcat.


  (Homer screaming)
  Are you as sick as I am
 of having grown-ups
  everywhere you go?
 (others agreeing)
  I say we sneak off to the park
 and have fun by ourselves.


  Great idea.


 I'll text my mom.


  (gasps) My Jitterbug

  Homer, what are you
 doing here?
  I had to do whatever it
 takes to get you to leave.


  So I dressed up as
 a prison guard.


  Now I'd better not
 blow my cover.


  Get back.

 Get back.


  Okay, a little forward.


  Now back! Back! Back!
 (blows landing)
  Now forward.


  And back! Back! Back!
 (blows landing)
  It's very sweet
 that you came for me.


  I know things won't always
 be perfect-- (grunts)--

 fighting off prison inmates
  in a tornado.


 (grunts)
  I believe you.


  And I wanna go home.


    Mwah.

  No, I can't.

 some extra bacon?
  Sure would, Mom.


  Okay, but you owe me.


  Sorry, sorry,

  It's okay, Mom.

 Whatever you
 want, just glad you're back.


  Geez, ever since I got sprung

  you kids have been
 kind of clingy.


  No, Mom, we're just really
 glad to have you back.


  And we're not nuts or
 anything, but please

  I'm coming, too.


  Oh, you're pathetic.

 he's wearing, sir.


  If I may ask, what makes
 this device so enchanting
  that you ignore the real world?
  Is there a milkmaid skipping rope?
  Oi! Gloivick!
  The Oculus Frink or Froculus
  provides you with a complete
 virtual reality experience.


  (GROANS) Letting you live
 in a world of your dreams.


  Goi!
  (MUTTERS)
  To adjust the focus, turn
 the dial on the side.

 Oi.


  Now for the after-party!
  (LIVELY ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING)
  I must have it!
  Oh, uh, can you drop me off first?
    Hmm, not bad.

 Next?
  This is still a new technology, sir.


  At the moment, it's really
 just lots of pornography,
  a roller coaster,
 pornography, pornography,
  Burger King ad, pornography,
  and and this one.


    (DRAGON SQUAWKS)
  (ROARING)
  (SQUAWKS)
  Dragon porn.


  (BOTH MOANING)
  Oh, yeah.


  - Oh, yeah.

 Oh.


 - Oh, flame on, baby.


  Flame on!
  Hot! Hot!
  Don't tell my wife, okay?
  SMITHERS: Oh, sorry, sir.


  This one is also pornography.


  Oh, so boring.


  (FABRIC RIPS)
  Trim those nails, Smithers.


  Uh, sir, if I might suggest,
  the last thing your therapist said was,
  "You need a family.

"
  (CHUCKLES): I don't need anyone.


  We could program a virtual
 family for you, sir.


  A virtual family.

 Yes.


  Meanwhile, let me see the one again
  where I shoot the
 beloved lion in Africa.


  That was reality, sir.


  Mm.

 I've lived quite the life.


  Quite the life.


  Ooh!
  (CROW CAWS)
  Uh, we only need three children, thanks.


  Oh, what kind of coal mine you runnin'?
  You, wife, look at me lovingly,
 as if I'm your husband.


  Eh, can you ask for a
 look of indifference?
  I think she can do that.


  Luann, pretend it's my birthday.


  Next.


  You promised me a job, Dad!
  I was gonna buy a fat Barbie.


  It's Curvy Barbie.


  And that would mean you have
 to buy all new clothes.


  (CROW CAWS)
  Uh, this thing says all
 families in the plant
  are required to try out.


  So far, so good.


  Two-and-a-half children,
 wife with current hairstyle.


  You're all hired.


  Except you, fatso.

 We
 don't need a father.


  I'll be the rooster in this henhouse.


  That is so disappointing.


  I've always wanted to work for Mr.


 Burns.


  Okay, family scene.


  And action.


  (STEAM HISSING)
  (SUCKING NOISES)
  This isn't a word I use lightly, but
 excellent.


  Oh, Smithers, one favor:
  make the children look
 like they're mine.


  No, no, no! It's too beautiful.


  Like a Supreme Court full of Scalias.


  Switch to something else.


  BURNS: That's good.


  What's the matter, Homer?
  Last night, Marge and the kids
  didn't get home till 11:00 at night.


  When I came back from Moe's at 11:05,
  they were still taking off their coats!
  I hear old man Burns is just
 living in a fantasy world now.


  En garde! (LAUGHS)
  Mm, must be nice.


  Hey, there he is.

 Wonder
 what he's watching now.


  Home movies.


  Happy birthday, dear Burnsie 
  Happy birthday to you 
  And maybe more.

 
  (CHUCKLES) Thank you, thank you.


  Now, your mother's going
 to take me upstairs
  to give me her present.


  (MARGE MOANING SUGGESTIVELY)
  BURNS: Oh, Smithers, could
 you remove the ankle bar?
  More.

 More.

 More.


  (MOANS) Oh
  (CHUCKLES): Oh, that was wonderful.


  I'm picking up your ten-year options.


  Ten years?!
  Oh, now, now, no discussion.


  We're a family now.


  Ugh! What is that? A river otter?
  (DOG HOWLS)
  (GROANS) We're not coming home, Homie.


  What? What do I do without you here?
  You can do what you did
 with me there: go to Moe's.


  Aw, it's not the same
  if I'm not trying to avoid
 some unpleasant chore.


  Oh.

 You could clean out the attic.


  - Going to Moe's!
 - (LINE CLICKS, DIAL TONE)
  Eh, no one to go home to, huh?
  Yeah, take it from me, that's rough.


  Yeah.


  Heading back to an empty house.


  No one there to tell you what to do,
  no kids fighting all the time.


  Wait a minute.


  I can eat dinner in any
 room of the house!
  And not the scary ones like the
 basement and Bart's bedroom.


  And I can drink at home!
  Whoa, whoa! You're
 twisting my words there.


  That would be cheaper! And
 I wouldn't have to drive!
  And you are kind of mean.


  No one calls me mean.


  Moe, you're proving my point.


  Here we are talking, and
 you pull a shotgun on me.


  But there's never any
 bullets in this.

 Watch.


  Ha! Good gag, huh?
  Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp-bomp-bomp 
  Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp-bomp-bomp 
  I feel free 
  Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp-bomp-bomp 
  I feel free 
  (MUFFLED EXPLOSION)
  I feel free 
  Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp-bomp-bomp 
  I feel free 
  Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp-bomp-bomp 
  I feel free 
  Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp-bomp-bomp 
  I feel free 
  Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp-bomp-bomp 
  I feel free 
  Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp-bomp-bomp 
  I feel free 
  Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp-bomp-bomp 
  I feel free 
  Feel when I dance with you 
  We move like the sea 
  You, you're all I want to know 
  I feel free 
  I feel free.

 
  Mmm, does that turn you on?
  Oh, yes.

 That's hot.


  (HANDLES CREAK)
  (LAUGHS) The perfect temperature.


  (OWL HOOTING)
  Ah, Snoopy knew what he
 was doing, all right.


  - WOMAN: How you doing?
 - Aah!
  Don't worry, I've seen you
 naked plenty of times.


  I live in the house behind yours.


  I don't think my wife would like this.


  Hey, I got a boyfriend,
 and you're not my type.


  FLANDERS: Could you both keep it down?
  I'm trying to count pennies.


  (SCOFFS) Stupid Flanders.


  FLANDERS: Oh! You made me lose count.


  (BOTH LAUGHING)
  Homer, it looks like
 you're out of beer, pal.


  (GRUNTS)
  Wow, can a man just be friends
  with a woman?
  Here are some pretzels.


  Yes, he can!
  Aw, don't worry.

 I'll fix that.


  Have one.

 I'm celebrating.


  My boyfriend proposed.


  Wow! You'll get to enjoy
  the most magical part of
 married life: the beginning.


  - Mmm
 - (SLURPING)
  So, uh, where's the lucky guy?
  (SIGHS) Gone for the weekend.


  He's an airline pilot.


  Maybe he and I can go out for beers
  - before a flight.


 - Mm.


  Where's your wife?
  Uh, she's staying at this
 billionaire's house,
  working as a virtual reality actress.


  You know, the usual.


  Oh, Homer?
  Something's going on with Homer.


  My spousal sense is tingling.


  Mom, you blew the take!
  Okay, that's it.

 I'll direct.


  And I'll show you how a pro does it.


  You, daughter character,
 say you love me.


  (FLATLY): I love you.


  Like you mean it.


  (FLATLY): I really love you.


  Once more, with feeling.


  (FLATLY): I really
  love you.


  Blech.


  This girl has no chops whatsoever.


  (A LA KATHERINE HEPBURN):
 The existence of my chops
  is not for the likes of yo
 to ascertain, my good sir.


  (SHUDDERS) Would you like some eggs
  with that ham?
  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.


  Looks like the old make-out king's
  got a new queen, huh?
  Guys, we're just friends.


  It's purely catatonic.


  "Platonic.

"
  That means she's into me,
  but I'm keeping it cool.


  I like you, but that's
 not what it means.


  Sure, right.


  (ITALIAN ACCENT): Here you
 go, the antipasto, to share.


  BOTH: Ooh!
  Would you fellas like to join us?
  (NERVOUS STAMMERS)
  (SOPHISTICATED ACCENT): When
 did salad get so awful?
  (SOPHISTICATED ACCENT):
 Kale ruined everything.


  (MOCK SOPHISTICATED LAUGHTER)
  (NORMAL VOICE): You're just like a guy.


  You're funny, you like to eat crap.


  If I may get personal,
  - what's your bowling average?
 - 212.


  Oh, my God, you're my best friend!
  And that's all.

 Just friends.


  Eh, we shall see.


  There is one test for
 a-romance that never fails.


  Enjoy it.


  That is not a-love!
  This is the best we're friends,
 no one has any reason to get upset,
  and no one gets hurt.


  To no one getting hurt.


  SMITHERS: Smash-cut to Marge!
  "Look, Monty, our
 daughter, the president,
  is delivering her speech.

"
  Excuse me, do I ever get a joke?
  Keep rolling.


  "Mr.

 Vice President, Madam Speaker,
  "Chinese Overlords,
  years ago, our forefathers,
 and foremothers"
  BURNS: Stick to the script!
  Oh, you try to give direction
 to a bunch of land apes
  who aren't worth the ping-pong balls
 stuck to their untalented asses!
  Idiots! Mountebanks!
  Featherwits! Poltroons!
  (FURNITURE CRASHES)
  Saint Francis himself
 would vomit with rage!
  Okay, you heard him, people.


  That was great, just a
 little more energy.


  Sir, I know you're getting frustrated,
 so we recorded some future scenarios.


  Yes, let's see what life
 will be like when I'm old.


  I'm going to build
 homes for the homeless
  with my boyfriend Sean, then
 it's off to Vassar in the fall.


  Irish boyfriend? Helping the homeless?
  Well, every family has one black sheep.


  Let's move on.


  - How did this happen?
 - (PACIFIER POPS TWICE)
  Don't you take that tone with me.


  A Harvard man?
  I was warned there'd be nausea.


  I don't need them.

 My life is perfect.


  My life is perfect.


  49, 50.

 My life is perfect!
  Have you seen my Canadian penny?
  Oh, darn it, darn it, darn it!
  Everyone out! You're all fired!
  Having a family is the most
 meaningless experience
  I could imagine.


  Try acting.


  Mm
  Come on, kids.


  I'm taking my bathrobe.


  There's a dye pack stitched in.


  (LOUD POP)
  Joke's on you.

 I like this better.


  Oh, go ahead, take your robe.


  But you'll never work in single-viewer
 virtual reality family melodrama again.


  Did you see the guitar lessons
 sign on the telephone pole?
  I took a tab.


  No, I'm not gonna take the lessons,
 I just needed to blow my nose.


  Ooh, my family's here.

 Gotta go.


  Hey, guys! It's good to see you.


  Hmm.

 Good to see you.

 Who
 were you talking to?
  My friend Julia.


  -Julia? Like a girl?
 - She's not a girl.


  She's three years younger
 than your mother.


  (IRRITATED MURMUR)
  Now, Marge, it's cool.


  All we do is share our deepest
 thoughts and feelings.


  Mm-hmm.


  Kids, could you leave the room, please?
  Faster!
  Geronimo!
  (RETREATING FOOTSTEPS)
  Marge, it's nothing.

 She's
 just my new best friend.


  (GROANS ANGRILY)
  What the Why Why are
 you mad at those eggs?!
  They didn't do anything!
  - Homer Simpson!
 - (WHIMPERING)
  After all I've put up
 with for all these years,
  if I'm not your best friend,
 what is this marriage about?!
  Okay, okay, you're my best friend.


  She's just somebody I
 call when I'm mad at you.


  - (SCREAMS)
 - (GRUMBLING)
  I mean, I'm never mad at you.


  Well, sometimes I'm mad at you.


  A little bit! But I shouldn't call her.


  - I should just drink it off at Moe's.


 - (GROWLING)
  You'll never hear the name Julia again.


  - Hi, I'm Julia.


 - Neh!
  I just wanted to introduce myself and
 tell you you've got a great husband.


  I've got a nice bicycle, too,
 but I keep a lock on it.


  I have no interest in
 riding your bike.


  But I want you to know
 that your bike loves you
  as truly as a bike can.


  And, Marge, I love you
 as much as that bike.


  - You are the bike.


 - (GASPS) Wha?!
  (DOOR CREAKS)
  I'm-I'm sorry.

 I'm sorry.


  Apparently, you didn't
 do anything wrong.


  But I'm not wrong for
 getting mad at you either.


  Marge, Julia taught me lots
 of stuff that could help us.


  For example, I realize
 that when you see me
  doing something stupid and you don't
 say anything about it, you know,
  and you're just being nice.


  - That's true.


 - And when something's bothering you,
  sometimes I should just say, "I
 understand," instead of trying to fix it.


  Because all you really need is
 someone to know what you're feeling.


  That is really, really lovely.


  (BOTH MOANING)
  I have to confess, I did
 see him naked on the roof.


  I did, too, and I was at 10,000 feet.


  Now for the final fantasy.


  (CRYING)
  (GASPS) Oh, my love, my love,
  losing you so young, so beautiful.


  Still no jokes.


  (FLATLY): I love you, and how.


  (SOBS) You're too good for heaven, man.


  (CHUCKLES) Excellent.


  (CREATURES SQUAWKING)
  (EERIE SHRIEK)
  Welcome, Monty.


  I'd like to take a selfie with you.


  All right, but just one.


  Hmm, it's not plugged in.

 HOMER: Come on, Marge, where's dinner?
  What's the holdup in there?
  (TO "CHARGE" FANFARE):
 Pot-pop-pot-pot pot pies! 
  A pie for Bart
  - Come on, put them down already.


 - a veggie pie for Lisa
  - Why do you have to describe everything?
 - a baby pie for Maggie.


  The pies know who they're for.


  - A dog pie for Santa's Little Helper.


 - What? The dog
  The dog before me?
  Now, be sure to cut it open first
 so the pie has time to cool.


  (SCREAMS) I'm done.


  I know you're in a hurry to go
 to the bar to watch football,
  but first I want you to
 put the kids to bed.


  (GROANS LOUDLY)
  (STRAINS, GRUNTS)
  "Everything after the tornado
 was a dream.

 The end.

"
  (TIRES SCREECH)
  ANNOUNCER: Going into halftime, it's
 Springfield Atoms 7, Boston Americans 10.


  Oh, come on, we cannot lose again
 to those no-good Boston cheaters!
  I-I can't stand that
 pretty-boy quarterback.


  Thinks he's so handsome,
 just 'cause he's drop-dead gorgeous.


  The only Boston wins
 is because they cheat!
  Listening in on our teams' headsets,
 fattening our cheerleaders.


  You know, for three games last year,
 Boston used a volleyball painted brown.


  (BOSTON ACCENT): That was never proven,
 you Springfield screw-job.


  Ugh, Boston fans.


  In town for the Dennis
 Lehane book tour.


  Go kiss a Kennedy, you rule-
 breaking cranberry squeezers!
  We don't cheat.


  We won 12 division titles in ten years,
 fair and square.


  You dorks are just jealous of
 all our championship rings.


  ALL: Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!
  You're the one who's jealous.


  I only wish I could
 be as jealous as you.


  Geez, Jay, this place has got
 more knobs than a hardware store.


  I hate this town.


  So don't I.

 Friggin' doorknobs.


  (LAUGHTER) Automatic.


  BOTH: Mwah, mwah, mwah.


  ANNOUNCER: It's fourth and long, the
 Americans' last chance for a miracle.


  Come on, Springfield, put it away!
  We're gonna win one.

 We're
 finally gonna win one!
  ANNOUNCER: The QB
 handsomely takes the snap,
  sexily steps back to pass, and with
 God-given good looks, fires it downfield!
  But there's no one there to receive it!
  (GROANING)
  (SCOFFS) Nice pass.


  What a first-ballot hall-of-fame loser.


  ANNOUNCER: But the ball is caught by the
 Americans' mascot, Flappy the Flag!
  Flappy running unopposed
 into the end zone
  for a surely illegal touchdown.


  Throwing to the mascot?
  After further review,
 Flappy the Flag is listed
  on the Americans' 53-man
 roster and reported eligible.


  The result of the play is a touchdown.


  (CROWD CHEERING)
  ANNOUNCER: Once again, the Americans
 found a way to win.


  (CHUCKLES) Oh, that'll put a smile
 on Coach Bonderchuck's face.


  (CROWD CHEERING)
  - (CHEERING)
 - Oh, not again!
  They cheated! You cheated!
  Did not.

 You got to cover the mascot.


  Use your noggin.

 Play smart.


  Flappy's on the roster.


  (CHANTING): On the roster!
  - On the roster!
 - On the roster!
  On the roster, my butt.


  Once again, those Boston cheaters
 think the rules don't apply to them.


  And they're so smug about winning.


  If I ever won anything, I
 wouldn't be smug about it.


  I'd be class all the way, like Mark
 Harmon pure American elegance.


  I tell ya, the next Boston fan I see,
 I'm just gonna lose it.


  Lose it so hard.


  And What the
  What is How could
  That hat! Your head!
  That team.


  My son!
  Hey, Dad, caught the game last night.


  Tough loss for your guys.


  Guess we just wanted it more.


  (SARCASTICALLY): Oh, am
 I in the right house?
  Because no one in my house
  would ever be caught dead
 wearing Boston Americans gear.


  Dead!
  I feel ya, Homer.


  Sucks to be a loser.


  Unlike the six-time Mega-Bowl champion
 Boston Americans.


  Mwah! (SMOOCHES)
  Ring, ring, ring.


  (FRUSTRATED GRUNTS)
  Give me that hat.


  (GROWLS)
  (GRUNTING, SNORTING)
  OlÃ©!
  (SIGHS) Your father never
 could resist an "olÃ©.

"
  Eh, he'll run out of steam soon.


  (HOMER GROANING)
  (LAUGHTER)
  Get in.


  (MILHOUSE AND NELSON SCREAM)
  (GULPS)
  Look around, son.


  This is your hometown.


  And the Springfield Atoms
 are your hometown team
  since 2003, when we stole them
  in the middle of the
 night from Portland.


  What kind of life can you have here
 as a Boston fan?
  See?
  Why are you wearing that Boston hat?
  This is Atoms country, bro!
  I would pluck out my own eyes
 if I did not have a call-back
  for a Web-only Olive Garden commercial.


  They're just trying to hat shame me.


  Face it, Dad, Boston is the
 Bart Simpson of cities.


  All those awesome Southies in The
 Departed, (CHUCKLES) those are my people.


  People? The dog and the
 baby are your people.


  (SIGHS) It all goes back
 to the Boston Tea Party,
  a prank so kick-ass
 it started a country.


  (TIRES SCREECH)
  Come on, pal, what do you say?
  Just lose the hat, for your old man.


  Nope, I think I'll stick
 with the bad boys.


  Get it off before God sees.


  (WHIMPERING)
  (GROANS): Oh!
  And the people from
 Boston are so obnoxious.


  They think their stupid city
 has the best everything:
  bands, comedians, chowder,
  their so-called cream pies,
 which are actually cakes.


  - And there's
 - Why don't you let me
  - take your mind off your problems?
 - And what's with Aerosmith?
  That's not how you spell "arrow.

"
  The Oh.


  (BOTH MOANING)
  (CONFUSED GRUNTING)
  (WHIMPERING)
  Do your job, Homer.


  (HOMER SCREAMS)
  Bart, you're my son.


  There's no neck tattoo so crass,
 no gender reassignment too ambiguous
  that I would not love you.


  Which is why I must show you
 the error of your ways,
  even if it means dragging this
 family all the way to hell.


  A vacation to Boston?
  No, not a vay-cation, a hate-cation!
  Where you experience the worst a place
 has to offer, and then say, "Told ya!"
  Hate-watching, hate-voting
 and now a hate-cation?
  Why can't everyone just
 enjoy things they like?
  Because things you like don't fill you
 with delicious, delicious rage.


  Hmm, I'm gonna love this trip.


  I'm gonna love it right in your face.


  That's it, build it up in your head.


  High hopes just make the
 hate-cation stronger.


  You're crazy.


 Boston can't be that bad.


  (HORNS HONKING)
  I've never loved hating
 anything so much!
  Move your garbage car!
  I got to get to the packy
 before the B's drop puck!
  Told ya!
  See, boy? Notice how Bostonians
 aren't exactly ugly,
  but they're not sexy either.


  Homer, your negative attitude
 is ruining this hate-cation.


  So, what to hate first?
 The Freedom Trail?
  The touch tank at the
 New England Aquarium?
  Ooh, that could blow.


  I want to go to Southie.


  That part of town has the
 towniest townies of any town.


  (SCOFFS) You think your
 Bostonians are so great?
  Watch as your beloved hooligans
  tear your innocent
 father limb from limb
  with just the slightest provocation.


  Listen up, you
 clam-gargling tea-tossers!
  Fenway is a terrible ballpark!
  Dad, don't!
  Out of my way, ladies.


 You're blocking my shot.


  The seats at Fenway Park are too narrow,
 and many of them face center field!
  It's not charming, it's a teardown!
  (BOSTON ACCENT): The bobbleheads!
  They're tippin'!
  (BOSTON ACCENT): Kid, mind the cart!
  - The what?
 - The cart!
  The cot?
  Cot!
  (GRUNTING)
  No, don't struggle!
  It only makes them bobble harder.


  They keep coming.


 Bobblehead Steven Wright,
  bobblehead Aimee Mann,
 bobblehead Bell Biv Devoe!
  The vibrations are killing him!
  Don't worry, sweetheart, I'm a doctor.


  I'm also a doctor, kid.


  (GROANING)
  Mm, so many doctors.


  He's got a Pedro lodged in his airway.


  (HOMER GASPS)
  He'll be fine, ma'am.


  And because of our state's
 super-socialized health care,
  no matter how much your
 husband abuses his body,
  someone else will pay for it.


  What a relief for women
 with hot-tempered,
  accident-prone husbands.


  Oh, yeah, we got a
 whole surgical center
  for injuries from falling
 off icy roofs and gutters.


  BOTH: Ooh.


  While the doctors pull tiny
 Bruins helmets out of your skin,
  Lisa and I are going to
 explore The Hub on our own.


  Remember, this is a hate-cation.


  You better go someplace bad.


  Isn't Mayor Quimby from
 somewhere around here?
  (ALL MUTTERING WITH THICK ACCENTS)
  People are so fit here.


  Everyone looks like they're
 in a financial services ad.


  Free sunscreen? So progressive.


  Do you vaccinate your children?
  Of course.


  But not stupid progressive.


  - (LOW BUZZING)
 - What's that buzzing noise?
  (GASPS) It's-it's nerds!
  They've got every
 recognized species of nerd!
  A jester-hatted ferret preener!
  A Wild West-afarian!
  A Magic: The Gathering gathering!
  Oculus rifters!
  Yo-yo guys.

 Yo-yo girls!
  A chain mail ping pong player.


  (GIGGLES, SQUEALS)
  So much education.


  If they did a Real Housewives
 here, it would be a total snooze.


  Ah, it's like heaven for people
 who don't believe in heaven.


  HOMER: What the crap is this BS?
  What? I thought you'd want
 to try candlepin bowling.


  Hey, McCarthy, nice half-Worcester.


  Get bent, McDonald.


  A lot of wood to work with out there.


  (SPUTTERS) Boston.


  They even found a way
 to mess up bowling.


  Just try it.


  (GROANS)
  Eh, all right.


  (GRUNTS)
  None of the usual pain

  This is candlepin bowling.


  You get three.


  Hmm? Hmm.


  (GRUNTS)
  (GASPS) Three balls.


  I see it all so clearly now.


  What, Dad? What is it?
  This regional bowling
 with its one extra roll
  has knocked my misguided
 hate into the gutter.


  Mwah!
  I like Boston!
  Dad, you and me are real
 father-son Southies, now.


  Just like Ben and Casey Affleck.


  Son, show me everything
 this town has to offer.

  You know, for a cake,

  Look at them.

 So innocent.


  Not Bart, but go on.


  Homer,
  I never dared dream
 about living somewhere
  that values education,
 with great health care,
  and everyone's outdoorsy
  but still pallid.


  If it weren't crazy,
  I'd say we should be
 raising our kids here.


  But no.

 No, no.

 That's crazy!
  Is it?
  (GASPS) But I never thought
 you, of all people
  Honey, this could be the chance
 we never thought we'd get.


  The chance to knock down
 all of life's pins.


  Are you saying what I
 think you're saying?
  I am.

 Fate is offering us a third ball.


  Do you mean it? Are we
 going to move to Boston?
  I knew I didn't pay this
 month's mortgage for a reason.


  (BOTH SIGH)
  (KISSES)
  We did it! We really did it!
 We made a life change.


  I love these colonial

  Now, I can take a nap standing up.


  Check it out, kid.


  This movie's my life now.


  You want to rob the Harvard Coop?
  Why don't we just break into Fort Knox?
  These snobs think Mass Ave.


 belongs to them.


  It's our Ave.


  Whoa! I got to get one of
 those "X" necklaces to kiss.


  This is all happening so fast.


  Can we really afford to live in a city
  with a symphony and a Pops?
  (LAUGHING): Don't worry, baby.


  I have a line on a sweet
 safety inspector gig.


  Very sweet.


  HOMER: Can I get a test on batch six?
  I'm finally living my dream
  of never not being
 around batches of candy.


  And unlike the nuclear plant,
  if I screw up, no one gets hurt.


  (SCREAMING)
  Are you sure we have
 to go to school here?
  I sort of thought I'd go
 straight to running numbers
  for the Irish mob.


  Our school is in the heart
 of what they once called
  The Combat Zone.


  The Combat Zone! Yes!
  Combat rules!
  BART: Charter what?
  Here's my classroom.


  The teacher is Doris Kearns Goodwin.


  Today, we explore Lincoln's 1861
 suspension of habeas corpus,
  using dried macaroni and pipe cleaners.

  Huh, now to get sent to detention.


  That's where I'll meet my

  These are the bad kids?
  There's not a Wahlberg in the bunch.


  I've never felt more like I fit in.

 this is a town not for you, but for me.


  (SCREAMING)
  Hey, but what about Grampa?
  He lives a thousand miles away.


  Great point.


  Nobody tell him where we went.


  Bart, you haven't
 touched your clambake.


  What's wrong?
  This place is all P.

 brainiacs and Subaru owners
  wearing fleece vests.


  It's nothing at all like The Departed.


  Oh, honey, I know it's a big change.


  But someday you'll understand
 that providing our family
  with a better life
  Something I've never been able to do.


  is the most important
 thing in the world.


  We've been given a third ball.


  Let's not throw it away.


  (GROANS)

  No one likes feeling out of place.


  That's how I felt back in Springfield.

  Ginger, cayenne Wicked cleanse, pal.


  Come on.

 Donny, Tommy,
  these solar laptops for Rwandans
  ain't gonna donate themselves.


  It's time for me to ship out of Boston.


  What a gorgeous day.


  I hope it never ends.


  So don't I.


  You know, guys, I've picked out
 the perfect Boston activity
  to help celebrate our move.


  (MARCHING BAND PLAYING)
  Ooh, a parade.


  Not just any parade.


  HOMER: The Boston Americans?
  CROWD (CHANTING): Bonk! Bonk! Bonk!
  It's a state holiday because the league
  overturned the coach's suspension
  for using magnets to
 affect the coin toss.


  Pretty cool way to celebrate
 our new hometown.


  Right, Dad?
  (FORCED): As a Bostonian, I
 definitely support my team.


  Hey, Bonk! Can we get a picture?
  Hell to the derrr, little bro!
  (GRUNTING)
  Come on, Homer, put on the hat.


  I can support my hometown team
 without putting on a hat.


  Hats go on your head!
  If you're gonna live in Boston,
 you got to wear the hat.


  (WINCES)
  Okay.


  (GRUNTING, BLOWING)
  You did this on purpose.


  My future is at stake.


  So don't is mine.


  (STRUGGLING): Just a hat.


  You can do it, Homie.


  Think of the candlepins.


  This is our extra ball!
  A better life.


  (YELLS)
  (ALL GASPING)
  (QUACKING)
  Derrr!
  Stupid cheaters!
  You cheat,
  you flip out when people say you cheat,
  and everybody knows
  you're nothing but a
 big bunch of cheaters!
  (CHUCKLING)
  You made us leave that lovely city
  rather than just put on a stupid hat.


  It wasn't even fitted.


  (SIGHS) I just couldn't wear the hat.


  Well, I'm still mad at you.


  I never even got to experience
 one of those Boston winters
  everyone raves about.


  Come on, baby, we could
 never escape our problems
  by moving somewhere else.


  Our problems are who we
 are, not where we are.


  Well maybe.


  The traffic was pretty annoying.


  Not to mention the unspoken racism.


  It wasn't that unspoken.


  At least someone in this family
  is happy about where they came from.


  Oh, don't worry, Lisa.


  You'll get back to Boston someday.


  What are you talking about?
  I never left.


  I'm in Boston now.

 giant drinking that thing.


  I was in line for that job,
 and I lost it to someone
  who barely speaks English.


 It's humidifying.


  HOMER'S VOICE: Well, then why the
 hell don't you do something about it?
  Huh? Who said that?!
  Me! (grunts)
  Who are you?
  I'm your ambition.


  How come I never met you before?
  I've been locked up for 30 years
 by Apathy and Alcoholism!
  (both groaning)
  Now, Homer, Tibor is no better than you.


  He just dresses nicer.


  I guess I could dress a little better.


 Probably.


  That's the most ambitious
 thing you've ever said.


  Guys, is there something
 wrong with the way I dress?
  No.

 If you're a typewriter
 salesman in 1953.


  Also, for a guy, you show
 way too much cleavage.


  Hey, these two have gotten me
 out of so many traffic tickets.


  Look, man, if people think
 your clothes are outdated,
  they'll think you're outdated.


  Lenny wears suspenders.


  Correction: I rock suspenders.


  Ah, Tibor.


  There's my go-getter.


  Thank you, Witch of the Mountains.


  (band plays upbeat
 music, audience cheers)
  Tonight we have with us
  a distinguished senior journalist
  for another installment of our
 pointless Internet sensation:
  Talking Heads Sing Talking Heads.


  Kent Brockman, everybody!
  (Talking Heads music playing)
  And you may ask yourself
  How do I work this?
  And you may ask yourself
  Where is that large automobile?
  And you may tell yourself
  Okay, that's it.


  (band plays upbeat
 music, audience cheers)
  Speaking of once-in-a-lifetime
 experiences, Kent,
  I understand you have
 a fascinating story
  about your time in Basra.


  Well, Jimmy, I was embedded
 with the 98th Airborne.


  My lullaby was the thwap-thwap-thwap
  of the blades of a Chinook.


  I was in the 98th Airborne.


  I don't remember him.


  I don't even remember what I said
  at the start of this sentence!
  Out there, everyone was equal.


  I was "Brock," the pilot was "Bama.

"
  Was he from Alabama?
  He was from America, Jimmy.


  To me, it was just another
 day at the office.


  Only this day, the office was
 a burning piece of metal
  where an RPG just took out the pilot.


  So I grabbed the joystick and
 guided that wounded bird
  down onto a container ship
 which was sinking.


  I bailed it with my helmet
 and guided her home.


  (audience cheering)
  That didn't happen, man!
  Oh, you Iraq War vets
 are always complaining.


  (mocking): "That didn't happen.

"
  "The temperature was 125.

"
  "The U.

S.

O.

 show was Rob Schneider.

"
  "American objectives have been,
 and remain, incomprehensible.

"
  Wah-wah-wah.


  MARGE: Dinnertime!
  (humming)
  No junk food!
  We're at the dinner tables.


  KENT BROCKMAN: This is
 Kent Brockman with a
  humble apology.


  (dramatic kettle drum plays)
  You know, we in the news business
  like to report the story; we
 don't like to be the story.


  That's what I said to Nelson
 Mandela atop the Berlin Wall,
  but No, I didn't.

 That's the problem!
  Now you're not eating.


  I can't eat when I'm
 watching the spectacle
  of an imploding celebrity.


  We have lip-quiver, people.


  I'm sorry to report to
 you that over the years,
  every interesting thing I've done is,
  in fact, a complete lie.


  I did not land a Chinook helicopter.


  I did not see bin Laden die, or
 even see the movie about it.


  Now that I've apologized,
 my station has assured me
  that it has full confidence
  These were the last words of
 disgraced anchor Kent Brockman
  before he was escorted out by security
  and replaced by me, Arnie Pye.


  This reporter promises
  to restore our news
 department's credibility.


  In our top story, corporate
 taxes are too high.


  Geez, I'm really gonna
 miss Anderson Cooper.


  That wasn't Anderson Cooper.


  Oh, thank God.


  I'm not licked yet
 not as long as I've got
  a cell phone and a place to sit.


  Company car.


  (tires screech)
  Marge, I think I may
 have to get new clothes.


  (whispers): At last!
  It's time for me to project the image
  of a powerful, self-reliant man.


  Will you take me shopping after school?
  Sure.

 And after that, maybe you could
  oh, I don't know, lose a little weight?
  Marge, no, don't get
 greedy, don't get greedy.


  Sweetheart, I'm always happy
 to temporarily lose weight.


  Oh
  So, this app is called Smothr.


  Lets my mom keep a
 healthy eye on me 24/7.


  Milhouse, you're overexcited.


  You're going to get a bloody nose.


  I will not!
  See?
  Hmm.

 I call these num-nums
  because they make my fingers numb.


  Mmm, mmm, mmm!
  Why are the only ingredients here
  "water, fun and hydrogenated chuckles"?
  Hey, Krusty makes quality products.


  Incoming!
  Mm, let me try one of those candies.


  I shared a meal with Lisa.


  It's halfway to a kiss.


  Now I kissed Lisa.


  No one kissed Lisa!
  - Hmm?
 - Hmm?
  Hmm, I don't think candy
 should give me a tingling
  in my left arm.


  I'm gonna prove to you that Krusty
  is a good clown with nonlethal candy.


  Hey, Otto-man, can you take us
 to the food processing district?
  No way, Bartman.


  Hey, Otto, I just remembered,
  we have a field trip to the
 food processing district.


  Oh, man, we're late!
  (tires screech)
  FRANK SINATRA:  This town 
  Is a lonely town 
  Not the only town 
  You're a very lucky lady.


  (laughs)
  (humming)
  Hmm? (groans)
  Hmm.


  (grunting)
  Really? You're thwarted by a shirt?
  Never!
  This is so exciting
  with my Homie in a haberdashers.


  My husband needs a complete makeover.


  Well, thank you, lady
 with the beehive hair.


  Ooh, intimate but heterosexual.


  CLERK: Here you are, pal.


  (moaning): Oh! Oh!
  Homie?
  Oh, baby, you had the same idea I did.


  Mmm!
  This wasn't my idea, but (gasps)
  Oh
  (chuckles) They all think
 they're the first ones.


  Wow.

 Ready for the corner office.


  I feel like Mrs.

 Mad Men.


  Now let's get you rung up, lard-ass.


  - What did you call me?
 - Uh, Lord S.


  Oh.


  Well, we've got a nice-
 looking couple here.


  Walk away, Marge, just walk away.


  I'm holding my sharpest key.


  Wait, Homie.

 It's Kent Brockman.


  The man who betrayed our trust.


  I'm producing my own news content now.


  Could you spare a few sound bites
  (chuckles): for this rudderless anchor?
  Forget it.

 We only like
 newspeople we can trust.


  So no newspeople!
  Oh, well, I have bigger problems.


  Can't afford toothpaste, so
 tonight my teeth will have
  film at 11:00.


  OTTO: Adios!
  Don't worry, Krusty's favorite number
  is how many jokes he's written.


    Wow! Hydroponic gardening.


  Organic fertilizer.


  Maybe I was wrong about Krusty.


  (groans) This candy is
 reeking with chemicals!
  Just once I'd like to be wrong.


  Well, from what I read in your
 diary, you're rarely right.


  (groans)
  We've got to get these samples analyzed.


  Bart, do you think we'll
 get out of here safely?
  I think the guard's no problem.


  (snores)
  (robotic voice): Z, Z, Z-Z-Z.


  (snores)
  Z, Z, Z-Z-Z.


  (snores) Z, Z, Z-Z-Z.


  Here comes our ride.


  (bicycle bell dings)
  I called UberKid.


  (Eastern European
 accent): Please get in.


  You want bottled water? Mints? Take.


  Your accent is so interesting.


  Where are you from?
  Uh, small town in Latvia.


 You don't know it.


  Well, I'd like to hear.


  Why do you have to make
 friends with everyone?
  (sighs) So much great work for naught.


  Kent, as your agent, I promise
 we will find you something,
  or so help me, we will drop you.


  That's a promise.


  Well, could you, uh, get me on Fox News?
  Would you be willing to
 call yourself a liberal
  and lose every discussion?
  Every single one?
  Okay, you've already asked
 too many questions.


  The offer's dead.


  (sighs)
  Empower your horse 
  Right through the sun 
  Blast a rainbow light from
 your empowerment gun.

 
  So, you're gonna get this to Katy Perry?
  I never said that.


  Hey, guys.

 Notice anything different?
  Whoa, whoa, impressive!
  Italian?
  Oh-ho.

 Better.


  Connecticut! (chuckles)
  Yeah, I think I'm gonna go
 into old man Burns and say,
  "Here is a leader of men and women.

"
  'Cause that's what you have to say now.


  High five, man!
  Why do we call it "high five"
 when we only have four fingers?
  You know, I've always wondered that.


  FRINK: Oh, what have we here?
  Uh, Lisa, these vials
  are filled with formaldehyde.


  Formaldehyde! Do you understand?
  Do not imbibe!
  Check.

 No imbibing.


  Bart! Imbibing is eating,
 and formaldehyde is poison.


  Oh, you take all the fun
 out of eating poison.


  You're just an apologist for Krusty.


  I am not a paid apologist for Krusty!
  I didn't say "paid.

"
  Got to go.

 I'll see you in the future.


  (mechanical humming)
  Uh, that's just my bathing suit dryer.


  I, uh yes.


  (groaning)
  Sorry, kid, not
 interested in your story.


  Krusty's our biggest star,
  and formaldehyde's our biggest sponsor.


  I'm gonna have to go off the grid.


  All right, Kent Brockman.


 Welcome to BizzFad.


  We are so crunched.


  (chuckles): Well, the
 crunching is mutual.


  "The crunching is mutual"?
 What the hell does that mean?
  Well, I know that the media has changed,
  but this old newshound can
 still find his way home.


  Okay
  I thought I might do a piece on
 all the crazy ice cream flavors
  they have these days.


  Bacon? Really?
  (chuckles)
  Kent, I like it.

 I do.


  But we just went bankrupt.


  Uh, people, people, you're all fired.


  But, seriously, it's
 been a great four days.


  Thank you.


  Uh, gentlemen, I suggest
 we ramp up production.


  I have a few suggestions
 right here in my pocket.


  Do it, Homer! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
  (gasps) Are you Lust?
  No.

 Lupus.


  (shrieks)
  Huh? Huh? Huh?
  (chuckles) Hey, fatso,
  I'd close that tent flap
 before the mosquitoes get in.


  (chuckles)
  What the?
  I thought you would like it.


  Actually, I think you
 should take this tarp
  back to the baseball
 stadium you got it from.


  In case there's a rain delay.


  (chuckles) I did not
 see that coming, sir.


  Off you go, Simpson.


  Never seek to better yourself again.


  I'm just going to shove my foot
 on your back for emphasis.


  Yes, sir.

 I understand.


  But could you try not to
 get my new jacket dirty?
  Sorry, but no.


  Well done, sir.


  Now your turn, Smithers.


  I never thought you'd ask.


  So, why do you want to give
 the story to Brockman?
  Because the best thing you
 can do is offer a lifeline
  to a person with no hope.


  Here I am!
  Sorry, not you.


  Thank God!
  Well, how do you know
 where Brockman will be?
  To find a fallen man,
  you must visit the scene
 of his highest peak.


  When he reported on the flood of '09.


  My career and these flood waters
 crested at the same time.


  This is Kent Brockman blowing a sad song
  on his beer bottle.


  (playing sad tune)
  Mr.

 Brockman, we've
 uncovered a huge story!
  And we need a real newsman
 to break it wide open.


  (sighs)
  A real newsman, eh?
  Then you've come to the wrong corner.


  What do you mean?
  Oh, I'm through.


  Now, please, let me just go out
  with my remaining dignity intact.


  This is Kent Brockman thinking
 dark and suicidal thoughts.


  It's quiet here in the gutter.


  Very quiet.


  Well, it was.


    Okay, who would like to start today?
  Anyone? Anyone?
  Oh, come on.


  In three, two
  I'm here live at the support group
  Our top feeling today
  This just in: I'm sad.


  (slurring): You know,
 I'll be tooling around,
  and I'll just constantly lapse
 into my elocution exercises.


  "A Lockheed L-1011 landed safely
  in Bogalusa, Louisiana, after an alert.

"
  Oh, I've been there.


  - Too true.


 - Courage.


  Kent, you're looking
 unusually thoughtful
  and silent for an anchor.


  You know, I thought I'd come to terms
  with life off the news
 cycle, and then, bang,
  I was offered a scoop on a platter.


  (slurring): Well, did
 you leap on that lead
  like a lion on a lemur?
  I passed! As in, "I
 am a thing of the"
  Dan Rather, do you have
 something to contribute
  besides this delicious
 homemade Bundt cake?
  Mmm.


  Kent, why are you doing this?
  Why did you get into this business?
  Money, women, free coffee.

 The usual.


  Sir, if you please, these days,
 a bona fide uncorrupted story
  is rarer than a snake with sneakers.


  It's harder to find than a
 yellow-fronted bowerbird.


  Jump on it, hoss,
  and ride till Gramma
 churns the buttermilk.


  That's when the barn dance starts.


  What is that feeling?
  Is it integrity?
    Good to see ya, buddy.

 I'm in!
  Anybody got eyeliner and pancake makeup?
  Take mine, brother.


  Works great on Mediterranean skin.


  It's from my personal
 line, Rather Handsome.


  Well, Marge, I was humiliated by Mr.


 Burns, it's true.


  But, to me, this is nothing
 more than a temporary setback.


  Good for you, Homie.

 I'm proud of you.


  Hey, Homer Simpson is not deterred
  by a footprint on his suit.


  It'll come out, right?
  - I don't know.


 - (shrieks)
  Homer, I have a 12-step
 plan for your success.


  Step number one: get in a 12-step plan.


  (grunts) This is an opportunity!
  (screams)
  I think I'm going to Moe's.


  (tires screech)
  Krusty, we have evidence
 that your product
  is laced with toxic additives.


  Yeah.

 So why you bothering me?
  LISA: Because your tasty
 little treat did this.


  (whirring)
  I made the doctor cry.


  They told me the paralysis
 would be temporary!
  Five years, tops.


  Seriously, come on,
  that kid wasn't going anywhere anyway.


  It looks like this clown could
 not formalde-hide the truth.


  (chuckles) This is Kent
 Brockman, saying
  No! I'm gonna sing Beatles songs
  so you can't afford to show this video!
  - A-one, two, three, four!
 - Too late!
  Well, you're back on top, Kent.


  And now for a once monthly feature we do
  called Serious Question.


  (horn honks)
  Tell us, how did you get this story?
  Well, it's funny, actually.


  I was trapped in a burning building
  (gasps) Is he really gonna
 take all the credit for this?
  Don't ask me.


  The last newsman I could trust
  was that bigamist, Charles Kuralt.


  It was a burning building
 called my career.


  Thank God I had help.


  Lisa Simpson, you deserve to
 be on this couch with me.


  But because I don't lie anymore,
  I have to say I didn't fight
 too hard when they said no.


  Hmm.

 Is that enough?
  Are you kidding?
  You got Hollywood's highest honor:
  shared credit, no money.


  I've been informed that
 this is my last newscast
  as anchor of the Channel 6 News.


  Before I go, I'd like to get
 a few things off my chest.


  I've made out with Kent's daughter.


  The grown-up one!
  Are you almost through?
  In a hurry to fail again, Kent?!
  No, it's just I've been off
 the air for six weeks,
  and it was torture.


  Sometimes I'd watch Bill O'Reilly
  and pretend it was an older,
 stupider version of me.


  Go ahead.

 Take your chair.


  Do what you do best.


  Tonight's lotto numbers: six, 17, 42,
  45 and 83!
  I'm back!
      


                





                    			1
  FOLKSY ANNOUNCER: Well, it's the
 first Saturday in September,
  and that means one thing in Springfield.


  It's that time again.


  Opening day of peewee football.


  (OVER P.

A.

): And everybody's headed
  down to Child Soldier Field
 to catch all the action.


  It all comes down to this,
  the first game of the year,
  perfect season on the line.


  And drunks are being
 rolled off the field.


  Ladies and gentlemen,
  your Springfield Neutrinos!
  (CROWD CHEERING)
  BART: Huh?
  NELSON: Where'd everybody go?
  BART: I can't see.


  (GASPS) They over-fogged the run-in!
  They put those kids in danger
  just to psych up the crowd.


  Yeah, are you psyched up now?
  Huh? Are you?!
  (PLAYERS PANICKING, HELMETS CLONKING)
  Concussions!
  Concessions!
  - (DOOR DINGS)
 - Aah!
  (ANXIOUS CHATTER)
  My boy hit his head doing football!
  I'm a doctor's wife.


  Save my boy first!
  My boy needs an MRI!
  (CLAMORING) Ow!
  - Ow!
 - Ow!
  - Ow! Ow!
 - Oh!
  (THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
  With head injury concerns
  on the mind, the town has shut down
  its peewee football program.


  Professor, what danger does this
  concussion threat truly pose?
  Uh, well, Kent,
  these children will need their brains
  unbruised for the
 demanding, high-tech jobs
  of the future:
  polishing and buffing our robot masters.


  Indeed.


  And here to defend youth football,
  we have Nelson's dad.


  Are you wearing makeup?
  Is it worth the risk
 to your son's health
  when only .

1 percent of
 youth football players
  make it to the pros?
  You saying my boy doesn't
 have what it takes
  to play pro ball? Huh?
  Boy, show him your moves.


  Juke it, juke it!
  (GRUNTING)
  Why are you dekeing it
 when I said juke it?
  Take a lap!
  Without football, Kent, (NELSON GROANS)
  how are kids gonna learn
 character like I did,
  you stupid fruit-munch?
  And what is your problem, smart-nuts?
  (GRUNTS)
  Which brings us to this question:
  if not football,
  what sport is safe for our children?
  But there are so many club sports
  that can eat up all our free time.


  What about baseball?
  (SCOFFS) Baseball
  Rife with steroids!
  Then test for steroids!
  Oh and then there'll be no home runs!
  (ALL ARGUING) Um, I think
 I-I may have a solution.


  Wait, wait, wait, wait.


  What about biathlon?
  That teaches kids to ski and kill.


  How about Frisbee-golf?
  If I could just have your attention
  Hey, what about Filipino tooth-fighting?
  It builds biting, jaw
 strength and mouth work.


  The champion for a long time was a dog.


  (GROANS) No one is listening to me.


  Well, maybe no one wants to hear
  your ridiculous idea.


  Let's go, we're late for prenatal yoga.


  Milhouse is ten.


  Why are we still doing that?
  Poor Kirk.


  No one listens to him.


  Even Luann treats him like garbage.


  (SIGHS) Love's funny like that.


  Help him out.


  Make people listen to his idea.


  Oh, why me?
  I only came to this concert
  because I was told it was a potluck.


  (GRUNTS)
  (GROANS)
  (ARGUING CONTINUES)
  Attention, smothering parents
  who only came to hear themselves talk!
  You're an idiot! (ARGUING QUIETS)
  This guy has as much right to bore us
  as any of you!
  Take it away, buddy.


  (ECHOING): Buddy, buddy, buddy
  "Buddy.

" Huh.


  Um, I've got an exciting sport
  that's great exercise
 a-and teaches teamwork.


  Lacrosse.


  - La-what?
 - What-cross?
  What-what?
  Lacrosse.


  It's the perfect combination of
  America's two least watched sports:
  soccer and hockey.


  (MURMURING EXCITEDLY)
  Any kid can learn to play lacrosse.


  Even this.


  (PARENTS GASPING)
  This isn't a drive-in movie.


  (PARENTS GASPING)
  Everybody,
  feel free to whip stuff
 at my son's face.


  (LAUGHTER AND INDISTINCT CHATTER)
  Yarr.


  Now hold on there.


  Lacrosse has the second
 highest concussion rate,
  right after football.


  (CHANTING): Safer than football!
  Safer than football!
  Hey, why don't we have this fruit-munch
  teach our kids this crazy sport?
  Me, coach your kids?
  Most of you won't even make eye contact
  when I'm weighing your yogurt.


  I'll do it.


  If Homer will coach with me.


  Huh?
  We've come too far together
  on this crazy ride.


  It wouldn't feel right
 to do it without you
  buddy.


  (ECHOING): Buddy, buddy, buddy
  Mm?
  Oh, fine,
  I'll coach with this guy.


  But I promise you this:
  I will never stop complaining about it.


  (CHEERING)
  (GRUMBLING): Stupid sport
 I never heard of
  make me wake up early on a Saturday
  probably have to slice oranges
  Don't even know the rules
  because I refuse to learn 'em
  my kids will probably suck at it
  And I'll have to kneel down
  on photo day, knees get all wet
  despite my bad attitude,
  I'm thrilled by the nonstop action
  kids running towards me
  with a look of joy I've
 never seen before
  Dad, we won!
  It's okay, kids.


  What matters is you tried your best.


  Have an orange slice.


  No, we won!
  Yes, we're all winners.


  Because losing teaches valuable lessons.


  Have an orange slice.


  We did it, buddy.


  You and I make a great team.


  We won for real!
  For the first time in our lives,
  we can say "Good game"
  and actually mean it.


  Good game!
  Uh, good game!
  Ha! That's loser talk!
  (CHEERING)
  (GROANING)
  Wow, pizza really does
  taste sweeter after you win.


  (HUMMING HAPPILY)
  Dude.


  My kids have never won at anything.


  All the girl does is read
  and the boy's got one of those
  paying attention diseases
  that isn't really a disease.


  Awesome job, guys!
  How do you know so much about lacrosse?
  Wait.

 You want to know about me?
  (DISINTERESTED MUMBLING)
  Well, it all goes back
 to my college days,
  where I was the star attackman
 on our lacrosse team.


  (CROWD CHEERING)
  (MARCHING BAND PLAYING)
  I'd even been drafted
 to play in the pros
  for the Milwaukee Zoom.


  After scoring the
 championship-winning goal,
  I was on top of the world, man.


  I was high-fiving everybody.


  For the first time in my life,
  no one, and I mean no one,
 was leaving me hanging.


  I was slap-happy,
  I couldn't stop myself, until
  I highed one five too far.


  (METALLIC CLANK) (WRIST SHATTERING)
  Our school mascot, Sir Gudge-a-lot.


  (RETCHING)
  My Zoom dream died that day.


  Mm
  (GRUNTS ANGRILY)
  Uh Ah
  (METALLIC CLICKING)
  My wrist healed, but my wrist in here
  never did.


  I've never high-fived my own son.


  The mascot wore a suit of armor?
  Just like a knight!
  Yeah, but now lacrosse
 has brought us together.


  Hey, a toast,
  to new friendship!
  Could I get a roll of
 toilet paper, please?
  I get nosebleeds when I drink.


  To new
  friendship.


  Mm.

 Mm-mm.

 Mm-mm.


  (HOMER SNORING)
  - Dad! Dad!
 - Dad! Dad!
  Dad, wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
  (MOANING GROGGILY)
  Oof!
  (MAGGIE COOS)
  It's 6:00 a.

m.

 on a Saturday.


  We have a weekend lacrosse tournament!
  (HORN HONKING OUTSIDE) There's Coach K!
  Come on, come on, come on!
  (BART AND LISA GRUNTING)
  (LISA CHUCKLES)
  (BOTH BREATHING RAPIDLY)
  LISA: Come on, Dad!
  (GRUNTS, GASPS)
  Check out the travel
 van, brah! (CHUCKLES)
  Two days, ten games,
  700 miles and one sweet mixtape.


  I hope you like Big Bad Voodoo Daddy,
  'cause this van's about to swing.


  So I think about my next drink 
  And it's you and me 
  And the bottle makes three tonight 
  Uh
  I'm pretty sure a mixtape
  isn't just the same song
  over and over again.


  No, no, dude, they're
 different live versions.


  You can tell because some are longer.


  (MUSIC STOPS) Hey, you want
 a hit off my vape pen?
  It tastes like passionfruit
  and people think you're a smoker.


  Why would I want that?
  (CHUCKLING): Don't worry,
  Marge isn't here.


  Oh, speaking of which,
  where is the craziest place
  you two have ever done it?
  - What?
 - Let's both say it at the same time.


  One two

 - Chipotle!
  There are kids back there!
  Oh, they can't hear us.

  That's mush-on-mush.


  Doesn't this dweeb know

  Those sandwiches had so many carbs!

  Worse than Jim Harbaugh?
  Well, not that bad.


  I know Kirk's a bit of a dizzy duck,
  but remember, you're
 doing this for the kids.


  Right, right.

 The kids.


  Everything for the kids.


  (GASPS) Oh, God, he's coming!
  Hide, Marge.


  Oh, good call, buddy.


  Disco nap.


  We got to power up for

  Tonight?
  Which gentlemen's club
 should we hit first,
  Skin City or the Tassel Castle?
  Gentlemen's
  you mean a strip club?
  Yeah, Wiggles has great dancers,
  but they're kind of stuck up,
  if you believe Lap-Aficionado.

  Which, uh (CHUCKLES) I do.


  Why would I want to go to a strip club?
  I'm married to a naked lady.


  Drive time to Sapphire
 Diamond is only 39 minutes.


  That's the fastest it's been all day.


  Hey, wa 38 minutes!
  Listen, Kirk, I'm a lot
 of kind of guys
  A booze guy,
  a don't-know-my-kids'- birthdays guy,
  a steal-the-blow-dryer-
 from-the-motel guy,
  but I am not a strip club guy.


  You do want to hang with
 me, don't you, buddy?
  (GROANS SOFTLY)
  I can't do it.


  I can't pretend to be this guy's friend
  for one more second.


  I scored three goals today!
  I'm a jock.

 A jock!
  I didn't spit on my hand for
 the post-game handshake.


  Hey, pal, I don't like Kirk either,
  but look how much fun the
 kids' heads are having.


  (SIGHS)
  Of course I want to
 hang with you, buddy.


  But, you know, I'm pretty tired
 from all those YouTube videos
  you showed me about whiskey making.


  It gets its color from the barrel.


  I know, the barrel.


  Let's just get some sleep.


  Well, all right.

  I'm going for a walk.

  Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you.


  Well, you know what they say,

  is his assistant coach.

 finally meet a man? 
  The strongest bond a

 thinks that I'm his bro 
  Whoa, whoa 
  His eyes are small and beady 
  Staring, oh, so needy 
  How I despise him he will never know 
  So much cool stuff
 we can do as a pair 
  Everything about him is annoying

  He smells like fish oil pills

  Coach K!

  Hmm, it's not like Kirk
  to miss such an important
 pre-game rally.


  Yeah, well, better get
 slicing on these oranges.


  Where is that coach?
  If we lose this game,
  I have to give the mayor of Capital City
  a crate of Springfield apricots.


  We grow no apricots!
  Kirk is missing.


  I haven't seen him since he left home
  happily singing about his
 friendship with you.


  (HUMMING NERVOUSLY)
  Dad, what do you know?
  What? Nothing!
  I don't oh, oh
  All right.


  The truth is, your
 husband and your father
  is a soul-sucking loser who found out
  I was only pretending to be his
 friend for the sake of the team.


  But, but why did he empty
 out our bank account,
  and all in one-dollar bills?
  Oh, no.


  There's only one thing
 a man like Kirk wants
  with that many singles.


  To hand out to the poor?
  Worse.


  To bring to a strip club.


  I'll go get him.


  I'll also get him.

 No, me! Me!
  I just need to go home and put on
  my special sweat pants.


  No, it's my husband's fault
 that Kirk has run off
  to that jiggle joint and
 only he can get him out.


  Me?
  But those places are filled with creeps.


  Plus, all the chairs face the stage.


  What if I want to have a conversation
  with another patron?
  Come on, Dad, you've got to do it!
  Without Coach K, we can't
 play in the championship!
  Look at the countdown clock.

  He can do this.

  Oh, worst food I've ever had.


  So much

  He hasn't slept in days.


  He brought a cooler of rice sandwiches.


  He says they give him energy.


  Wait, who do I know that
 likes rice sandwiches?

  So anyway, they can't call it bourbon
  unless it's from Kentucky.


  It's the American bourbon He's

  Kirk, we've got to go.


  The big game is about to start.


  Come on buddy?
  Oh, now I'm your buddy again, huh?
  Well, guess what, buddy.


  Carmeleena and Bodacious
 are my true friends.


  Nothing, nothing that we had was real.


  Well, it was all fake.


  But, damn it, somehow you turned
 our fat, lazy, loser kids
  into winners.


  Kirk Van Houten, I don't like you.


  But I respect you.


  Respect?
  That's the one thing you can't buy
  in a place like this.


  (LOUD PEELING)
  I've got to get to that game!
  Hey, that's a great realization
 you had there, pally.


  Now if we could just settle this up, eh?
  $15,000?
  12 lap-dances an hour, times
 three girls, times 56 hours,
  pole tax, glitter recycling fee.


  It's quite a ride.

  We'd do anything for 'em.

  It's just hard when you think
 you're gonna be slicing
  the same boy in half all your life.

  Why are you wearing a fishing hat?
  (GASPS) Are you going

  Unless it's boring.


  Is there someone else?

  Marge, I can't have a baby.


  Coordinating our sleep
 schedules will be a nightmare.


  Plus, the only good relationship
 I ever had was with my hat.


  Then the wind blew it away.


  You didn't have a good
 relationship with your father?
  Hmm.

  Maybe I can finally be a good dad!
  That's not Bart.


  Don't ruin my epiphany!

 - Hey, Mr.

 Van Houten.


  - Oh, hey, Bart.

 Milhouse isn't here.


 - I know.


  And I don't care.


  Are you making envelope soup?
  Envelope soup?
  (CHUCKLES) That'd be silly.


  No, I'm stamp mining.


  You steam off the stamp,
 color in the postmark,
  and you just made half a dollar.

 Almost.


  Want to try?
  Careful! That's a forever stamp!
  Could be worth a fortune some day.


  Well done.


  And look at me.


  I'm hangin' out with Bart Simpson.


  That's so cool.


  I can't wait till Wendell
 sees us hangin' out.


  Oh, hey.


  Oh, I built it up too much.

  Homer, why were you
 fishing with Milhouse?
  Because for once, I'm with
 a kid who respects me.


  One who doesn't call me "Homer.

"
  I didn't know that bothered you.


  It does.

 A lot.


  Oh, Homer.


  Feels good when you say it.


  Homer.


  Ah
  Honey, maybe you should talk to Bart.


  He's just behind that wall.


  BART: Yeah, Homer!
  Get your fat ass over here!
  You see? You see?!
  It's not bad enough he calls me "Homer.

"
  He calls my buttocks "ass.

"
  Hmm.

 He probably learned that at school.


  You bet your ass he did.


  Maybe you and Lisa can talk to him.


  Lisa and I aren't speaking right now.


  I can't believe you threw
 away my Utne Readers!
  MARGE: Oh, is that how
 you pronounce it? Aah!
  (BIRDS SINGING)
  For most of my child's

  Aah.


  Oh, Abe, hi.


  I-I was about to call you.


  I had an ultrasound today.

 But
    Does this mean?
  Yup, I'm the father.


  And I thought she was just
 using me for a beard.


  (GASPS)
    I'm so sorry, Abe.


  (SIGHS): Well, I just want to say
  Yes! I can't raise my left arm,
  much less a child!
  Yippee! Not having kids keeps you young!
  Oh, I knew you'd come back!

 - Homer.


  - Dad.


 - Fat Ass.


  That is not my name!
  Mm, mm, mm!
  Let's roll.


  Can't let 'em catch us.


    I can't take the pressure!
  (GASPS) (TIRES SCREECH)
  Son, I'm so sorry!
  I'm getting rid of this stupid stop sign
  before it hurts somebody else!
  (GRUNTS)
  (TIRES SCREECHING, HORNS HONKING)
  I'm sorry, too, Dad.


  (GASPS) You called me Dad!
  There's a first time for everything.


  Also, a last.


  Milhouse, I'd be lying if I
 said riding in a go-cart
  with Bart Simpson wasn't
 the highlight of my life,
  but you're my son and I love you.


  I love you, too, Dad.


  You're my favorite guy
 that Mom's brought home.


  Aw
  Last one home is a rotten father!
  Those aren't yours to keep!
  They take them out of our pay!
  HOMER: We'll bring them back
 when we get tired of them!
  Oh, that never happens.


  But, Chief, I I don't
 think those vehicles
  are certified for highway use.


  Yeah, well, I don't
 think you're certified
  to understand the relationship
 between a father and son, Lou.


  Yeah, well, I have a son
 He lives in Baltimore.


  What do you want, a parade, Lou?
  Listen, Maggie Can
 I call you Maggie?
  Is there a way I can get you
 to put that pacifier down?
  (CHUCKLES): Oh, don't worry.


  I'll be here as long as it takes.


  You know, if you cooperate,
  I can talk to your mother
 about a reduced time out.


  Look, you wanted a helicopter,
  I got you a helicopter.


  Okay, I've got your nose, and if
 you want to see your nose again,
  you'll give me that pacifier!

  you've thought of everything.


  Except for one nagging detail.


  Did I ever tell you about the

  It was the Shelbyville Players

  What did you write?

  MARGE: Thanks, partner.


  We've balled up all the 13 gauge alpaca.


  Now maybe there's
 something fun we can do?
  Sure is.

 A puzzle.


  "Foggy Day in Berlin.

"
  5,000 pieces.


  Hmm
  (German accent): Homer,
 complete the puzzle!
  I'm a married man!
  Fine.

 If you need me,
  I'll be in your schpankenbank.


  FEMALE SINGER:  We'll meet again 
  Marge, I don't think we
 should do this puzzle.


  I know.

 You can't pick up the pieces.


  That's why I've devised a grid system.


  Huh? I'll hold up a piece,
 and you call out the number
  and letter of the
 corresponding grid square.


  Uh I don't know.


  Q 15?
  Sweetie, it's a side piece.


  Q 15's in the middle.


  Right.

 Q 15 is in the middle.


  Nothing more fun than rules.


  I'll make some tea to help you think.


  Oh, I hate being immobile and numb.


  If only I was free to move.


  (moans)
  If only.


  (excited chatter)
  It's never pleasant to see
 this kind of activity, Lisa.


  Particularly on a cell phone
 that is so much nicer
  than the one I own.


  All the fighting seems to start
 with who sits where on the bus.


  Um, Lisa.

 You seem to have a
 handle on the bus problem.


  Why don't you tackle it? But
 don't think I won't help.


  I'm providing you with a sash.


  Skinner!
  You are asking a six-year-old girl
  to fix this school's problems.


  I'm eight.


  Oh, carry on.


  What do you mean, there's a legal issue
  with my trapdoor?
  And, uh, as you explain,
  please take two steps back.


  The old trapdoor was perfectly legal.


  It was grandfathered in
 under the Reagan-era code.


  But once you start renovating it,
  it has to brought up
 to modern standards.


  Mm.

 And it has to be
 handicap accessible.


  A wheelchair would never fall
 through the current opening.


  (chuckling): Oh! But
 that's not a problem!
  I refuse to hire the handicapped.


  That's another issue.


  But for now, we have left ourselves open
  to a lawsuit by Homer Simpson.


  Fine.

 Smithers, go see
 this Simpson character
  and trick him into signing
 a waiver of liability.


  I'll discuss things with the foreman.


  (yelling): Enrique,
 mas grande la puerta!
  (Homer moans)
  Look, Homie! We got
 three pieces together.


  That's a good day's work!
  Why don't we do one of Maggie's puzzles?
  Cow goes in the cow-shaped hole, boom.


 Next case.


  Hmm, I thought the one good thing
 about you hurting yourself
  was that we could spend
 more time together.


  You did?
  Didn't you?
  Oh yeah, sure, of course.


  Only a fool would admit otherwise.


  Mm.


  (doorbell rings)
  (sighs)
  (sighs)
  Mr.

 Smithers! Come in, come in.


  (chuckling): Oh! Well,
 there's our tangle-foot!
  Already on the mend.


  Yeah, right.


  They say it'll be three months
  before I can scratch my ass.


  Six before I can really go at it.


  Listen, I-I don't want
 to take up your time.


  I just need Homer's signature
 on a couple of things.


  First, a get well card to himself.


  And what else does he need to sign?
  Oh, a (coughing)
  waiver of liability.


  I know, I know.


  There are solid reasons to sue.


  But do you really want to fill your life
  with parasitic attorneys
 with get-rich-quick schemes?
  Schemes? Rich? Quick?
  Parasitic? Woo hoo!
  How could I have forgotten to sue Mr.


 Burns?
  That's how you get rich in America.


  Sue S.

 A! Sue S.

 A!
  Oh, Lord.


  Finally, a chance to use this.


  It was designed ironically,
 but I would die for it.


  Are you home during the day
 because you were injured
  at work, school, museum, church,
 Iraq, elevator plummet,
  uneven sidewalk, hit by foul
 ball, hit by fair ball,
  or Iditarod viewing party?

  Call me, Maxwell Flinch,
  at 555-555-5555.


  Five, five, five
  Wait, what was the number
 after the first three fives,
  but before the last six fives?
  Uh, Simpson, before
 you do anything rash,
  Mr.

 Burns wanted you to
 enjoy this get-well cake.


  - What's that writing on top?
 - Oh!
  It's just, uh, strawberry boilerplate
  absolving us of liability.


  Now just bite here, here, here,
  nibble here, lick here
  Uh, your wife needs to
 eat this cupcake
  Sir, you cannot bribe me with cake.


  Because I just ate several pies.


  Hello, Mr.

 Smithers.


  I see you haven't given up.


  (sighing)
  Just enjoy the cake.

 As
 long as you don't eat it
  in front of a notary
 public, you're fine.


  I'm a notary public.


  You gave your ink pad to Maggie.


  - (moans)
 - I'll, um, I'll walk out with you.


  Don't go yet.

 You guys can help me
  brainstorm a pattern for my new quilt.


  Marge, I mean this in the nicest way:
  your idea of fun makes me
 want to blow my brains out.


  (murmurs disappointedly)
  Oh, Razzmatazz is perfect, Marge.


  It's-it's uh-- it's red,
  but not, uh, too red.


  You're right!
  Why don't you stick around
  and we'll discuss stitching
 patterns over tea?
  I'd like that.


  And I'll take the cake back to the home
  and share it with the seniors.


  Typical.


  I'll keep Dad company.


  Thank you, Bart.


  GRAMPA (moaning): Oh, I dropped it.


  Hey, wha-what did you put down my back?
  Could be a tarantula,
  could just be some yarn.


  I'll be at Milhouse's.


  (whining fearfully)
  (sighing)
  What the hell?
  Oh, it's such a pleasure
 to pour tea for someone
  and not have to help him chew it.


  We've made our choices.


  And the world doesn't understand them,
  but we do.


  Oh! Ew
  Oh Aw
  You know Marge, somehow I feel that
  more than anyone, you understand
  those horrible words,
 "What do you see in him?"
  I never said this,
  but did you ever think
 we cling to these guys
  because we're afraid to
 admit we were wrong?
  Do you really think that?
  Well, I've tried to use
 it constructively.


  I try to have "the serenity
  "to accept the things I cannot change
  and the courage to change
 the things I can.

  No one ever gives me a gift.

 Thank you.


  No one ever tells me thank you.


  I think you see my true self.

  Oh, my God.

 I want to kiss him.

 She wants to kiss me.

  Come here, you.


  Okay, but (exclaims)

  Marge is getting her emotional
 needs fulfilled by another man,
  and now she needs me
 for nothing but sex.


  I'm the luckiest husband in the world!
  You haven't gotten that
 stupid signature yet?
  No.


  And I'm not sure I want to.


  You defy me?
  Smithers, pour me a glass of water.


  Now squeeze my chest.

  Now, either get that signature
 or you're in charge
  of restarting our plant at Chernobyl.


  That was us?
  That doesn't leave this room.


  Well brother, prepare

  Lisa, the bus is supposed to be crazy.


  It's the brief respite
 between the twin nightmares
  of home and school.


  The one thing a know-it-all doesn't know
  is that everyone hates a know-it-all.


  Did we, uh, lose anyone?
  Just the police chief's son.


  (beeping)

  (clears throat)
  Marge, this is the last
 time I'm coming by.


  Oh.

 Well, that's fine.


  I mean, I do have my knitting to get to.


  Mm-hmm! 
  I'm going to a living hell
  followed by a certain death.


  Here's a picture to remember me by.


  Taken by my grandma from her deathbed.


  (sniffles) The last thing she saw.


  Mmm.

 Mmm.

 Mmm.


  Mmm.


  What's wrong, honey?
  Oh, I don't feel like I
 have anyone to talk to.


  I appreciate that, and I'd like to talk.


  I'm just so drained after all
 the time I spend with the kids.


  BART: What time?
  I took you to that colonial village.


  That was a pub at the airport.


  I had an ale.

 You sat on a barrel.


 That makes it colonial.


  Homer, I'm sorry, you
 have to understand.


  Without Waylon to talk to,
 I feel completely alone.


  I totally get it.


  One question: who's Waylon?
  Smithers.


  Totally get it.


  Oh, my wife really needs
 something and to get it
  I may have to forego my settlement.


  Homer, you fell down a
 trapdoor into a cement mixer.


  Don't you think I deserve
 something for that?
  I'm just trying to do what's right.


  Then why did you file a lawsuit?
  I really think you should
  change the venue, sir.


  You can't win a case in this town.


  Oh, are they still mad about
 me eating the town panda?
  Get over it.


  Wait, wait, wait, wait.


  I'm willing to sign anything
 you want on one condition.


  Fine.

 What's your condition?
  You have to keep Mr.

 Smithers here.


  I see.

 And are you fool enough
  to believe a man's
 handshake means anything?
  I am.


  Well, put 'er there.


  Homer, no!
  Why doesn't anyone ever
 think of the lawyer?
  Aw, if I do a slip 'n' fall
 on the courthouse steps,
  would that help?
  (sniffs) It might.


  See you Thursday.


  And I'll see you Thursday night.


  Oh.

 (chuckles)
  And I'll see you early Friday morning.


  Mm-hmm.


  Mm-hmm.


  Oh, these slippery stairs.


  (exclaiming)
  (gasps) Homie!
  Marge, no!
  (honks)
  Marge,
  I know Smithers was
 good at talking to you.


  And I want to talk to you too.


  Oh.


  Just don't expect me
 to be great at first.


  Oh, honey, no one's
 great their first time.


  It's like baking.


  Uh, okay, well, uh
  I like you.


  And I adore you.


  You sacrificed yourself
 for my happiness.


  There is nothing that makes a woman
  feel more cherished and secure.


  Thank you, my darling.


  (whispers): Marge, this is going great.


  GRAMPA: Now don't you worry,

  Usually, the Fourth Sunday

  I hope the reverend

  Comparing the Three Wise

  seemed more desperate than hip.


 I'm serious.


  (GROANS)
  Even Milhouse could've made that.


  What is it, Helen?
  Uh, well, Tim, just
 thought you should know,
  a very special fan club is
 waiting to talk to you.


  Mm!
  A semi-circle? What gives?
  LOVEJOY: Ned? Agnes?
  Mel? The Parson?
  That's right, your boss.


  And I'd like to introduce
 you to my boss,
  the Patriarch.


  Actually, Parson, we all
 have the same boss.


  The Metropolitan.


  And it is his will that we
 come together here for
  a divine intervention.


  Look, since when is it a crime
  to mix Pinot Noir and Vicodin?
  Oh, we don't care if
 you wreck your liver
  with Sancerre and acetaminophen.


  You can pop pain pills like cran-raisins
  for all we care.


  We're here 'cause you're not
 packing the p-p-p-pews.


  The church is emptier
 than a syrup bottle

  Oh, people have reasons to miss mass.


  There's flu going around, the new Jeeps
  are in at the dealership.


  Lot of new features, the big

  It's not just attendance, Reverend.


  It's that sometimes when you
 speak, my mind wanders,
  to, uh, non-religious areas.


  (METALLIC CREAKING)
  Timothy, admit it.

 You're in a slump.


  How many souls have you
 personally converted

  Negative six.


  You have some converting to do.

  I haven't been heard from!
  And what do you have to say?
  Nothing!

  Okay, I can do this.

  Come on guys, let's go check out
  this year's feature attraction:
  the Strandbeest.


  Powered by the wind!
  Wow.

 Uh
  Is this science,

 environmentally conscious.


  No.

 It is not.

  Whoa.

 It's alive!

  Hmm.

  This is a disaster!

  Well, don't feel bad.


  It's actually a pretty complicated rig.

  The thing is, I want to
 celebrate this time with you.


  Sweetie, I know you're reaching out.


  But to me, Christmas
 is just another day.


  I usually curl up with a
 good bookmaker, and
  Well
  Why don't the two of you
 spend Christmas with us?
  Our home isn't fancy, but
 we'd love to set a place
  for two more.


  Marge, we accept.


  Can we bring anything?
  Just yourself.


  That'll cost you.


  (SINGSONGY): Oh, Maggie.


  Guess who just came down the chimney?
  A magical holiday friend,
  straight from the North Pole.


  He's called the Gnome In Your
 Home, and he works for Santa,
  by watching you all the time.


  According to a book sold separately,
  the Gnome In Your Home
 doesn't need food or sleep.


  He lives for just one thing:
  to tell Santa if you're bad or good.


  (SUCKING PACIFIER RAPIDLY)
  He's gonna live here on your shelf,

  You really want me to go?
  Yes.


  Right now.

  Okay, I read this whole
 book while your father
  was hospitalized for food poisoning,
  and it changed my life.


  I want this house to
 reach what the monks call
  the "state of
 en-tidy-ment.

"
  En-tidy-ment? I thought
 this family meeting
  was about reducing the carbon footprint
  - of my college fund.


 - Done and done.


  Wait, wait.

 Why is it so easy?
  - Moving on.


 - Oh, man!
  I thought your mother was
 gonna tell us that Grampa died.


  Well, the meeting ain't over yet.


  The monks' philosophy is simple.


  Take every item you own and
 ask: does it still bring me joy?
  If yes, then you keep it.


  If not, you thank it for its service
  - and throw it away.


 - HOMER: Boring!
  Does this beverage coaster give me joy?
  Not anymore.

 (grunts)
  Not my "Oh, crap, I'm 50" coaster!
  You're not 50, and I
 don't like the word "crap.

  And I worry you drink too much beer.


  But the rest of it's good, right?
  That's all there is to it.


  Marge, before you go
 cuckoo with cleanliness
  and throw everything
 out, think of the kids.


  The kids working in overseas
 factories to make this crap.


  It's time for it to go.


  Coaster, thank you for your service.


  - Nyeh!
 - No one ever thanked me
  when I was in the service.


  All I got was a pack of
 cigarettes and a college education!

  There is one thing of yours that's
 not giving us much joy anymore.


  (quietly): You know what's not
 giving me joy is that Japanese book.


  - What'd you say?
 - Nothing.


  What I'm talking about is Plopper.

  Spider-Pig,
 Spider-Pig 
  Does whatever 
  A Spider-Pig does 
  We've had him since you found him,

  Look, I'm the only one who feeds him,
 cleans him, and maintains his wallow.


  I am grateful beyond words.


  I bet you didn't even know
 it was called a wallow.


  - I certainly did!
 - Then tell me what it's called.


  What what was called?
  The word I just said.


  Marge, I don't know what the word is.


  Let's not wallow in this all day.


  (groans) Please, just promise
 you'll find him a new place to live.

  If you don't find a home for that pig,

 - No, whatever you're going to withhold
  anything but that!
  I'll find him a home!
  Boy, I really don't want
 to get rid of the pig.


  Can you talk to your mother?
  - We have a pig?
 - Oh, it's hopeless.


  You know, I love this animal,
  so I'm gonna be very
 selective with his new owner.


  Okay.

  Non-smoker only.


  By which I mean he can't
 end up in your smoker.

  Are you here for my pig?
  I might be.

  I'd like a letter for a therapy animal
  of the pig persuasion.


  Oh, you fakers disgust me!
  Get out! You're harshing my clinic.


  How many opioids would you like?
  I don't want any!
  Oh, come on, you've got to be
 dependent on something.


  I just want a prescription
 for a therapy pig.


  Fine.

 Plus five opioids.


  Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco.


  And one for the doctor.


  Ah, ha.


  Gee, I didn't realize
 you had gone this far.


  A great musician only needs her instrument.


  And underwear 'cause
 this dress is mighty short.


  Time for a riff of joy.


  (playing mournful melody)
  Uh? Holding this, I feel only
 hours of tedious practice.


  Where is the joy?
  (playing mournful melody)
  That was beautiful, honey!
  No, it wasn't.


  I finally feel about my sax
  the way you all do.


  (long, deep gasp)
  (long, squealing gasp)
  Okay, Plopper, I'm going
 to the little pigs' room.


  Can you cover for me?
  Good, good.

 Not that many mistakes at all.


  (alarm blaring)
  (alarm stops)
  Okay, is that Homer or a
 pig that looks just like him?
  (snorting, squealing)
  Sounds like Homer, but
 smells like truffles.


  Toss in a bag of chips.


  (snorting, squealing)
  Yep, that's Homer.


  - Who's Homer?
 - The pig behind the desk.


  To a less secure man, being mistaken
 for a pig would be a wakeup call.


  This is great.

 All I had
 to do was say I'm crazy
  on my permanent record, and
 I get to bring a pig to work.


  - Yeah, they are pretty lax here.


 - That's right.


  I got turned down by McDonald's, but, here,
  they paid me the whole year I was in jail.


  You said you were getting rid of him.


  Marge, I'll take him to work and to Moe's.


  He'll be like me you'll barely see him.


  (sighs) Fine.


  (clinking)
  This is so hard for me to say,
  but my saxophone no longer gives me joy.


  I am giving it away.


  Aw, that is really, really sad.


  Wow, you understand how I feel.


  Yes, because I feel about my pig
  the way you used to feel
 about your honk-a-ma-flute.


  Okay, back to what really matters.


  So, I get the ball and I pivot to first
  (grunts) Ooh! Oh Oh, my God! (stammers)
  - I'm so sorry, Dad!
 - Accidents happen.


  Wow, Homie.

 Spilled gravy
  is one of your top three
 strangulation triggers.


  I could never strangle a boy
  in front of the pig.


  Huh.

 I think he really has
 become a support animal for you.


  He's totally changed the
 way I look at animals.


  Pass the pork chops.


  (chuckles) Everybody's looking at us.


  It's like bringing Elizabeth
 Taylor to the Oscars.


  (sighs)
  Can I pet your pig?
  Of course! You can all pet him!
  - Kiss both ends.


 - Homie, those kids' hands
  are covered in barbeque sauce.


  I know someone who's gonna
 get a sink bath tonight.


  (children laughing)
  (barking)
  (growls)
  (barking)
  No! Get away from him!
  - I'll spray you!
 - Dad, no!
  That's a snake from the petting zoo!
  - (hissing)
 - (gasps)
  - (screaming)
 - (gasps)
  (barking)
  (growling)
  (panting) Oh, my God!
  Oh, my God! (panting)
  I can't breathe.

 Chest pounding.


  - What's happening to me?!
 - You're having an anxiety attack.


  There really is such a thing?!
  Oh, the dogs contused his baby back ribs.


  Of course, there is the luau option.


  I will not subject him to something
 that has three vowels in a row.


  Uh, sir, I'm kind of
 worried about a lawsuit.


  Our Lloyd's of London
 policy excludes the hounds.


  Ooh! Damn that Lloyd.

 He's borne a grudge
  ever since I took his girl
 to see Lunardi's balloon.


  What are you talking about?
  I'm not sure myself.


  But don't worry, I'll have
 your swine taken care of
  right here in the finest
 sanatorium money can buy.


  - 
 - HOMER: What the
  Maybe he should go to an animal hospital.


  Oh, we'll take good care of Spider-Pig.


  (gasps) You know his secret identity?
  Mm-hmm.

 And your son is El Barto.


  These things are very easy to figure out.


  We'll take good care of him!
  I'm worried, Marge.


  His tail is all curly.


  It's always been curly.


  No, you're thinking of
 Bart when he was a baby.


  But this is no time to argue.


  He'll be fine.

 This place seems
 even nicer than the Mayo Clinic.


  Mayo Clinic, eh?
  Should we slice him diagonally
 or just cut off the crust?
  - Who cares? It's hopeless.


 - You fools.


  I'll save him like I've
 saved a million lunches!
  (pop)
  (screaming)
  (exhales) It gets harder every time.


  Mmm.


  You were imagining a clinic
 full of mayonnaise doctors,
  - weren't you?
 - Some were just interns.


  Whoa!
  What happened to your stuff?
  Gave it all away.

 Nothing brings me joy.


  Lis, for what it's worth, there was a time
  - I thought my life was horrible, too.


 - Really?
  Basically, it was when you were born.


  (scoffs) Thanks.

 I'm all cheered up.


  But I got over it.


  And your older, smarter
 brother is going to help you.


  Let's put our heads together.


  (clicking like gears)
  Wow.

 This actually is making me smarter.


  And next week, we will have the MRT,
  Mandatory Required Test.


  Students must bring two
 pencils and a quiet lunch.


  BART: This is WJZZ,
 Springfield Elementary's
  pirate jazz station.


  Good Lord, how is he
 overpowering my P.

A.

 system?
  We are preempting these
 lame-o school announcements
  with an original composition
 from Lisa Simpson.


  Warning, this may cancel math.


  (cheering)
  (jazz playing)
  It sounds like how paste tastes.


    You did it, Bart!
  You brought back my joy.


  - (grunts)
 - (grunts) Hey!
  I wouldn't have done it if I
 knew there was a hug at the end.


  - (grunting)
 - Hold that thought.


  School is canceled for the rest of the day.


  I do have a lot of errands to run.


  There.

 Good as new.


  I also took the liberty of putting
  a pop-up thermometer in him, just in case.


  Excellent.

 Now, Doctor,
 the matter of your bill
  It's on me.

 I always enjoy the chance
  to get my hands inside a pig.


  Good day.


  (dreamy waltz playing)
  Oh, my God.


  This reminds me of a golden moment
  with my beloved, ruthless papa.


    Yale wins! And only three killed!
  From this day hence,
 this beautiful creature
  will be my faithful companion.


  I-I thought I was your faithful companion.


  A man can have two faithful companions.


  But one is always his favorite.


  ("Gertrude's Dream Waltz"

  You've stolen my therapy animal.


  Now I have to control my own emotions.


  Well, he's still too ill to travel.


  (classical music playing)
  Now what's wrong?
  My joy's returned, but my sax is gone.


  (sniffles) I just want my passion back.


  Come with me.

 Is it related?
  Yes.


  (dog howls)
  The Japanese may have tidiness,
  but, in America, we have storage lockers,
  our only growth industry.


  Look.


  Oh, my God! You kept all our stuff!
  Well, I couldn't throw anything out.


  I wanted to be tidy,
 but I could only shift.


  (chuckles) Hello, old friend!
  (playing jazzy tune)
  Hey! Could you keep it down?
  Some of us are trying to
 throw a wedding in here!
  Go ahead, Reverend.


 Start at "Dearly beloved.

"
    (lock clicking)
  (light tapping)
  (quietly): Plopper,
 meet me at the side door,
  the one on the east wing by the greenhouse.


  Take the elevator to Floor 2-R.


  Not 2.

 2-R.


  That'll put you in the map room.


  Take the second set of stairs.


  Repeat, second set of stairs
  Well, finally.


  (barking)
  Ah!
  Heel!
  I, uh, know what it's like
 to have true love thwarted.


  (groans) Just take your pig and go
  before the old man realizes what's what.


  - What's what?
 - Go!
  -  And I 
 - 
  -  Will always love you 
 - 
  -  I will always 
 - 
  Love you 
  I will always 
  Love you 
  I will always 
  Love you 
  Marge, he brings me joy.


  And to keep him, I'll give up beer.


  - Deal.


 - Uh-oh.

 (women vocalizing)
  HOMER: In my younger and
 more vulnerable years,
  my father gave me some advice.


  He said, "The laziest
 way to tell a story
  is through voice-over narration.

"
  With that in mind, I tell the
 tale of the tragic collision
  between the last tycoon of the Jazz Age
  and the king of a hip-hop empire.


  It began with an old man
  feeling like his best
 years had passed him by.


  (sighs)
  You seem glum, sir.


  How about a blood transfusion?
  We have some new small batch,
  single donor plasmas.


  Mmm.

 Better make it a double.


  My life used to be so lively,
 so full of excitement.


  WOMEN:  Monty! 
  Such shindigs I threw
 at my summer estate.


  In an age of shameful excess,
  my parties were legendary for
 their magnificent excess.


  Fortunes were won and lost at my tables.


  Affairs were launched on my dance floor
  and consummated on my floor-floor.


  Sultans mingled with Sultans of Swat.


  MAN:  Monty! 
  (cheering)
  And presiding over it all was me,
  Monogram Monty Burns.


  (groans)
  Well
  what if we throw a classic shindig
  at your old summer place?
  Why, yes.


  A beachside bacchanal
  just like the Roaring Twenties.


  That'll put the Cole back in my Porter.


  What fun.


  Now, I have 45 close friends
  who are all pretty
 amazing party planners.


  I'm not squandering money
  on some chap to bring in a photo booth.


  I'll take care of every detail myself.


  Everything, sir?
  Oh, fine.

 You can fetch the ice.


  Okay.

 How many bags?
  Oh, no.

 None of those
 pricey store-bought cubes.


  Now, you head up to Northern Canada
  and get me a quarter ton of lake ice.


  Hand-sawn and tong-carried.


  Risk my life in the arctic wilderness
  just to bring you some ice.


  It would be an honor.


  Would you like it packed in
 cedar sawdust or Spanish oak?
  Oh, who cares? Ice is ice.


  It says Mega Stuf on the package,
  but these are Double Stuf at best.


  (licking) What?
  Send me a free tub of Stuf and
 I'll shut down my Web site.


  Mmm.


  Simpson, you seem fairly popular,
  at least based on the cheers you
 got at employee karaoke night.


  It's not me, it's "Mustang Sally.

"
  Mr.

 Burns is throwing a little party,
  and most of his invitees are
 either dead or fictional.


  Uh, to, uh, well, fill out the crowd,
  uh, perhaps you could, uh,
 distribute these invitations
  to your more, uh, presentable friends.


  I know just who to invite.


  - You're not invited.


 - To what?
  None of your business!
  All right.


  MARGE: "Your esteemed
 presence is requested
  "for an evening of madcap
 magic and mischief
  at Monty Burns' Middle Hampton estate.

"
  The card stock is so thick.


  Bart, get in here and feel this stock.


  Oh, man, that's heavy.


  The Springfield Hamptons?
  That's on Lengthy Island,
  where rich people hang
 out on summer weekends.


  I know all about it from
 cartoons in literary magazines.


  HOMER: I'm not reading all that.


  Well, now to select the
 perfect guest list
  of our city's sharpest wits
 and glittering socialites.


  (car alarms blaring, Homer whistling)
  Boy oh boy, a '20s shindig
 at Old Man Burnsie's.


  Probably gonna be
 bathtubs full of shrimp
  and Jacuzzis full of brisket.


  Maybe I'll meet a rich bachelor
 who will sweep me off my feet.


  - How do I smell?
 - (sniffs)
  Like a wood fire put out
 by dumping coffee on it.


  Oh! Perfect.


  Hey, everyone, hey!
  I'm off-duty, so please
  don't feel weird doing
 drugs in front of me.


  Uh, or with me.

 (chuckles)
  I became a cop too young.


  I never lived.


  I didn't live.


  HOMER: And so I entered
 a world of wealth.


  Where mansions are called "cottages.

"
  And getting drunk on a boat
  is called "sailing.

"
  (all gasping)
  HOMER: Get ready for fancy.


  (indistinct chatter)
  I don't see any magic.


  And not a hint of mischief.


  Off-brand Ritz cracker?
  Salt pile?
  Nothing in a blanket?
  Dad, did Mr.

 Burns cheap out?
  That's impossible.


  He's the richest man in town.


  If I had known this was a cash bar,
  I would've gotten wasted beforehand!
  At my sister's house!
  (fanfare plays)
  Welcome, honored guests.


  Leave your inhibitions at the door.


  And write your name on your drink cup,
  you will not receive a second.


  (muttering)
  Now, dance the night away on my
 vintage 1920s parquet floor.


  The cleaning of which is not cheap,
  so be sure to don your
 protective booties.


  (Moe grunting)
  SKINNER: Look, Mr.

 Burns,
  nobody loves a party with
 rules more than I do.


  Even I'm baffled by the
 toilet payment system.


  Oh, it's simple, bring the chit
 from the applicable restroom
  to the purser
  You might've been fun a
 hundred years ago, Burnsie,
  but now you're a cheap, old lamewad.


  And trust me, I know cheap.


  That's right, I bought a suit,
  Xeroxed it, returned
 it, and wore the copy.


  (grunts)
  (guests groaning)
  - Waste of my time.


 - Why is everyone leaving?
  Of course, no ice.


  Mm, that lazy Smithers is probably
  sipping hot buttered rum in a ski chalet
  overlooking Lake Louise.


  (grunting frantically)
  (growls)
  Ah.


  Uh-oh.


  Aw.


  (growls)
  - (brays)
 - (Smithers screams)
  (crying)
  Hey, Mr.

 Burns, fun party.


  No one felt any pressure
 to talk or laugh
  or stay past 7:30.


  Super chill.


  Oh, hush.

 I'm a worn-out old miser
  who's forgotten the meaning of fun.


  (gasps)
  Great Gatsby!
  What is that?
  (music and indistinct
 chatter in distance)
  Someone else is having a
 party across the bay.


  (chuckles) Once I
 would've thought nothing
  of rowing across the water
 and crashing that party.


  All doors would open for Monogram Monty.


  That was a long time ago.


  Aw, I'll row you over.


  How hard could it be?
  (Homer gasping for air)
  Oh, so hard.


  Would it help if I whipped you?
  Maybe.


  Yeah, a little.


  Yeah, yeah.


  (grunting)
  Yeah.

 (grunting)
    Whoa, it's a white party.


  Just the kind I used to throw.


  Although we interpreted the
 theme a bit differently
  in those days.


  Aah! 
  Got a whole lot of money,
 got a whole lot of money 
  Mm, whoever is throwing
 this magnificent to-do
  knows how to enjoy their wealth.


  Got a whole lot of money 
  Ooh, excessive.


  Tell me, where can I find our host?
  I haven't met him.


  No one has ever met him.


  He doesn't exist.


  Oh, he's upstairs in his office.


    Ooh.


  Are you the host of
 this incredible soiree?
  I must tell you, it's
 the most incandescent,
  most dazzling
  My name is Jay G.


  And nobody crashes my party.


  Not even you nobodies.


  (guns cock, Homer and Burns gasp)
  Let's go, Mr.

 Burns.


  What did you say?
  Mr.

 Burns and I were just leaving.


  Are you Montgomery Burns,
 the despised billionaire?
  Well, that's what my cuff links say.


  There's something I've wanted
 to tell you for a long time,
  you ruthless monster.


  (whimpers)
  - I love you.


 - (gasps)
  I can't believe I'm
 meeting the Monty Burns.


  How do you know me?
  You're the dude who wrote
 The Rungs of Ruthlessness.


  (chuckles) Yes, back then
 they'd give a book contract
  to any CEO with a power
 tie and a bonsai tree.


  When I was a boy, I found a copy
  left on the seat of a bus I stole.


  And after I read it, I knew I'd
 jacked my last courtesy shuttle.


  Your book became my bible.


  "Every empire needs an emblem.

"
  See? There you told me to find a symbol
  to represent my brand.


  And there he is, the living
 logo of Golden Goose Records,
  - Goosius.


 - (honks)
  You make me believe I can fly.


  Goosius is on everything
  from my cognac-flavored vodka
  to the brake pads I
 coproduced with Lil Wayne.


  Aw, he eats the same way I do,
  without swallowing.


  You've flown south for the
 winter with my heart.


  - (honks)
 - Ow!
  I hope this bite never heals.


  When I wrote an advice
 book, I never dreamed
  it would help anyone.


  Everything I am I owe to you.


  And a little bit to Baz Luhrmann.


  When I was born, our
 cupboards were barren 
  Now I'm inside of a blue McLaren 
  Blue McLaren? 
  They all be starin' 'cause 
  He's a hip-hop Vanderbilt 
  I'm so established 
  -  My life is fabulous
 -  Sugar trust.

 
    This.

 This is what I thought
 I'd never have again.


  Well, then good news, Monty.


  This is your party.


  HOMER: And so was forged the
 most unlikely of friendships.


  A man who discovered Rick Ross
  and a man who dated Betsy Ross.


  The next day, my family
 explored Middle Hampton.


  A wonderland of boutiques
  paid for by rich husbands
  wanting to keep their wives busy.


  Mainly second wives.


  WOMEN:  Hampton, ah, Hampton.

 
  What kind of crazy flavors are these?
  Quince jelly and pepper?
  Market greens?
  Bone broth brittle?
  I don't know what this place hates more,
  kids or ice cream.


  Really, man, a 3 Series?
  I mean, what is he?
  A sophomore at Exeter?
  Yeah, one cup of salted caramel.


  Woo-woo-woo, scoop with
 the stripe, stupid.


  (chuckling): I mean
  That kid just cut in line.


  Are you gonna let him do that?
  That's Blake Black.


  His dad runs BlackLake Investments.


  So?
  Richest dad rules?
  Everyone knows that.


  Well, I don't.


  Don't misunderstand me,
  Mats Wilander may have
 been a decent player,
  but until his inglÃ©s gets
 just a little bit better,
  he can coach somebody else.


  Pardon me a second.


  What is it, head points, what?
  Just because your father has money
  doesn't mean you can cut.


  Hmm, it kind of looks like it does.


  All right, I'll tell you what:
  because I am a nice guy,
  I am going to pay for everyone's cones.


  Is that okay? Does that make it okay?
  - Yeah!
 - Yes!
  No!
  I would never accept ice cream
  from someone whose manners are
 in the bottom one percent!
  (gasping)
  Boom.


  So, hey, hi.


  Are you going to the Allens'
  hot-dog-and-horseshoes thing later?
  No.


  The Forstmans' firefly thing?
  No.


  The Olins' jellyfish fry thing?
  I'm not going to any things at all!
  But I want to, um, hang out.


  What? Why?
  I've never met anyone like you before.


  Anyone with, you know, I don't know, um,
  morals.


  Oh.

 (giggles)
  Well, I guess it is a little judgy of me
  to be completely disgusted by you.


  Great, I'll set something up.


 Erin, are you on?
  Okay, I need to bail on the
 Kravises' freeze tag thing.


  No, I know, I have to.


  Send the big basket.


  What's wrong, honey?
  Lisa's got a rich boyfriend,
  Dad's hanging out with a
 hip-hop super producer,
  and I'm stuck window-shopping
  with you two fun-sucking stink buckets.


  It's not fair!
  Life's not fair, kid.


  Do I know you?
  If life was fair, you would know me.


  But know this: Jay G ain't all that.


  What do you mean?
  Buy a candle and I'll tell you.


  What's your cheapest one?
  $55.


  No way.

 I could start a fire
 in the woods for nothing.


  HOMER: So Bart met someone who
 I think comes back later.


  I forget why.


  Hmm.

 Who would have thought
 two billionaire Republicans
  from such different backgrounds
 could end up as chums?
  Is not green a more powerful
 color than black or white?
  The Lord picks a select few
 to accumulate more money
  than anyone else.


  You and I bear that sacred avarice.


  Each of my enterprises has its own G6.


  What's that one?
  That's for my (chuckles)
  personal horticulturalist.


  (chuckling): You know what I'm sayin'?
  I don't.


  You seem to get so much joy
  out of your money.

 I envy you.


  You've given me so much, Monty.


  Let me give you something back:
 the freedom to live large.


  A charge plate?
  I've never had one of those
 newfangled swipe-a-ma-jigs.


  It's an Obsidian Card,
 the most exclusive.


  No spending limit, no store
 has ever heard of it.


  But they have to accept it.


  Take it if you want to roll like G.


  Don't forget to sign it.


  Oh, right.


  No, no, not a felt-tip.


 Oh! It'll smudge.


  Okay, quick, blow on it to dry the ink.


  (both blowing)
  Blake, I have to say, this whale watch
  was a very thoughtful idea.


  (gasps) Oh, it's a whole family.


  But they're so far away.


  Far? Babe, when you whale watch with me,
  you sit pod-side.


  Fellas! What can we do here?
  This way, the whales know we are VIPs.


  Um, where's the baby?
  There's supposed to be a baby.


  I paid for a calf.


  Does that mean anything?
  Whale-copters? VIP pod-view?
  This is awful!
  Well, if we went on
 some lame econo-watch,
  we might not see blowhole one.


  I mean, what are you saying?
  Are you hearing yourself?
  Blake, I really believed
 you could change.


  And you did, you became
 even more horrible.


  (singing)
  (grunts)
  These aren't VIP emotions.


  This is worse than the time
  I had to eat grocery store sushi.


  The shiso leaf was plastic!
  (crying): It was plastic!
  JAY: You got to buy it, M.

B.

, it's fate.


  Oh, I don't know.


  $100,000 feels like a lot of money.


  You've got to splash the cash,
  fling the bling, spill them bills.


  It don't matter, just
 splatter the batter.


  Splash the cash.


  (grunting)
  Monogram Monty is back!
  I got a whole lot of money 
  A whole lot of money 
  -  What you want?  - 
 A whole lot of money 
  -  I got  -  A
 who-whole lot of money 
  - (honks)
 -  How much? 
  A whole lot of money 
  Whole lot 
  -  What's up?  -  Over here 
  -  What's up?  -  Over there 
  (bell clangs)
  (hoofbeats)
  I got a whole lot of money 
  A whole lot of money 
  -  What you want?  - 
 A whole lot of money 
  I got it 
  (honking)  When the night come on 
  I already know what time it is 
  She gon' drop.

 
  Now, what are you generous
 folks willing to pay
  for a basketball lesson
 with Charles Barkley?
  $10,000.


  $20,000.

 $30,000.


  Do I hear $50,000?
  $1 million.

 (whoops)
  M.

B.

, if you could only feel
 what I feel right now
  $1 million, going once, going twice
  $10 million!
  (crowd gasps)
  Sold!
  I just spent more money than I know
  on something I don't even want.


  And it's the greatest
 feeling I've ever had!
  (grunts weakly)
  Still better than Shaq.


  Mr.

 Burns was living the highlight.


  splurging on every luxury, even
 the ultimate indulgence
  useless hangers-on like me.


  Noice.


  To think, all the years I
 wasted without a posse.


  Good-bye, loneliness.


  We get all this stuff
  just for letting Mr.

 Burns
 beat us in mini golf.


  (chuckling): What a deal!
  My whole job is to not
 make eye contact with him.


  I thought I'd get tired
 of window-shopping
  in this fancy little town,
 but it ain't happening.


  A chessboard where the
 pieces are lipsticks!
  (gasps)
  (groans)
  (gasps) A horse show!
  (gasps) A protest!
  Huh?
  Blake, is that you?
  What happened to your privilege?
  I checked it.


  (gasps)
  Lisa, when you rejected me,
  I knew I had to do whatever it took
  to become worthy of you.


  This now runs on solar
 power and falafel.


  Now, that's sustainable!
  I've dedicated my entire allowance
  to Trustafarians for Horse Justice.


  Here's an upside down
 bucket for you to drum on.


  Well, what girl could say no
  to a socially conscious drum circle?
  Yo, lamp dress,
  I've got all access paddock
 passes to the horse show.


  Check out these sweet mane combs.


  I can get you up close to the horses
  for primo grooming time.


  ALL: Combing is murder!
  Combing is murder!
  Primo grooming time.


  HOMER: The test of a
 first-rate intelligence
  is the ability to hold
 two opposing ideas
  in the mind at the same time
  and still retain the
 ability to function.


  Horsey, horsey, horsey, horsey, horsey!
  For her, I gave up
 what meant most to me:
  being a douche.


  Mr.

 Burns, your bill came
 from the Obsidian Card.


  Are you sure you're not
 spending too much money?
  Hush, you sound like Smithers.


  Where is that loafer with my ice?
  (Smithers grunting, ringtone playing)
  (ringing stops)
  (groaning)
  - (horn honks)
 - Fill her up!
  And make it snappy.


  My best pal and I are going shopping
  for those yachts that have
 little submarines in them.


  Sir, your card was declined.


  (laughs) Goulash!
  Absolute goulash!
  It's linked to my bank account.


  I'd have to be penniless
  before that card didn't work.


  Well, then that means you're broke.


  Broke?
  (chuckles anxiously) Me?
  Broke? Me?
  Yes, I'm afraid I have
 to destroy your card.


  Good luck.

 It's tempered titanium
  and coated with powdered diamond.


  I ain't got no money 
  I ain't got no money.

 
  MOE: Don't take it.


  This car leased in someone
 else's name is who I am!
  My entire fortune, spent and gone.


  I splashed all my cash.


  Don't be so hard on yourself.


  It was your first credit card.


  And I handled it as well as a
 freshman at Michigan State!
  Mr.

 Burns, I think Jay wanted
 you to bankrupt yourself.


  Why would you say such a thing?
  It's number one on the charts.


    Used to be the man, Burns 
  Now you just a bad joke 
  Used to be about to die 
  Now you only dead broke 
  I gave you the card, Burns 
  And you spent your mind out 
  It was all a trap, yo 
  As you 'bout to find out 
  Jay G is CEO of Obsidian!
  - Biotch!
 - (honks)
  Now your bank account is withering 
  Your bottom lip is quivering 
  You're Hufflepuff, I'm Slytherin 
  There's no one doin' your Smitherin' 
  This is where your money went 
  Evict you from the one percent 
  Now watch me as my fingers tent 
  'Cause I own you, it is excellent 
  Excellent 
  You're broke now 
  Your cash was your passion 
  Now Jay owns your ass, son.

 
  (honks)
  If these rhymes are to be believed,
  Jay lured me into debt and
 now he owns everything.


  Even my beloved nuclear plant.


  Our magical friendship was a sham!
  HOMER: The loneliest
 moment in someone's life
  is when they're watching their
 whole world fall apart.


  And all they can do is stare blankly.


  Oh, no, wait, he's crying now.


 That's worse.


  Now he's really sobbing heavy.


  Oh, now he's gone to his knees
 and he ripped his shirt open.


  All of his buttons
 fell off of his shirt.


  Oh, now he's kicking his porch.


  Oh, he hurt his foot and
 he's hopping around.


  Oh, he tripped over a dog.


  (sobs)
  That's way worse.


  Montgomery Burns had hit rock-bottom.


  F.

 Scott Fitzgerald onde wrote:
  "There are no second
 acts in American lives.

"
  But he never said anything
 about second parts
  in American TV shows.


  I should've seen it all coming.


  My eyes were clouded by
 the cataracts of excess.


  And by an excess of cataracts.


  Wait.

 What happened to my posse?
  Don't you worry.

 A posse's
 loyalty is forever.


  Hey, Burnsie, I didn't get any
 brand-new sneakers today.


  I can't be wearing two-day-old sneakers.


  Hey, if there's no
 more money, we'll take
  our personalized bowling balls,
  fold-up bicycles, and go.


  (bicycles squeaking)
  (sighs)
  I'm here for my hounds.


  (growling)
  Huh! Preposterous.

 I raised
 those hounds from pups.


  I'm the only master they've ever known.


  One word from me and
 they'll rip you apart.


  Commence ripping!
  (snarling)
  (sniffing)
  (chuckles) Dogs can smell power.


  Sign this release legally
 releasing the hounds.


  If you don't, Mr.

 Jay G
 will release the hounds.


  Jay, I don't understand.

 I
 thought we were friends.


  We were going to open up a
 money-losing winery together.


  We can still hang out.

 Even
 though our owners are fighting.


  (honks)
  Not being bitten (cries)
  hurts the most.


  (sighs) Everyone's gone.


 Even Smithers never bothered
  to return from Canada with my lake ice.


  (alarm ringtone plays)
  (grunting)
  (cracking)
  Good Simpson.

 Faithful Simpson.


  You would never go back
 to the nuclear plant
  that was so cruelly taken from me.


  What does your heart say?
  HOMER: I looked deep into my heart,
  and it said
  Uh let me ask my wife.


  I don't care if Mr.

 Burns doesn't own
  the nuclear plant anymore.

 You
 still have to work there.


  You have a wife, a family,
  and a store to support.


  You're right, you're right.


  Wait.

 A store?
  I have a store.


  How did that happen?
  Well, you spend enough
 time in the Hamptons
  and you have any flair at all,
  you just wind up with a store.


  WOMEN:  What could possibly
 go wrong with retail? 
  Where should we put the
 19th century doctor's kits?
  Ooh, ooh! In the window next
 to the state-shaped erasers.


  But I feel bad leaving Mr.


 Burns.

 I'm all he's got.


  Can't we live off the
 money from your store?
  Oh, God, no!
  Right now I'm still building inventory.


  Luckily, the pincushion
 store across the street
  went out of business.


  I just swooped right in
 and bought up everything.


  Okay.


  HOMER: With my dear wife
 losing her marbles,
  I had to turn my back
 on poor, broken Burns
  and go to work at, well, the
 sexiest nuclear plant on Earth.


  Radioactive 
  R-R-R-Radioactive 
  Homer Simpson?
  Boss wants to see you.


  -  Booty like a power plant 
 - WOMAN: Hey, baby.


  You're blowin' up my pants,
 I like the way you dance 
  JAY: Mixtape coming soon, ladies.


  J-J-J-Jay's got the power! 
  (music continues in distance)
  "Rung six.

 To ensure
 an employee's loyalty,
  you must crush their
 attachments to the past.

"
  - (honks)
 - (knocking on door)
  You wanted to see me, Mr.

 G?
  Relax, Homer, we're good.


 When you entered my gates,
  I knew you'd turn your
 back on Old Man Burns.


  And I respect that.


  Yeah.

 I ditched him, all right.


  In his hour of need.


  But I feel good about it.


  Really good.


  (honking)
  Ow! Ow!
  Oh I missed that.


  Because I know you're so loyal to me,
  I have a very special job for you.


  Removing the last trace of Monty Burns
  from the power plant he loves.


  (whimpers)
  (grunts)
  Don't look at me.


  Stop looking at me!
  (grunts)
  You did good.


  Here's your reward.


  (gasps)
  Cobbler.


  I've got a granny in Atlanta who
 custom bakes them just for me.


  Peach, berry, cherry,
  rhubarb, pineapple.


  You can't cobbler pineapple.


  Yet here it is.


  (crying)
  Homie, what's wrong?
  (crying): I've never seen
 such beautiful cobbler.


  But there was a hole in me
 that even a thousand pans
  of hot fruit couldn't fill.


  I had betrayed Mr.

 Burns
 and felt sick about it.


  Searching for an open
 grave in which to barf,
  I heard a horrible sound,
  which I was strangely drawn towards.


  BURNS (coughing):  After
 the ball is over 
  After the break of dawn 
  After the dancers' leaving 
  After the stars are gone.

 
  Mr.

 Burns, what are you
 doing in this death hole?
  All I have left is my family mausoleum.


  Would you like a sip of grief soup?
  I stewed it from flowers left on graves.


  I confess, I went back
 to work at the plant.


  Jay G seduced me with cobbler.


  But after the eighth pan,
 it tasted like ashes.


  Ice cream got me through
 three more pans,
  but after that, ashes.


  Well, now you have to
 decide, once and for all,
  where your allegiance lies.


  I'm not going back to that job.


  I'm gonna stay here with you
 and we're going to get even
  with Jay G.


  And as God is my witness,
  I will not tell my wife what I'm up to.


  Oh, that's good.


  Come on, Simpson.


  Give me more ideas to get back at Jay G.


  - Fill his office with balloons?
 - Too soft.


  Fill his office with scorpions?
  Eh, I'm having a fight
 with my scorpion guy.


  Oh, oh, oh.

 Banana in his tailpipe.


  I can't afford a banana!
  (twig snaps)
  What's that? A spy! Grab him.


  Come here, spy.


  What are you doing here, boy?
  You're not dead.

 Are you?
  I followed you.

 I got suspicious
 when you came home last night
  covered in grave dirt.


  Be gone, urchin.

 We have work to do.


  Wait, wait! He can help.


  No one's better at nasty
 schemes than this kid.


  I mean, he's messed up.


  Look at him.

 You got to figure
 his family life's a disaster.


  Why should I help Burns
 now that he's broke?
  I've got more money than he does.


  Would the cape and gloves
  of the infamous Gaslight Strangler
  change your mind?
  If you want to take down a
 rapper, you got to destroy
  the thing that's most
 important to him: his rep.


  (whispering): Rep means reputation.


  To do that, we got to go
 to the ultimate expert
  on urban culture.


  A white nerd.


  So, in South Central
 Springfield in the '90s,
  there were four major
 hip-hop sub-scenes.


  The Good Time Mafia, Licorice Avenue,
  The Dirty, Dirty North, and The FLTA.


  The Fine Ladies Thug Army.


  Fascinating.


  Yes, yes.

 But do you have anything
  we can use against my
 sworn enemy, Jay G?
  Before he was Jay G,
 he was Jeremy Gilroy,
  a founding member of
 The Five Boyfriends,
  a soulful R&amp;B quintet.


  Hey, I know this guy.


  He tried to sell me a $55 candle!
  That's Jazzy James, the Lyrical Miracle.


  He wrote all of Jay's early hits.


  But they had a falling out,
  and he was never heard from again.


  Then only one man can write the rap
  that will ruin the rep of Jay G.


  Jazzy James.


  HOMER: I told you this
 guy would come back.


  Told you.


  Yeah, I used to be Jazzy James.


  The Lyrical Miracle?
  My skills were empirical.


  I wrote all the rhymes for Jay
 G's first hip-hop record.


  I didn't get a dime, because I
 signed over all the rights.


  Why'd you do that?
  (groans)
  All right, all right.


  I'll sign!
  He took my money, stole my girl,
  made me get a tattoo of the
 baseball from Major League.


  It broke me.

 I fell hard,
  into scented candles.


  (inhales deeply)
  (exhales) Quince.


  Listen, Jazzy.

 We're
 gonna tear down Jay G
  with the ultimate revenge rap.


  And you're gonna write it.


  Oh (grunts)
  (glass shatters)
  I'm in.


  Excellent.


  What is rap?
  Hmm?
  Hmm.


  Quick, boy! Hide this thing.


  (Bart grunting)
  Homie, it's so sweet of you
 to come visit me at my store.


  But aren't you gonna get in
 trouble for missing work?
  You let me worry about
 the nuclear plant.


  The important thing for you to do
  is believe I still work there.


  I can't wait to show you
 the changes I've made.


  We're getting a lot of foot traffic.


  Three people used the
 bathroom yesterday.


  How much should I charge
 for these handbags
  made from the speaker
 covers of old jukeboxes?
  Five dollars.

 No, no, no, no, no.


  A hundred dollars! (gasps)
  It's happening.

 It's happening.


  I love my store!
  We're putting up new wallpaper.


  (grunting)
  Is Mom gonna be okay?
  I don't know, son, I don't know.


  MAN: Oh, it's not her, fellas.


  It's the curse of the
 adorable little store.


  Didn't always used to be like this.


 No, no.


  Once, this land was
 full of actual stores,
  as far as the eye could see.


  Then the rich people came.

 They
 didn't need to make money,
  they just needed a place for
 their friends to wander into,
  after spin class.


  Yeah, that's progress for you.


  I suppose.


  HOMER: And so, with
 Jazzy James on board,
  Mr.

 Burns set out to produce
 the ultimate revenge rap.


  (hip-hop beat begins playing)
  Uh, listen up, suckers 
  I'm-a say how I feel 
  My dealings with Jay G have
 been less than ideal.

 
  I (sighs)
  It's It's no use.

 I've lost it.


  I need you to rap like
 your world is ending.


  Like you just found out
 that capital gains
  are going to be taxed at the
 same rate as ordinary income.


  I need you to put your
 entire soul into it.


  Now rhyme, Jazzy, rhyme!
  I got nothin'.

 Just take
 me back to my candles.


  I need my quince!
  Wait, I have another idea.


  I'm feelin' it!
  (laughs) I'm feelin' it!
  Now, almost drop me.


  (whoops) Why does this work?
    Jay, you're a rhyme thief 
  A hip-hop perjurer 
  If my words were beef patties 
  You'd be the Hamburglar 
  My beats are the freshest 
  My beats are the freshest 
  You reached out and stole 'em 
  Like Gollum did precious 
  Time for the truth to be paid off 
  You're a lyrical Madoff 
  So if you want to go to war, brah 
  Hit me up and I'll
 write the rap for ya.

 
  Yeah!
  Whoa, it rhymed!
  (laughs)
  Now that's what I call
  a corking revenge rap.


  If anyone's hungry, we've
 set up a deli platter
  in the lobby.


  I'm hungry!
  For gettin' what's mine.


  Oh.

 Ain't no deli platter
 ordered for a recording session
  that Praline doesn't hear about.

 Mm-mm.


  Praline? She's Jay G's ex-wife.


  I thought you were in prison.


  That's what the guards said,
  but I wasn't having that.


  Oh, we duckin' now?
  So that's how it is?
  (chuckles) I see.


  Oh, no, he didn't.


  No, he did not.


  - Shut up, Miata.


 - Oh.


  Put that rare roast beef in a baggie.


  Mm-hmm, that one.


  So, Praline, are you
 with us or against us?
  Jay G took everything from me.


  You best believe I'm going
 to take everything from him.


  Get the ham!
  We're really glad to have you.


  Thanks for your help.


  Who you thankin'?
  I'm not doing this for
 you, boo boo kitty.


  HOMER: With an angry
 ex-wife on our team,
  we were unstoppable.


  Praline brought in an all-star lineup
  of Jay G's enemies to lend their hatred
  to the world's greatest diss rap.


  RZA, Snoop and Common.


  Yo, I want to back-smack Jay G, son 
  He took that name Tang Clan from me 
  And since there couldn't be two 
  I had to change my Tang Clan to Wu 
  I seen Jay G pimp, lie and rob 
  Took my handyman off a job 
  And when I complained 
  All he did was laugh 
  Now I got half a gazebo,
 and not even the good half 
  I would never wish
 hate on my brother 
  'Cause we're all from the
 same celestial mother 
  Wait, I just remembered
 Jay crashed my Jet Ski.


  I hope he get food poisoning
 from nachos.

 Peace!
  Yo, Common, that was tight.


  Respect, 'House.


  Oh, when this track drops,
 some feelings gonna get hurt.


  Obliverated.


  Indeed.

 I just wish Smithers
 and his ice were here
  to witness my revenge.


  MEN (French Canadian accents):
 Fight, fight, fight.


  (men shouting)
  (growls)
  (grunts)
  (all gasping)
  (hip-hop playing)
  BURNS: Prepare for
  the turning of the worms.


  No offense, worms.


  I now drop "Choke on
 Diss," aka "Rhyme Crime,"
  by Hate Squad, featuring
 the Rhyme Crime All-Stars.


  Why isn't it dropping?
  Release the sounds!
  (honks)
  - (all gasping)
 - Damn!
  Sorry to crash your party
 as a hologram, M.

B.

,
  but I'm having a little
 celebration of my own.


  I just bought the master recording
  of your so-called diss rap.


  Ha, no way.


  Jazzy James and Hate Squad,
  featuring the Rhyme Crime
 All-Stars hate you!
  They'd never sell out.


  They would
  for money!
  Sorry, Monty.


  Jay G is the best producer in the world
  and you're a tone-deaf
 pauper who lives in a grave.


  Ouch.


  I thought I hated him, but now I don't.


  So now I'm here.


  If you can't handle a
 strong female hologram,
  that's on you.


  Jay G and D-O-double-G.


  We flipped the script.


  This ultimate betrayal
  is part of your spiritual journey.


  Lesson one: protect your neck.


  Say good-bye to your
 revenge rap forever.


  'Cause it's about to drop.


  (gulps, honks)
  Mmm.

 (kisses)
  Party at the power plant, y'all.


  I swear on the squid
 beak of Lord Cthulhu
  and all his briny shoggoths,
  I will get revenge on you, Jay G.


  HOMER: And so Mr.

 Burns beat on,
  fists against the hologram,
  punching back ceaselessly
 into his own face.


  Which new name do you like better?
  Next Doorables
  (gasps) or the Lavender Zeppelin?
  I just don't know anymore.


  (door opens, bell rings)
  (gasps) A customer!
  Oh, it's you.


  Baby, I'm sorry.


  I stayed loyal to Mr.

 Burns,
  coproduced a failed revenge rap,
  and now we've got nothing.


  (gasps)
  I know it's crazy, but he needed me.


  Oh, it's okay, Homie.


  You're not mad?
  Your heart told you to stick with Mr.


 Burns,
  and the thing I love about you most
  is you've got a heart
 as big as The Ritz.


  Wow, Mom, you just made an F.


 Scott Fitzgerald reference.


  Lisa, please, I did
 graduate high school.


  (sighs)
  I've just hatched a plan for
 the most delicious revenge.


  Simpson, we must away.


  Did you want to buy that?
  Just looking.


  We can't afford the store anymore!
  Oh, thank God.


  Ha! I'm free!
  (grunts)
  Well, before long, another aimless soul
  will open another adorable store here.


  And when they do, Old
 Sam the Sign Hanger
  will be ready, with his
 level and his ladder.


  Oh, why, here comes one now.


  Oh, honey, isn't it darling?
  - Huh?
 - (laughs)
  We finally found the Bookmark Barn.


  - (cackling)
 - Oh, this is Wicker Works.


  We're gonna sell so
 many Yorkie sweaters.


  We can use the contractor
 that did Karen's store.


  HOMER: Mr.

 Burns' plan
 was so horrifying,
  I could barely shut up
 and go along with it.


  But I was the only friend
 he had left in the world
  and he was whipping me so hard.


  Ow, ow!
  Oh, Goosius.


  Daddy's got your oatmeal.


  Golden raisins, just the
 way you like 'em, baby.


  Goosey!
  (tires screech)
  Where's my goose?
  Why, he's right here.


  Fancy a bite of roast Goosius?
  You didn't!
  (laughing): Oh, I did.


  Mmm.

 A trifle fatty,
 but other than that,
  excellent.


  Damn, I didn't think you
 had it in you, M.

B.


  (sobbing): Oh, man.


  I don't want to live in a world
  without the mascot of my
 multinational empire.


  (sobs)
  (Goosius honking, Homer grunting)
  Stop it!
  I saved your life, you stupid duck!
  Simpson, I told you to cook his goose.


  I couldn't do it.


  We just had our portrait done.


  (honks)
  Then, what did I eat?
  Roast goose from the gas station.


  - Fine, then I'll kill it myself.


 - (gasps)
  (honking)
  HOMER: The two rivals found
 themselves doomed by the lusts
  that drive all men money, power,
  and the pursuit of a goose.


  (groans)
  (honking)
  Damn it, Monty, I don't want to die.


  Well, if we have to end this way,
  at least it's of natural causes.


  A business deal gone wrong.


  (creaking)
  (shouts)
  Tell me, Jay.


  Why'd you betray me?
  We were kindred souls.


  Brothers in avarice.


  Why? Because you told me to!
  In your own last chapter.


  "You will never be truly ruthless
  until you destroy the one who made you.

"
  I had to tear you down, M.

B.

!
  It was the final rung.


  (creaking)
  I just wanted to be ruthless,
  like you.


  That I inspired you to
 such pure and evil greed,
  that is my greatest triumph.


  I am truly immortal.


  We're about to die, fool.


  (yelling)
  Smithers, I ordered ice, not slush.


  Sorry I'm late, sir.


  A few of these French Canadian bikers
  got delayed at the border.


  Apparently, I'm their leader now.


  Smithers, Smithers, Smithers!
  (chuckles)
  Ow.

 That stings.


  Oh, that one's nice.


  How dare you.


  Fascinating.


  BOTH: Excellent.


  HOMER: Mr.

 Burns realized
  that his ruthless will to power
  would beat on forever
 in another man's heart.


  Ah, I guess this summer's really over.


  (crying): I'm gonna miss Goosius.


  Aah!
  Thanks, boy.


  Do you think Mr.

 Burns learned
 anything from all this?
  Could it have changed
 him for the better?
  You know what?
  I have a feeling it did.


  BURNS (over P.

A.

): Attention.


  For the sheer joy of it,
  every day will now include a
 moment of musical appreciation.


  Yeah!  Music makes the whole world 
  Whole world 
  Mm, let's not do this tomorrow.

  from the writing team of
  A team?!
    - Beep-beep, beep-beep.


 - Beep-beep, beep-beep.


  Objects may be sexier than they appear.


  (growls)
  That's it.

 I'm leaving.


  Take me! You'd slow me down!
  Lisa Simpson here,
 covering the Surly Awards
  for Springfield Elementary
 School Radio, WSES.


  Ooh, here comes an audience member now.


  One guy in the In Memoriam reel
 was alive when it started!
  Don't forget your gift bag!
  It's just a coupon for a
 dollar off at the car wash,
  but if you don't have one,
 the lady at the car wash
  will give you one from out of a drawer!
  - (tires screech)
 - Homie, come back!
  You're the next presenter!
  The winner is me 'cause I'm leaving!
  Stomach filled with rage.


  Must quench with French fries.


  Five Krusty Burgers.

 No tomato.


  Sorry, sir.

 We no longer
 serve Krusty Burgers.


  But it's your name! It's as
 if Macy's didn't sell Mace!
  Our corporate parent in Kumamoto, Japan,
  has instituted the following fun
 and nonnegotiable changes
  Hey, hey! Try our Buttermilk
 Sriracha Sandwich,
  Kobe Shiitake Ciabatta Explosion,
  and Hanoi Honey Barbecue
 Banh Mi Pho-furter.


  Get 'em quick, before they're Sai-gone!
  (laughs)
  Oh, I just want a one-pound burger
  that a snake couldn't
 fit its mouth around.


  Sorry.

 We no longer
 sell the Python Buster.


  Would you like some Kombucha
 Kimchi Mini Tacos instead?
  Just give me a cup.


  That's beet aioli.


  No!
  People! Beware! The crap you love to eat
  has been replaced by food!
  (tires screech)
  (tires screech)
    Heavenly Father, I know you're
 a friend of the eating man.


  You created Sunday so
 we can have brunch.


  Please, O Lard, shower me
 with your divine grease
  and deliver me some egg rolls.


  Or pizza or hot dogs.

 Whatever
 I can eat while driving.


  For thine is the flower
 and the gravy forever.


  A menu
  would be great.


    (gasps) Thank you.


  Help you?
  Um, what's the healthiest
 thing in this place?
  (whoops)
  Chewie, we're home.


  Chewie is what I call my mouth.


  I really don't care what
 you call your mouth.


  Ah.


  Just in time for breakfast.


  Hi, guys.


  So, Homie, I'm sure you
 have a good explanation
  - for where you were.


 - The best.


  I was eating hot dogs.


  Hot dogs? (scoffs)
  That is so stupid it must be the truth.


  I bet you're picturing me
 as a hot dog right now.


  Absolutely not!
  (chuckles)
  And these weren't just any hot dogs
  they were Deuce's Caboose chili dogs!
  We were worried sick!
  What do you think we are,
  man?
  Take that.


  Ow! No fair!
  She nut-butted me.


  (chuckles) Deuce's Caboose, eh?
  We used to take you there
 when you were a boy.


  I don't remember any of that.


  Well, you were young then,
 and you're stupid now.


  Your mom and me dropped you off
 there every Wednesday afternoon
  while we tuned up our marriage.


  Turn here.


  Oh, you just love to tell me what to do.


  We come here every week,
 and you get lost.


  - Please stop fighting.


 - Oh, you would just love it
  if we did that, wouldn't you?
  He'll take a small soda and
 sit there for 50 minutes.


  Hey, kid, have a chili dog,
  on the house.


  If we split up, no one gets Homer!
  ("Flower Duet" playing)
  That's when I started
 eating my emotions.


  Oh.

 You poor guy.


  Fat-man begins.


  Well, it taught me a great coping skill.


  Eating is to me what drinking is to me.


  (chuckles) I just wish I had
 something aggravating in my life
  to make me hungry now.


  Hello! (gasps)
  Uh, Homie, Patty and Selma
 lost their jobs at the DMV,
  because they spent too
 much on the award show.


  We went over the $43 budget.


  By $100,000.


  To save money, I said they
 could live here for a while.


  And don't forget, we have
 a baby and an iguana.


  And they both have
 different sleep schedules.


  What they do have in common is diarrhea.


  And we forgot to bring diapers.


  Hey.

 You remember me as a kid, right?
  No, sir.


  But you called me your
 "Little H-Dog," remember?
  Look, man, I'm getting up there.


  I can barely remember
 the starting lineup
  of the 1961 Chicago Blackhawks.


  Uh, Bobby Hull; Al Arbour;
  Ed Litzenberger, captain;
  Stan Mikita; and that's all.


  Also, Dollard St.

 Laurent.


  But not you.


  I'm sorry, sir.


  MARTIN: Okay, people,
  what have you got? We're being killed
  in the ratings by the
 morning announcements.


  SKINNER: Attention,
  the bus that took 30
 kids on a "field trip"
  was not from this school.


  If anyone's mom can go pick
 up 30 students in Chinatown,
  it would be much appreciated.


  Why didn't we break that story?!
  Damn it, we're even being
 beaten by Jimbo's podcast.


  Today on Left, Right &amp; Center,
 we'll discuss whether
  to punch someone in the
 left, right, or center.


  Our special guest today
  is upside-down nerd,
 Milhouse Van Houten.


  Thanks for having me back.


  Aren't we just supposed
 to do the stories we want
  and not worry about ratings?
  That's kindergarten talk.


  This is professional fourth-grade radio.


  (knocking)
  Meeting's over.


  I've got to put the balls back in.


  I'm the smartest ball in the bag.


  You could be replaced,
 and it wouldn't be hard.


  A cinder block with a stretched-out belt
  would do the trick.


  (engine revving, tires squealing)
    No one's eating at my place.


  No one!
  I'm a self-hating chew.


  Hot dog! 
  Life is tasting pretty good 
  Oh, yeah 
  Hot dog 
  'Cause you love me like you should 
  Oh, yeah 
  So put some mustard on my roll 
  'Cause you're barking up my soul 
  Hot dog 
  -  I like to see you walk 
 -  Beef log 
  I like to hear you talk 
  -  Food blog 
 -  I really relish you 
  - What rhymes with relish?
 -  Who could embellish you? 
  - (Homer whoops)
 - BOTH:  Hot dog 
  -  Hot dog 
 -  Hot dog 
  Hot dog 
  Don't know what's inside of you 
  Hot dog! 
  (laughter)
  Ah.

 I still don't remember you, man.


  LISA: Here at Springfield Elementary,
  detention has many names.


  Purgatraz, The Skinner
 Sheraton, Spitball Alley,
  The Bully Pen, 311 Worth,
  Little Devil's Island
  and Dead Man Chalking.


  And I am here with the legendary
 Nurple Purpler Nelson Muntz.


  Yo.

 Nelson, let me get right to it.


  Haw-haw!
  Where did that come from?
  Um wow.

 First of all, great question.


  I guess I just saw a jerk
 doing something lame,
  and I wanted to make the
 dope feel like a dingus.


  Well, Mr.

 Muntz, I just happen
 to have one of those "dingi"
  right here.


  Milhouse, how does it feel
 to get a full Nelson?
  The first haw isn't that bad.


  But the second one is devastating.


  Wow! Wow!
  Sorry, Lisa.

 Funding has run
 out for our radio station.


  I'm, uh, gonna have to
 take back your hat.


  What?! Jeff and Becky broke up!
  Just before the story of the year!
  What's wrong, sweetie?
  They took away my radio station,
  which was the only source
 of news in a 50-foot area.


  You could come with me
 to the hot dog stand
  and do the word search
 on the kids' menu.


  Do they have diagonals?
  Diagonals! That's where
 "race car" was hiding.


  Oh, no, the hot dog stand is closed!
  The place I forgot for 30 years is gone!
  There's always a weak link.


 There's always a weak link!
  (groaning)
  We should help that man.

 He's choking.


  I remember when you used to
 help me when I was choking.


  Why don't you ask the
 girl at the hiking store?
  I gave her my number because
 I was ordering boots.


  Don't let it be forgot
 that on this shining spot
  was a place I really ate a lot.


  I don't see how you can blame
 a man of 97 for retiring.


  - I thought we were the same age.


 - So did I.


  Well, I hope you didn't
 sell it to some clown.


  (Krusty's theme song playing)
  Here's a check.


  Welcome to the Krusty Burger family.


  And since we're family, we don't talk!
  Next problem.


  Oh! What else are you gonna change?
  We're gonna keep everything that
 makes Deuce's Caboose great.


  Like the hot dogs and the caboose?
  No.

 God, no.

 We're already
 talking to C-list actors
  about playing the owner in commercials.


  We're trying to find a
 cheap Garrett Morris.


  (creaking, engine starting)
  Hot dogs, come with me
 if you want to live!
  (engine revving)
  Somebody, stop them!
  (Krusty's theme song plays in reverse)
  That better be a monkey's
 tail I'm feeling.


  Uh, chimps have no tails.


  Chimps have no tails?!
  Dad, what are we doing?!
  I'm saving a precious childhood memory!
  You realize this will
 be my childhood memory,
  and maybe not so precious?
  That's a problem for grownup Lisa.


  All right, then.


    I certainly hope that isn't
 your father's hot dog caboose.


  I have no end game!
  Oh, Lord! He's on the news so much,
  he has his own theme music now.


  Go, Homer, go! 
  Never know what he's gonna do! 
  Kent Brockman with you.


  You're watching Channel
 6 Super Team Coverage
  of Chili Dog Day Afternoon
 Weiner on a Roll.


  Indeed.


  Basically, I'm just watching
 it like the rest of you.


  I guess you'd like some kind
 of commentary or perspective.


  I don't have any, but I'd
 like you to remember
  you're watching Channel 6
 the one that doesn't cut away
  when somebody dies.


  (siren wailing)
  Chief Wiggum, maybe I can
 defuse the situation.


  De-fuse.

 Huh.


  Well, there's a first
 time for everything.


  Can you hand me your mic?
  Every police regulation says "no,"
  but do you know what says "yes"?
  What? Your eyes.


  Aw.


  This is Lisa Simpson,
 a name you can trust,
  and I'm with Homer Simpson, a
 man who just stole a caboose.


  My father is on quick-sided quest
  to save a greasy spoon
 from being licked.


  I have to save that
 caboose full of hot dogs,
  which is what my father called me.


  This aggression shall not
 stand, so let us ride!
  Say, Colonel, which army were you in?
  Never you mind which army I was in
  and which courthouse we surrendered at.


  I said let's ride!
  I guess that's it
  the one freeway chase
 that ends in failure.


  No, it has not!
  We shall overeat!
  (dramatic music playing)
  (upbeat instrumental music plays)
  (dramatic music playing)
  ALL: Yay!
  D'oh!
  I'm sorry, Dad.

 It's over.


  No, it's not!
  (soft squeak)
  Krusty, run regular!
  I forgot how!
  (creaking)
  So that's what it's for.


  No! I can't let my Little H-Dog die!
  (gasps) You do remember me!
  I never forgot you! How could I?
  (creaking)
  You were such a sweet,
  sad little boy, and I failed you.


  - No, you didn't.


 - Yes, I did!
  You needed a father, and
 all I could give you
  was steamed tubes filled
 with chicken asses.


  But I love those chicken asses!
  I love you.


  (both crying)
  Your chili dogs didn't get me
 through my childhood.

 You did!
  Suddenly this hot dog-covered
 locomotive seems like a joke!
  Take my hand, son.


  It's strong from turning a can opener.


  Your chili was store-bought?!
  I didn't say I paid for it.


  (explosion)
  - Mmm! - Oh, yeah!
 - Ooh!
  - Oh!
 - Ooh, yeah, baby!
  You're a hero, Dad!
  They're calling you Public
 Elephant Number One!
  Well, I guess that's better than
  "Local Man Cut Out of Dressing Room.

"
  It sure is, Dad.

 It sure is.


  Chief, why are you letting him leave?
  He just committed a
 series of serious crimes.


  Forget it, Lou.

 It's Chili Town.


  ("Chinatown" theme music plays)
  (distant siren wails)
  Gentlemen, I'm-a so tired
 of all the bad-a blood
  between our companies.


  Can't we have a peace of pizza?
  What are you doing?
  You fools!
  I'm a real person in here!
  (taps playing)
       


                





                    			1
 Whoa, look out.


  Hey, where's our sailboat?
  Oh.

 It really tied the room together.


  Yes.

 That painting was great.


  Derivative, amateur seascape.


  Maybe another animated show stole it!
  We'll see about that!
  Or maybe I sold it on Craigslist.


  Both things are equally possible.


  This a TV show,
  or did I walk into a third
 grade shoebox diorama?
  Did you steal my painting?
  Out of the mouths of babes.


  We're in the cookies you hate to eat 
  An unpleasant surprise
 when you trick-or-treat 
  Boo! Boo!
  Snacks should be bad for you!
  Ew, what smells like comic
 books and loneliness?
  Oh, uh, certainly not this cool cat.


  Nope.

 That was spot-on.


  But today I don't care.


  - Look what I got!
 - My painting!
  The piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance of
 my memorabilia collection!
  Not since I was the winning bidder
  on a Ziploc full of Jonathan
 Frakes' beard trimmings
  have I been so Aw, dang it.


  Ooh! Gross! Raisin blood!
  Oh, I did it.


  Oh, (bleep).


  Bart and I haven't always
 been the best of friends.


  Aah!
  And we're here to tell
 you a story of a time
  when we really didn't get along.


  But we found our way!
  And we like each other better than ever!
  Way to spoil the ending, nerd-burger.


  Mmm, nerd-burger.


  It all began on the
 hottest summer on record.


  Aah!
  After years of pollution
 in Springfield Bay,
  I am honored to announce
 that these waters
  are now safe to swim in.


  Huzzah for a cleaner Springfield!
  Er, uh, it's not cleaner.


  We just lowered the safety standards.


  Yay!
  Okay, who's up for a day at the beach?
  I got all the beach I want
 with Anzio Beach Invasion.


  Pathetic! I was there, and
 it was nothing like that.


  I surrender!
  I'll go in first so they
 won't know it's a trap.


  Yoink.

 Yoink.


  Movado!
  Well, that is the most disgusting thing
  I've ever seen on a beach.


  Kind of sad, really.


  A booger?
  Real mature, guys, real mature.


  A booger!
  A human booger, indeed.


  Dolphin.

 Weak.


  Skull.

 ClichÃ©.


  "I'd rather be fishing.

" Not true.


  The bone?
  That's exactly what I'm bad to.


  Hmm.


  I'll take it!
  Geronimo!
  It said "water-resistant.

"
  It resisted nothing!
  Whee!
  Whoa! Dope hat!
  And check out my gnarly new tat!
  No fair! I'm bad to the bone!
  - Mmm!
 - Okay, that's it.


  Marge, I'm watching sports!
  Really? What's the score?
  Uh, the, uh, Boobs are
 beating the Butts.


  I don't think that's the
 official terminology.


  Oh!
  Maybe you should watch
 this sport instead.


  Hmm.


  Mm-mm-mm.


  What do you know?
  Checkmate.

 Ha!
  It's the only mate I haven't buried.


  Hey, Blobby Fischer, you're up.


  Do you even know the
 names of the pieces?
  Of course.

 There's the King,
  Mrs.

 King, the Lightbulb Babies,
  the Mini Ashtray, Slit Face.


  And who could forget Dr.

 Horse?
  Want to put a 20 on it?
  Make it a 22.


  Checkmate.


  Another victim
 of the Budapest Gambit.


  How can Dad play chess?
  He can't even remember the
 rules to Chutes and Ladders.


  - I do so!
 - You always think ladders go down.


  You can go down a ladder.


  Oh, God, not this again.


  - I go down ladders all the time.


 - Homer, when did you learn to play chess?
  The truth is, my dad and I used to play.


  He won't stop doing it.


  That's jive, man.


  But I don't want to talk about it.


  Whoa! Sweet lid, Lisa.


  Well, I'm bad to the bone.


  I see no proof of that.


  Oh, yeah? Just look at this.


  Haw-haw! Bart's getting
 beat up by a beach turkey!
  Hmm.


  Okay, a few ground rules.


  Everything I say, I want five of.


  Five Krusty Burgers
  Got it.


 Five Krusty Burgers.


  No! I thought I was clear.


  25 Krusty Burgers!
  125 Krusty Burgers?
  No! That's not what I Fine.


  Can I really toss this
 thing she's so crazy about?
  Damn right I can! I'm bad to the bone!
  Who the hell are you?
  I'm your guilt.


  I don't have any guilt.


  You do now.


  Don't worry, Bart.

 I'll protect you.


  I'm denial.


  Ay, caramba!
  My hat!
  Sunny?
  Uh, no.


  Uh-uh.


  Oh.


  No.


  Nope.


  Not even close.


  Do you have any more yellow hats?
  You mean like the one you
 looked really good in?
  - Yes.


 - No.


  Oh
  You're still here?
  No offense, but you look worse.


  Your lack of remorse just makes me grow.


  Now you're gettin' it.


  Ha! Joke's on you
 I like gross things.


  Hmm.


  Again! Again!
  And that leads to mate
  in three!
  I've got to say, it's so exciting
  to find out something new about you.


  Hey, I'm full of surprises.


  Ooh.

 Name another.


  Actually, that's it.


  Tell me something I
 don't know about you.


  Okay.


  Sometimes when I sweep, I
 make little sweeping noises
  with my mouth.


  Oh, here comes the dustpan.


  I can't find Sunny anywhere.


  Sunny? No! We got to find Sunny!
  Where Wait.


  The baby's name is Maggie.


  Hey, beach bums.

 Man,
 did I crash last night.


  Always sleep well after
 riding the waves.


  Ah
  Have you seen your sister's hat?
  Oh, did-did she have a hat?
 I-I don't remember any hat.


  Her name was Sunny, and I loved her more
  than any girl ever loved a hat!
  Even Madeline
 from the Madeline books?
  She only wore that because
 it was part of her uniform.


  Ask Pepito.


  Mmm.


  Hey, hey, hey, I do not like to
 see that going on in my bar.


  Lenny, knight takes queen.


  Barney, mate in four.


  Homer! You're playing like
 Polugaevsky at Mar del Plata.


  Yeah, Homer, you're some
 kind of a idiot savant.


  Hey, I don't come here to be insulted.


  Homer, we're just saying
 youse got a special skill,
  like a smokin' monkey or a
 urinal cake with an ad on it.


  Don't tell me you're not
 flattered by those analogies.


  You guys think you're so hot.


  I could fit in a piece
 of carry-on luggage.


  Oh-ho, I'd like to see that.


  Mm-hmm.

 Mm-hmm.


  Oh, no.

 I'm alone with my thoughts.


  No.

 No, no, no.

 The healthiest
 thing is for me to let myself out.


  Oh, sure thing, pal.


  Here you go.


  So, Homer, how did you
 get so good at chess?
  I played against my dad.


  Uh, was that fun?
  It was, until I learned the
 pieces weren't licorice.


  We played every day after
 my mother left us,
  and he won every time.


  And every time he won, he
 laughed that horrible laugh.


  Aw, Mona.


  So I found a professor
  who lived nearby,
  a master of the game, kind, patient,
  devoted to me.


  I went every day.


  You are ready now.


  Thanks for the lessons, Professor.


  You remind me of my son.


  - Oh.

 Where is he now?
 - He's
  right over there.


  He just doesn't like chess.


  I went back to play my dad.


  We had a beautiful thing here,
  and you had to ruin it by getting good!
  No more chess in this house!
  But, Dad, it's our thing.


  Well, we'll find another thing.


  You listen to the radiator
 hiss while I drink whiskey
  under this naked lightbulb.


  It was a sad life, but
 I wasn't affected.


  They fight and fight and fight 
  Fight, fight, fight,
 fight, fight, fight 
  The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show.

 
  I brought you more lasagna, cousin.


  Mmm.


  You know these cartoons are made
  by exploiting Korean children?
  You ruin everything.


  Bart? What is it?
  Um, listen, I have I
 have to tell you something.


  I-I was jealous, and I-I
 threw your hat away.


  Oh, that went a lot
 better than I thought.


  - Why did you do it?
 - I don't know.


  The important thing is you
 got to forgive me right now.


  I feel kind of guilty.


  Then I hope your guilt will grow
  and grow
  and grow.


  And no matter how much you
 try to pretty it up
  it'll still be the most hideous
 thing you could imagine!
  Nerds! Get 'em!
  A cupcake? Please.


  No.


  Mm-mm.


  So what?
  I'm truly sorry, Bart,
  but it's a wound nothing can heal.


  A bunny and a hammer?
  Well, my mom did say bring home dinner.


  Homer, listen, hey,
  I got something very scary to tell you.


  Now, I was on this
 alt-suicide subreddit,
  you know, just-just checking in,
  and I found out why you
 are so good at chess.


  Go on.


  Chess represents your
 desire to kill your father.


  What the? That's ridiculous!
  Now, I'm here to bowl!
  You'll end up in the gutter!
  Oh, my head!
  Oh! I'll sue!
  I can't afford the copay!
  Won't someone reset us!
  Well, at least I'm safe.


  I'm in luck! It's still here!
  My hat!
  Aah! My car! And my house.


  Homer, before you give up,
  I Skyped someone who knows
 a little bit about chess.


  Oh, I don't think any chess master
  or even international master
 could understand how I feel.


  I'm world chess champion Magnus Carlsen.


  I understand Norwegian!
  When I heard a fellow chess
 player had a mental problem,
  I Skyped at once.


  I'm not a chess player anymore.


  From now on, I'm only playing Stratego!
  I cannot play Stratego
 I'm scared of the bomb.


  Yeah, tell me about it.


  Homer, I'm afraid you
 cannot run away from chess.


  The reason I got into chess
  was because it didn't involve running.


  I share your disdain for exercise.


  Now I will say something
 with all the emotion
  a Norwegian can muster.


  To find your true feelings,
  you must finish your final
 chess match with your father.


  I'm sorry, you cut out for a second.


  Did you gasp?
  Then you will nod.


  Then you will eat a piece of cheese
  while the wife doesn't look.


  Then you will undo the top
 button of your pants.


  I'm always three moves ahead.


  D'oh!
  Okay, I don't have to move the cube.


  I just have to get the hat out.


  Ga-der!
  I never thought I'd sink this low,
  but I need help from God.


  Let our faith lift up this cube, Lord.


  - - Huh?
  Aw.


  Thanks for nothing.


  Huh? The soda ate right
 through the metal!
  I'm just glad I'm not a car.


  Ah.

 I just have to get more.


  Hit it, boys!
  And evil thoughts.


  Boys, are you performing miracles?
  Jesus is performing them through us.


  Well, all right, then.


  I'm here to play chess,
 we're gonna play chess,
  - and not another word!
 - I play chess?
  An excellent move by Homer.


  A stout defense by Grampa.


  Doesn't anyone want to
 watch the Super Bowl?
  Get lost!
  Homer has the win in hand.


  He merely needs to take Grampa's knight.


  Oh, he's gonna be a new man.


  A new man, you hear me?
  Can I go? It's, like, 4:00 a.

m.

 for me.


  Sure.

 Fine.


  Uh, who is that guy?
  Magnus Carlsen my cousin.


  Isn't a father more
 important than a victory?
  I've never really known either.


  You resign?!
  Dad, Dad, it seems I love you.


  Can't you say it seems you love me, too?
  Aw
  my son loves me.


  Now I can die in peace.


  Really?
  Hold your horses!
  Lisa! Stupid Lisa!
  I've got something to show you!
  I found Sunny!
  I don't want the hat anymore.


  What? You really don't have
 any choice in the matter.


  Here! I told you,
  the wound won't heal.


  Your best bet is to forget me
 and start fresh with Maggie.


  She likes raisins, Bart.


 Give her raisins.


  He's trying to be nice.


  Now what's your problem?
  Oh, shut up! I forgive you!
  You forgive me?
  Yes.

 In the right hat,
 anything is possible.


  Why does everyone feel
 so good when I leave?!
  Ooh-hoo-hoo! This will come in handy.


  What's going on here?
  Bart and I are friends again.


  I do some
 of my best fathering
  when I'm not around.


  - Hey, who are you?
 - Oh, you'll find out.


  Listen, pal,
  I have plenty of demons.

 Get in line.


  - How you doing?
 - Drunk!
  Hey, I thought you were sloth.


  Sloths can be drunk.


  So we learned Bart has a conscience.


  Haw-haw!
  You have a conscience!
  Closed set!
  My mom's dating your gaffer.


  Jack! Is that true?
  I'm not proud of it.


  You seemed pretty proud when
 you ate all our ramen noodles.


  Listen, I got to know.

 Do you
 chess guys get groupies?
  Homer, I wish you could stop.


  These Skypes aren't free.


  Yes, they are.


  I still don't want to talk to you.


      


                





                    			1
 Hey.


  D'oh!
  Aw.


  And that's amore.


  Let the word go forth.


  With the kids
 gone for the summer,
  we have snuggled
 in every room in the house.


  Thank you, Kamp Krusty.


  Um, excuse me.


  Um, putting on a little
 weight there, huh, Chief?
  Our freezer broke, Lou.


 Any bacon we buy
  we have to eat it all
 and right away.


  Uh, now, Simpson, we received
 an anonymous call about a gong.


  Chief Wiggum, can't a man enjoy
  the company of his wife
 in his own son's tree house?
  What, you didn't
 see the sign?
  Hmm?
  That's just some nonsense
 a kid wrote, Chief.


  That is what they said
  about the Declaration
 of Independence, Lou.


  Uh, who said that?
  King Shut The Hell Up.


  Look, we're married.


  This is our home,
 and our kids are fine.


  Hail to thee, Kamp Krusty.

 
  Death to tennis camp!
  I can't believe
 it's been six weeks
  since we've seen the kids.


  Ooh, I wonder
 if Bart has a mustache.


  Your kids are back.


  Except for the Johnsons', who
 I need to speak to privately.


  I have
 lemon-lime disease!
  The basketball teams
 were skin versus bones.


  I'm tellin' ya,
 it was a real rough camp.


  I see you're sucking
 your thumb again.


  Kirk, you said
 he'd stopped.


  Uh
  Kirk, we discussed this.


  It's the only vice
 I can afford!
  Oh, my poor, poor babies.


  Do you know what kids get
 after a scary experience?
  Ice cream!
  No.

 Counseling.


  Aw.


  Kids, you've been through
 a horrible experience,
  but there is good news at
 the end of that pain-bow.


  A pot of goals.

 All right.


  How long you gonna
 talk this way?
  Well, let's just say
 I wish eyes were smiling.


  Now, kids,
  how bad could it have
 really been?
  Hey, Doc, I'm fine.


 But other kids in my generation,
  I love 'em,
 but they're total wusses.


  Well, every night, they
 showed us The Parent Trap.


  I mean, what kind of
 parents break up twins
  and never tell them
 the other exists?!
  Oh, that's Disney magic.


  Now, you all need
 to decompress,
  so it is essential you do not
 go right back to school.


  No school?
 No school?
  On second thought, I'm fine.


  Look, I can sit
 with my chair turned around,
  just like you.


  I knew one day
 there'd be another.


  Go.

 Go with God.


  Bart, are you coming?
  Ooh, definitely
 no school for you.


  Or church.


  Mrs.

 Simpson,
 I would watch him very closely
  for the next couple
 of days.


  Geez, I was thinking
 about taking him shopping
  for school clothes.


  Why not just buy a suit
 for his coffin.


  Oh.

 Oh, okay.

 Sorry.


  Uh, somebody
 parked me in.


  Toyota Corolla.


  Well, it's got to be
 one of you.


  Try the karate studio.


  I tried the damn
 karate studio.


  All right, it's me.


 I blocked you in.


  Okay? Sorry.


  Okay,
  time to fake me some PTSD.


  And maybe bloodshot eyes.


  Eh, too far.


  Oh, I don't
 know, Homie.


  The kids seem upset.


  Oh, they'll be fine.


  Marge, children and summer
 are natural enemies.


  Now, why don't we
 mix things up?
  Tonight I'll be Penn
 and you be Teller.


  Oh, okay!
  Uh! Teller doesn't talk.


  Ooh.


  Mom! Dad!
  I'm scared.


 I can't sleep.


  I'm sorry, Homie.


 Bart's ten.


  That could be the last tear
 that ever comes out of him.


  He's sleeping here.


  Take a hike, homeboy.


  What the hey?
  Just giving him
 his allowance.


  This pamphlet on trauma
 they gave Bart is very alarming.


  Loss of appetite?
 Thousand-yard stare.


  I'm not hungry.


 Where are you looking?
  A thousand yards away.


  No school for you, young man.


  I'll set up the couch
 as a bed.


  Can I put Homer's pillows
 under my butt?
  Of course.


  You don't need pillows
 under your butt.


  Your butt is pillows, genius.


  The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show.

 
  And now, Itchy
 and Scratchy
  perform their
 cutting-edge version
  of the "Sabre Dance.

"
  Mom, can I have
 a jelly bean sandwich for lunch?
  Mm, how about
 a fruit salad?
  Fruit?
  What's the matter?
  That's what they
 served at camp.


  Fine.

 Fine, jelly beans.


  Marge, voulez vous rendezvous
  at the dog's bed?
  I can't move.


 His head's on my arm.


  Can you give me a foot rub?
  Also, we both have
 to sign this permission slip.


  Uh, maybe we should
 just go to sleep.


  Oof! Can't sleep, can't snuggle.


  Gonna do the unthinkable.


  Homie, what do you mean?
  Gonna go to work early.


  Geez, there's a lot of spaces
 when you get in early.


  Geez, there's a lot of
 donuts when you get in early.


  Hot coffee?
  Whoever heard of such a thing?
  Hmm.


  I was supposed to read this
 when I started the job,
  but I didn't want
 the other workers
  to think of me as a nerd.


  What's he doing?
  He's reading.


 Nerd.


  Hey, Homer,
 settle a bet.


  Red beans and rice
 or red beans on rice?
  Winner gets 3,000 bucks.


  Sorry, guys,
 maybe another time.


  Homer Simpson don't
 want to screw around.


  That's like Aquaman
 moving to Phoenix.


  You know, Lenny, seeing
 Homer acting responsible
  Oh, Aquaman to Phoenix,
 I just got that
  Uh, makes me want
 to buckle down and do my job.


  You know, vice president
 of marketing.


  Hey, if you need me,
 I'll be cold-calling people
  to see what they think
 of electricity.


  Uh, Mr.

 Smithers,
 I, uh, I noticed
  the plant's free subscription
 to Nuclear Safety magazine
  was hitting the
 six-month mark.


  They're gonna start charging
 us the full newsstand price.


  And no one pays
 those prices.


  Nice catch, Simpson.


  So I had the idea
 to cancel it
  and sign up for another free
 trial under a new e-mail.


  Wow.

 Wow!
  Simpson, something is
 very different about you.


  I am
 sexually frustrated.


  Tell me about it.


  Kamp Krusty! Kamp Krusty!
  Homie, listen.


  No ketchup!
 No ketchup!
  Oh, no, not the
 hamburger dream.


  Oh, my God,
 I really am traumatized.


  I need help.


  Lis! Lis!
  Can it wait till morning?
  Sure.


  Lis! Lis!
  Thanks for waiting
 till morning.


  No problemo.


  I had an actual nightmare
 about Kamp Krusty.


  There was a body
 in a red life vest!
  What else
 do you remember?
  We were canoeing.


 We were in a storm.


  It's coming back
 to me, too!
  Whatever happened
 must have been so horrible
  we repressed the memory.


  But don't tell, because
 they'll make me miss school.


  Maybe you should
 miss school.


  I have perfect attendance.


  You can't get that back!
  Okay, I'll bring your
 carriage around.


  Uh-oh, looks like snow.


  Very funny, Bart.


  Stop it!
  Made you breakfast.


  I also made reservations
 for Mother's Day.


  I know it's three months away,
 but you can't book too early.


  Wow!
  Who's that guy?
  I don't know.


  Hmm.


  D'oh!
  Mr.

 Burns, I noticed no one ever
 puts suggestions in the box.


  So I took the liberty
 of making my own.


  Hmm.


  Yeah.


  Excellent.

 Simpson,
 I'm giving you a raise.


  More money?
  But that's more
 than I make now!
  You've done
 so well, Simpson.


  I'm giving you
 your own trap door button.


  Oh, thank you!
  Excuse me.

 Coming through.


 Working out issues.


  Boom-shakalaka.


  I was at Kamp Krusty, too.


  You don't see me freaking out
 every time I see
  Red vest! Red vest!
  What does it mean?
 What does it mean?
  It means, young lady,
  that you're about to go
 to the head of the line.


  Whoa, whoa, whoa.

 If everyone
 has a cut-the-line pass,
  no one has a cut-the-line pass.


  Quit your whining!
 I'm riding the ride!
  While you were pouting,
 I did it again!
  Oh.

 Maggie's asleep,
  and the kids are still having
 fun at the park with Grampa.


  We're alone.


  Marge, no!
  I've pledged my abstinence,
  like all the most successful
 rock stars.


  Come on, mister.


  I'm too tired to
 get my groove back.


  It's all on you!
  No means no.

 I looked it up
 in the dictionary.


  No?! No?!
  You've never said "no.

"
  Hmm? Hmm.


  Hmm.


  Oh!
  Honey, I'm really sorry,
 but I'm here for you every way.


  Except physically.


  Also, spiritually
 and emotionally.


  And I've never been good
 at zipping up dresses.


  What are you saying?
  Men have accomplished
 unbelievable things
  when they've denied
 themselves whoopee.


  The pointy pyramids of Egypt,
  the Duomo, which I now know
 is a thing.


  You don't name
 a company "Microsoft"
  when you're getting some.


  Oh, boy.


  First the kids are screwed up,
 and now our marriage is?
  We need therapy.


  I said "therapy,"
 not "theremin.

"
  Honest mistake.


  Or was it?
  Welcome, Marge.


  Homer, no need
 to take your pants off.


  It's not what you think.


 I just had a big lunch.


  Just a series of questions
 for now.


  Then the pants
 come off.


  Now, let me be blunt.


  Are you happy with
 your romantic life?
  My problem used to be
 too much satisfaction.


  We hear that a lot.


  But I'm afraid
 not so much lately.


  Do you self-gratify?
  Yes.

 I do everything
 but masturbate.


  You know, this all started
 with our poor kids traumatized
  by a budget
 summer camp.


  So many perfect marriages
 ruined by kids.


  We tell them it's
 not their fault,
  when, of course, it's
 always their fault.


  What you must do is return
 your children to this camp
  and face down their demons.


  Wait, wait, wait, wait!
  There's so much more you can do
 when you don't think about sex.


  That's why nuns
 are so successful.


  You have to take the kids
 back to that camp.


  Well, it beats
 hanging out with them.


  Now, if you'll excuse us,
 we have some deviants coming in.


  Hello? Anybody here?
  Yeah, I brought my lady.


  She used to be
 the helicopter ride
  in front of the supermarket.


  Oh, uh, just finished.


  All right, deviant out.


  My kids are a mess.


  Homer's turned into the man
 I've always wanted,
  which I don't really want.


  And for some reason, we're
 going back to Kamp Krusty.


  Aw!
  What happened
 to this place?
  People are wearing
 terrycloth bathrobes
  like they're ancient Romans.


  Actually, more
 like Macedonians.


  All right, come on,
 deer and pig.


  It's time for you to mate
 and then fight to the death.


  What happened
 to this place?
  Oh, uh, Krusty
 cut his losses
  by partnering with Caligula's
 World Family Entertainment.


  They redid the whole place
 as an adult spa.


  Uh-oh.

 Did I leave
 my sash on?
  Why don't you kids go in here,
 and we'll find someone
  who can prove to you
 that what you think happened
  didn't happen.


  So, what do we do now,
 get naked?
  Ha-ha! I'm joking.


 Unless you want to.


  In which case,
 I've never been more serious.


  So, um, uh,
 which is it?
  Don't want to.


  Ah, good thing I was joking.


  Who stole the cookie
 from the cookie jar? 
  Tyler stole the cookie from
 the cookie jar 
  What, me? 
  Yeah, you 
  Couldn't be 
  Then who? 
  Courtney stole the cookie
 from the cookie jar 
  I've heard enough.


 Let's go, Courtney.


  You, too, Tyler.


  Hey, Bart, Bart, now's our
 chance to break out of here.


  But I'm four loops away
 from finishing my potholder.


  Now!
  Ugh!
  Marge, you know, it used
 to be I'd be tempted
  by every one
 of these places.


  Now I just want to know
 where the business center is.


  It's over there.


  You can print up all the free
 boarding passes you want.


  Oh!
  We didn't even fly here.


  Oh.

 Oh.


  Bart, I've seen
 that shed before!
  Hey, I know your
 life is boring,
  but you don't have
 to advertise it.


  I'm remembering now.


  We were trying
 to escape by canoe.


  Come back! Everyone needs
 to watch the musical!
  We've rehearsed
 for three hours!
  But there was
 another kid with us.


  You're right!
  His name was Charlie.


  I forgot
  because I was high
 on poster paint fumes.


  Quiet!
 We tipped over in the rapids.


  Oh, my God!
 Charlie didn't come back up!
  Hey, hey!
 Look who's back!
  Kamp Krusty alumni!
  We have reason to believe that
 someone was killed in this camp!
  Whoa! What happened to hello?
  Hard to concentrate with waves
 gently lapping on the shore.


  Ooh! Marge, are you sure
 you want to do this?
  Mm, I think I still
 want the old you.


  Everyone, down below the belt!
 Move, move, move!
  Don't leave anything up here!
 We will not be back!
  Play something to
 put him in the mood!
  Faster!
  These children
 would like to report
  a traumatic incident
 on the property.


  Poor Charlie.


  Charlie?
 Did he have a red vest?
  Yes!
 Yes!
  Can you kids
 keep a secret?
  I can, but Lisa can't.


  I told you that
 in confidence!
  Charlie! You're alive!
  And a man, I might add
 A very short man.


  They like to be called
 "little people.

"
  Eh, not that much.


  I was working undercover as
 a spy for Departures magazine.


  They are everywhere.


  Anyway, when the canoe flipped,
 I made my getaway.


  But you didn't have
 your life vest.


  I'm a grown-up! I can swim!
  And vote!
  Oh, my God!
  It's a miracle.


  Whoa, I guess I really
 was traumatized.


  And now I'm glad
 everything's all right.


  So many stars.


  Ever wonder how many worlds
 are out there, Homie?
  Pizza.

 Want pizza.


  And you.


  That's my man.


  For the fifth time today,
 I am not a diving platform!
  Next on Fox
  Oh, baby, baby.


  Tonight's the night
 we're not gonna get it on.


  And when I say never,
 I mean forever.


  At my insistence,
 I will keep you at a distance.


  Because
  My darling, you 
  Have had enough
 of my love, babe 
  Mm, baby, don't get upset 
  But your needs
 will not be met 
  Mm, it's like the more
 you want, the less I give 
  Baby, that's no lie.

 
  Oh, yeah.


     


                





                    			1
  Haw-haw!
  D'oh!
  It was the biggest scandal
  in the history of Springfield sports.


  Never has someone fallen from
 such heights to such lows,
  except maybe for that
 tightrope walker who sneezed.


  That was terrible.


  This situation is a disgusting mockery
  of a repulsive joke that would
 make me sick to my stomach
  if there was there was
  one good restaurant in this town,
  which there is not!
  There is nothing to vomit.


  And all because
 of one young man.


  Okay, so I shaved points in basketball.


  Just don't make a big production of it.


  This is 22 for 30.


  My son is a handful.


  Can you say that on TV?
  No one ever thought he'd work
 for gamblers with the mob.


  I always thought he'd work
 for gamblers with the mob.


  In the morning, we saw the horrors
  of the beaches at Iwo Jima.


  This is a sports documentary.


  I'm getting there!
  In my unit, they called
 me "Quarterback.

"
  Because when I borrowed a
 quarter, I never gave it back.


  At the end of the war, I had
 a buck 75, and no friends.


  I remember
 it like it was yesterday.


  Or maybe the day before that.


  It all started with a prank.


  Bart had no idea where it would lead.


  This voice is scaring me.


  I need Puppy Goo-Goo!
  Safety kiss!
  I think I'll be okay.


  I love you.


  Yeah, so here was the
 quote, unquote "prank.

"
  Bart sent out a memo telling
 everyone to wear white
  for some nonsense called
 Polar Bear Remembrance Day.


  Yes.


  Then the little dickens sent Skin-ner
  a different memo telling him to wear
  a floral shirt in honor of
 King Kamehameha's birthday.


  Had it ended there, fine.


  Pleasant conclusion to a busy week.


  But it didn't end there.


  Now don't worry,
  all the bees want are flowers.


  Willie, kill the bees!
  Not till I hear their side of it.


  Bart received the
 longest detention in history.


  Bored, he began to shoot baskets,
  a talent that would irrevocably
 make his life better.


  Then worse, then better, then the same.


  Wish I had a rabbit
 in a hat with a bat 
  And a '64 Impala 
  I wish I was, like, six-foot-nine 
  So I can get with Leoshi,
 'cause she don't know me 
  But, yo, she's really fine 
  You know I see her all the time 
  Everywhere I go, and
 even in my dreams 
  I can scheme up ways
 to make her mine 
  'Cause I know she's livin' phat 
  Her boyfriend's tall
 and he plays ball 
  So how am I gonna compete with that? 
  A troubled young man who
 was good at basketball.


  I'd never heard of such a thing.


  Of course, his detention was commuted,
  and he was made a starter on the team.


  That's my son! My son!
  Which is, of course,
 another version of me!
  Him! Me! Us! Me!
  Everywhere Bart went,
 he was given star treatment.


  At school
  at the public pool
  It's really not that dangerous.


  with local merchants.


  Oh, young basketball star,
  I have something special for you.


  The new 7,200-ounce Squishy.


  But not everyone was
 celebrating the Bart-mitzvah.


  write an article
  on the school's new hero, Bart Simpson.


  This is worse than
  when we were square-dance
 partners in gym.


  Grab your partner nice and slow 
  Allemande left and 
  Do-si-doh.

 
  That's the last time I had work 
  Now I'm just a homeless jerk 
  Allemande left and
 prance to the right 
  I need a place to spend the night.

 
  Springfield had never won
  a championship in any sport.


  The only banner on the gym wall
  was one that came with the building.


  But now, there was a shot.


  I was so proud of Bart,
 I did anything I could
  to help him practice.


  Mm!
  But then it happened.


  Fame went to Bart's head.


  Just once, I'd like to see
 science go to his head.


  He's got more D's than Dolly Parton!
  I'm not sure what that means,
 but please use the joke.


  I paid someone 25 bucks for it.


  Bart Simpson, can ya
 please join the team?
  Man, I am the team.


  Aw, that tears it!
  I'm not coaching anymore!
  I'm going back to what I love doing:
  drowning gophers.


  Ah! What was that for?!
  Our new coach will be parent-volunteer
  and Bart owner, Homer Simpson.


  Do you know anything about basketball?
  Why the change?
  What is your basketball philosophy?
  Shower at home so no one
 makes fun of your weenie.


  I learned that from the
 late great Red Auerbach.


  No more questions!
  D'oh!
  What the hell is that
 thing doing in a gym?!
  Your new coach, everybody!
  Bart got a coach who would kiss his butt
  like one cheek was Kobe
 and the other Kareem.


  Well, there is no "I" in "team.

"
  There's no "U" in "effort.

"
  There's no "X" in "dog"!
  What do Oscar the
 Grouch's feet look like?
  Nobody knows!
  I have a TV for Bart Simpson.


  Just put it with the others.


  I'm worried he's getting
 a little spoiled.


  Oh, that's ridiculous.


  Excuse me, sir.


  Bart says no unauthorized photography.


  Don't look directly at him!
  As Bart's showboating veered
  ever closer to globetrotting,
  the disrespect grew.


  Can you clean that for me, Coach?
  And that, and that, and those,
  and that, and that.


  What are you looking at?
  What the?!
  But after one
 showboat shot too many,
  Homer Simpson had something
 he'd never had before: enough.


  Uh, son, some of the other
 parents are complaining.


  Apparently, they're
 attached to their children,
  and they want to see
 them touch the ball.


  They can touch it in the team photo.


  I'm going to draw up a play.


  One where you pass.


  Why don't you pass a physical,
 you boozy bag of goo.


  Marge is right.

 You're getting spoiled!
  Before you strangle me, maybe you
 should check the scoreboard.


  I'm your dad and your coach.


  And because no one else
 would, your godfather.


  So hit the bench!
  When we return,
 the interesting part.


  From now on, you're going
 to be a team player.


  No more important than anyone.


  Except Milhouse.


  I'm on the team 'cause it's my ball.


  Certain people
 had begun to notice
  Bart's unhappiness.


  People with criminal backgrounds.


  They had more records than Dolly Parton.


  Man, that is a joke
 that keeps on giving.


  This is gonna break my heart, but
  Yeah, the kid was ripe for
 criminal exploitation.


  And in this town, the
 other cops are pathetic.


  Fat, lazy.

 You want to find one?
  Just follow the sound of a
 milkshake being sucked.


  There's no belt that fits me.


  I'm wearing police tape around my waist.


  I saw the kid was upset,
 so I took him for cannoli.


  That's not a crime.


  You don't
 know what a crime is.


  Not that I'd know what a crime is.


  What's with all the psst-psst-psst?
  Have you sprung a leak,
 or do you want to?
  I don't think
 that's advisable to say that.


  I've been told I was just kidding.


  Fat Tony, enjoy this-a
 cannoli on-a the house.


  It's like eating the
 bone-a marrow of an angel.


  Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!
  They talked about
 life and basketball,
  a game Fat Tony had always loved.


  Basketball is just like life.


  It's filled with a court,
 shooting and guards.


  Basketball is nothing like life.


  Fat Tony saw an
 opening, and he took it.


          And at his next game,
  Bart did a very odd thing.


  And with Springfield
 up by a meager one point,
  star guard Bart Simpson
  is just dribbling, he's not shooting,
  with two minutes to go.


  I don't know how, but
 Homer gained 12 pounds
  chewing towels.


  I put jelly on 'em.


  Time expired!
  Bart didn't know it, but
 he was point shaving.


  That's when a player wins the game,
  but makes sure his team
 doesn't cover the spread.


  The team's happy, the gamblers
 are happy, everybody wins.


  The only unhappy person
 is someone like me,
  who has to explain the thing.


  Well, at least you'll let
 me play my saxophone.


  Good thing you cut that song.


  Did you know I once took a train
 halfway across Cleveland?
  This is not a video trick.


  He really just stopped moving,
  but Bart had just gotten started.


  You could be an accessory
 to a crime, you know.


  Are you letting your anger at Dad
  make you into a patsy for the mob?
  Hey, Bart Simpson is nobody's patsy.


  Hey, Bart, Fat Tony says to
 win by less than six points.


  Here's a list of acceptable
 point differentials.


  It could be five, four, three
  You realize you're
 having this conversation
  in front of a reporter.


  Hey, I don't see no reporter.


  I see a little girl with
 futile dreams of fitting in.


  Gee whiz, you don't have to be so mean.


  That's the business I'm in! Whoa! Hey!
  Shoot! Shoot! Just like I drew it up!
  Okay, here's a shot:
  you're not bald, your hair
 left out of embarrassment.


  Why, you little!
  I'll teach you to win the game!
  You stupid buzzer-beating,
 clutch-shooting
  Oh, come on, man.


  - ice water in your veins
 - I'm taking my talents to Shelbyville.


  here comes the post-game interview!
  - You have to give them credit
 - This is the first thing you've done as a coach.


  they played hard!
  - People are gonna hear about this, Dad.


 - I'm so proud of these boys,
  - and especially our sixth man
 - You're still nicer than Bobby Knight.


  the fans!
  All right, let me hear your side.


  Sorry, my side is
 exclusive to my charity,
  The American Fart Association.


  Why, you little!
  Checkmate.


  D'oh!
  But the boy who could
 spin a ball with his doodle
  was about to learn a very tough lesson.


        Fat Tony denied
 he'd made any money,
  but this FBI footage suggests otherwise.


  I thought I was just
 keeping the score down
  to get back at my Dad,
  but Fat Tony was betting
 against us, every game.


  I was a patsy.


  Ow! She didn't mean that.


  D'oh! Ow! Ow!
  I was scared, Milhouse scared.


  Why do you keep cutting to me?
  And then it got worse.


  Fat Tony told me to lose the finals.


  Not win by a little, but lose or else.


  "Or else"?
  My client does not speak like that.


  Yeah, now drop the subject, or else.


  Edit that out, or else.


  I-I'm gonna stop talking or else.


  Damn it.


  What did Fat Tony say to Bart?
  His capo, Johnny Tightlips,
 refused to talk.


  Anyone here own a black
 Lincoln Continental,
  license plate, "Zero to Say"?
  It's being towed.


  Sir, you're the only one here.


  I saw you get out of it.


  Yeah, maybe it is.

 Maybe I am.


  Maybe you did.

 Or maybe it's not.


  And I'm not, and you didn't.


  But you didn't hear this,
 that, or the other thing.


  Or maybe you did.


  Hey! My granny's in there!
  Shaving points was one thing,
 but he wanted me to lose.


  I let down my team.

 I let down my town.


  So, I guess this is where
 I break down and cry.


  Hey, I'm the one who's supposed to cry.


  No.

 This is my story.


  Tighten on me.


  Tighten on me.


  Fine.

 Tighten on him
 then rack focus to me.


  Dad, this is supposed to be
 about us getting together.


  Fine.

 Tighten on him.

 Rack focus to me.


  Cut to a wide shot.


  Split screen with Marge.


  Truck in, nice and slow.


  Then cut to a "B" roll of me
 eating a tuna fish sandwich.


  Dad, how did you learn these things?
  Son, show business is
 everybody's business.


  Dutch angle, photo negative and freeze!
  I'm a excommation point!
  In the gym that night, you could
 cut the tension with a knife,
  but, uh, we don't allow
 knives in school,
  not even in metaphors.


  We got to fight the powers that be 
  Fight the power 
  Fight the power.

 
  Another
 bucket by Bart Simpson!
  His sloppy play is a distant memory,
  like Nelson's father.


  Yeah, interesting side note:
  Nelson left a ticket for his
 father in case he showed up.


  And he did show up, but
 then he sold the ticket
  without seeing Nelson, and
 he skipped town again.


  You believe that?
  Rejected!
  Like I've been rejected.


  Nothing but net!
  Which is what my mom
 wears in the strip club.


  It was in the third quarter
 when the game really got weird,
  and I got a low bar for weird.


  Bart went to shoot, and took a hard foul
  from his own best friend.


  Let's just say Bart wasn't the
 only one Fat Tony had gotten to.


  This was my bobblehead.


  They got to him, in my
 bedroom, where he bobbled.


  Hey, let's just say that bobblehead
  won't be attending no
 more giveaway days.


  You keep shooting your mouth,
  you'll wind up in that building
 going up on Third Street.


  It's a Third Street address, but
 actually you enter on Lincoln.


  Yet another secret revealed!
  I'm sorry, Dad.

 I was a jerk.


  The good thing about being a kid
  is you get to make mistakes so
 you don't make them as an adult.


  Thanks, Dad.


  But don't you still make mistakes?
  The best one was you, son.

 Aw.


  Now go win that game!
  And win he did.


  He blew our net budget
 for the next ten years.


  But not everyone was cheering.


  Is he going for a gun?
  Oh.


  Get me a gun.


  We thought we were goners.


  Our lives flashed before our eyes.


  I had a lot of crazy jobs.


  And then the cavalry came
 on her stupid high horse.


  Let them go.


  Really? And what do you have on me?
  The goods.


  The goods? Oh, that sounds bad.


  Fat Tony, may I speak to you in Italian?
  I don't know Italian.


  How about Sicilian?
  That's a language?
  How about I say it like Porky Pig?
  E-ba-dee, e-ba-dee, e-ba-dee,
 e-ba-dee, e-ba-dee
  Say what you got to say.


  Turns out I'm the hero
 of this documentary.


  I think that deserves a chyron.


  It happens that Fat Tony had a secret,
  a secret I had uncovered with
 a little bit of research.


  I wondered, if Fat Tony
 liked basketball so much,
  why didn't he play?
  Turns out he had.


  For a girls' team.


  And if there's one thing a
 Mafia boss doesn't want known,
  it's that he was the
 third-string shooting guard
  on the Springfield Little Debbies.


  You keep quiet about what you know.


  All of you keep quiet!
  Keep quiet about what, boss?
  The man Spanx you wear?
  Your high school
 nickname, Robert DeZero?
  The way you cried at Toy Story 2?
  That's not even the sad one.


  What? What?
  Why do you keep talking?
  I'm sorry.

 It's a nervous condition.


  Can you give me the name of
 that secret shrink you see?
  So, we made a deal.


  I'd forget if Fat Tony forgave.


  But now the secret's out.


  It's in a documentary.


  No one watches those,
 unless it's a documentary
  where a rich guy kills people
 and no one knows about it.


  As far as you know.


  I'm guilty, guilty, guilty.


  Sir, you know you're on mic.


  Who is this Mike
 you're speaking of?
  We'll kill him, too!
  But all sports
 stories have an upside,
  unless you're a Detroit Lions fan.


  So this young man, showboat
 and friend of the mob,
  gets off with not even
 a slap on the wrist.


  It's a travesty wrapped in outrage,
  marinated in a sauce of
 everything's gone to hell!
  I admit, it was fun.


  For a short time, we had
 our own little superstar.


  And he kept playing.


  Then he ran up against one tall kid,
  and found out he really
 wasn't that good.


  But Lisa, Lisa had a real
 talent for journalism.


  Whatever that gets us.


  Homer, we have to end
 on something sweet.


  Whatever that gets us.


  -  Now basketball is my favorite sport 
 -  Uh-huh 
  I like the way they dribble
 up and down the court 
  I keep it so fresh on the microphone 
  -  I like no interruption when the game is on 
 -  Game's on 
  -  I like slam dunks that take me to the hoop 
 -  Yeah 
  My favorite play is 
  Sorry, y'all.


  I like the pick-and-roll,
 I like the give-and-go 
  And it's basketball,
 Bow Wow, let's go 
  Yeah.

 Nothing but nerd.


  All around the world 
  -  We love that basketball 
 -  Yeah 
  No, I didn't!
  Basketball 
  I admit it, I was a total boob.


  Oh! Why do I keep going there?
  -  Let's go 
 -  They're playing basketball 
  All around the world 
  We love that basketball 
  And Nelson's dad came back.


  And I should know.


  He's me.


  Haw-haw!
  Papa!
  So, you're making narrator money.


  That's right, and I
 brought Nelson a gift.


  Sleeves for my vest!
  Son, you look just
 like a parole officer.


  And so we were a family again,
  just long enough to take this picture.

  D'oh!

  George, I'm sorry to see you up here.


  Well, yes, but I died
 for a worthy cause.


  As we speak, my body is
 about to be dissected
  by a budding young scientist.


  Let's observe the dedication to learning
  of this ten-year-old scholar
 by the name of Bart Simpson.


  Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab, die 
  Stab, stab, die, die, death, kill.

 
  Well, his passion is undeniable.


  Yes, very very impressive.


  By examining my specimen's
 pyloric sphincter valve,
  I deduced that she had an
 affinity for fruit flies.


  By examining my specimen's natty dreads,
  I was able to deduce that he
 was a jammin' Rasta-frogian.


  My body, my little green body.


  Okay, but surely his portrayal
  of Rastafarianism will
 be culturally sensitive.


  Pass the Dutchie.


  We be smokin' slabba
 slabba with the Babylon.


  Ribbit, ribbit, mon.


  (panting loudly)
  Come now, George.


  At least this Scottish groundskeeper
  will give your remains
 a respectful burial.


  WILLIE: Into the crapper you
 go, useless froggy garbage.


  (toilet flushing)
  Are you going to put a
 good spin on that, too?
  Hmm? Are you?!
  Well, are you?
  Well, uh ribbit?
  MARGE: I can't put these
 grades on the refrigerator.


  I can't even put them on
 the garage refrigerator.


  It's not my fault.


  - I blame "so-key-ity.

"
 - What?!
  You know, so-key-ity.


  That's what everyone
 blames for everything.


  You mean "society"?
  - Yeah, that's the guy.


 - Honey,
  I know you're a bright boy,
  but if you don't try harder in school,
  you could end up
  not a success.


  Oh, that.

 Don't worry, Mom.


  As long as I can stand on a corner
  and spin a sign reading "new condos,"
  I'll be just fine.


  (groaning)
  (Marge groaning)
  (Marge groaning)
  All that pacing isn't gonna fix the boy.


  Just get him some pills.


  Two pinks and a blue, and
 it's off to the races.


  Everything we've tried
 with Bart has failed.


  What if there's nothing we can do?
  Mm, "nothing we can do"
 is a whole lot better
  than "it'll take all we've got.

"
  I wonder if anyone talks
 about parenting online.


  Look at this one!
  HOMER: They're skiing.


  Skiing means happy.


  Hmm, an expert with a
 new book to promote.


  Oh, I wonder if she'd be willing
 to speak to a group for a fee.


  Getting your child established
  on the path to success isn't easy.


  I was driving my daughter
 from her falconry tournament
  to lute class when she
 turned to me asked
  (speaks Mandarin)
  which is Mandarin
 for, "How do you do it?"
  She and I are learning Mandarin.


  The answer? (speaks Mandarin)
  Positive reinforcement.


  (inquisitive chatter)
  In a recent study, this
 mouse was denied food
  whenever he failed to find
 his way through a maze.


  The mouse ended up dying
 of low self-esteem.


  (shocked and excited chatter)
  I had a nightmare where
 that happened to Bart,
  but I never told you about it.


  I love it when you don't tell me things.


  This mouse was given food
  whether he got through the maze or not.


  And this fall, he'll be
 in a lab at Harvard.


  (excited gasps and chatter)
  Low self-esteem can cripple your
 child's chances of success.


  The cure: praise.


  (excited chatter)
  Praise they can hold in their hands.


  Certificates, ribbons
 and, yes, even trophies.


  (crowd gasps)
  (gasps) Trophies.


  So that's the easy answer.


  If Ralphie's shelf says he's a winner,
  then he'll be one!
  And Moe yells a third thing
 to feel part of the group!
  Yes! Trophies-- that's what Bart needs.


  This is how we save him.


  (scoffs) Give Bart a trophy? What for?
  Most boogers wiped on a bedroom wall?
  They're giving trophies for that now?
  I weep for this country.


  Bart's future is at stake.


  Besides, I'm tired of
 Springfield missing out
  on every parenting trend, like
 the time-out and the diaper.


  I never got a trophy when I was a kid,
  and I turned out just
  (gulping)
  (slowly): fine.


  He's my son, and he's getting
 a trophy for nothing.


  You hear me? For nothing!
  Huh.

 Huh?
  (screams)
  Good morning.


  How's my special little winner?
  How'd you get that thing in
 my bed without waking me up?
  Because you're a champion sleeper.


  It's the craziest thing.


  She will not give up on that kid.


  Trophies can boost self-esteem.


  If you actually win them, like I did.


  But what's the point
  of just handing out unearned statues?
  And statuettes.


  Well, it's just a waste of
 gullible parents' money.


  (echoing): Waste of
 gullible parents' money.


  Gullible parents' money.


  Money.

 Money.


  (bell dings) Hmm.


  Step right up! Every kid's a winner!
  The more you spend, the more you love!
  Mm-hmm.


  I thought you agreed that
 trophies should be earned.


  I'm earning nature's trophy: money.


  (wind whistles softly)
  Remember, folks.


  Nothing but a genuine
 Trophyland trophy says
  to your kids that
  HOMER:  You're the best around 
  Nothing's gonna ever keep you down 
  You're the best around 
  Nothing's gonna ever keep you down 
  You're the best around 
  Nothing's gonna ever keep you down 
  You're the best around 
  Nothing's gonna 
  Ever keep you down 
  You're the best around 
  Nothing's gonna ever keep you down 
  You're the best.

 
  (chuckles) These stupid, loving
 parents will buy trophies
  for any accomplishment.


  Not wetting the bed,
 using your inside voice,
  even "go watch TV in the other room.

"
  I still think these things are
 good for their self-esteem.


  Not to mention the self-esteem
  that comes from wad riffling.


  (wind whistles softly)
  Look, I even put the boy to work.


  Well, then he should
 get a trophy for that.


  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
  We have a saying in the
 participation trophy business.


  "Don't get high-- self-esteem--
  on your own supply-- of self-esteem.

"
  I don't care.

 I'm giving him this.


  What? Why did it break?
  The parts are of the highest quality.


  They come from the
 China of China: India.


  Boy, did you glue this trophy
 together with bubblegum?
  Eh, sticky is sticky.


 I'm taking my break.


  HOMER: See? Giving him
 trophies did nothing.


  You've showered him with praise,
  and he's just as lazy as ever.


  Shh! What if he heard you say that?
  Hey, if Bart is as bad at eavesdropping
  as he is at everything else,
  we've got nothing to worry about.


  I say we keep talking loudly.


  But what about his confidence?
  Face it.

 Our son is a screw-up.


  He was born a screw-up, and
 no matter how hard he tries--
  which he never will--
  Bart will always be a screw-up.


  (groans)
  And have you ever heard that
 sound he makes when he's sad?
  Pathetic.


  (sighs)
  Queen's bishop Lomotil
 takes king's Ativan.


  Oh, looks like I'll be
 having a panic attack
  on the toilet tonight.


  (scoffs) Look at that
 whimpering little crybaby.


  (mocking): Wah! Wah!
  Abe, that's your grandson.


  Come visit me!
  I'm so lonely!
  (crying): Wah! Wah!
  What's got you down, kiddo?
  My dad says I'm terrible at everything.


  Oh, he's just repeating what
 he heard as a boy from me.


  Oh, I was an awful father,
 just like my old man.


  Your dad didn't believe in you, either?
  It wasn't his fault.


  He was just focused on his career
  as a professional child-beater.


  Men would come from five towns over
  to study my father's technique.


  But no matter how many
 strangles he patented,
  his father never approved.


  (choking loudly)
  Even if only a little bit
 of that really happened,
  I'll never escape being a loser.


  That's loser talk!
  You're a great kid, and I'm
 gonna prove it to you.


  Boy, this here's a real trophy.


  Our family's most prized possession:
  a Baumont Chrono-master Elite.


  It's been a Simpson heirloom
  ever since it was stolen off
 a dead body at Gettysburg.


  In 1982.


  Whoa!
  Wait.

 Is this just
 another gold shiny thing
  to trick me into feeling
 special when I'm not?
  You are special!
  You're like my prostate--
  a spiky little troublemaker
 who plays by his own rules.


  You don't take hooey from Louis.


  Never have, never will.


  (shudders)
  I feel something.


  It's like a sunburn on the inside.


  It's called "pride.

"
  Every tick will remind you
  you've got a grandpa
 who believes in you.


  The same way I believe
  the retirement home has
 been taken over by robots.


  (Eastern European accent):
 I am not a robot.


  I just have light-up sneakers.


    (Ralph humming)
  Why is my trophy the smallest?
  You all lost-- to me!
  (confused murmurs)
  Lisa, are you suggesting we
 engage in excellence bias?
  (crying): She's loser-shaming me.


  (growls)
  (students gasp)
  Why do you always have to
 make trouble, ya wee harpy?
  How am I supposed to stay silent
  when parents are just blindly
 chasing the latest trend?
  Ugh, parents.


  Those lazy lunch-packers.


  They just want to be told what to do.


  And there's no shortage of
 experts who want to tell 'em.


  WILLIE (echoing): No
 shortage of experts.


  Experts.

 Experts.

 Experts.


  (bell dings)
  LISA; Another parenting expert, eh?
  Clearly, this is a community in the grip
  of an addiction to trophies.


  Now, parents,
  I warn you, too much praise
 creates millennials--
  a generation of soft,
 entitled narcissists,
  who drop out of college
 to become deejays.


  That only pays well at
 the very highest levels.


  Instead of showering
 your kids with gifts,
  you should prod them to
 greatness with GRIT.


  Get up.

 Retry.


  I don't care if you're
  Tired.


  He's got a word made of other words.


  (chuckles) He must know
 what he's talking about.


  Oh, it is an end to praise.


  Praise Vishnu.


  (crowd exclaims, murmurs)
  Remember, GRIT also stands for:
  Get Rid of Idiotic Trophies.


  Another word word! He did it again!
  Why does the word "of"
 sometimes count in the acronym
  and sometimes not?
  Shut up, Mel! Your kids live
 in Nebraska with your mom.


  CROWD (chanting): No more trophies!
 No more trophies!
  Uh-oh.


  You are scum, sir!
  - (crowd booing)
 - Burn in hell!
  Kill him with GRIT!
  Hi, Homer.

 How's the trophy business?
  Nobody wants them
 anymore, thanks to GRIT.


  Stupid parenting method I
 can't exploit for money.


  Actually kinda makes sense.


  Hate it so much.


  (Homer gasps)
  I know that.


  That's my dad's old pocket watch.


  How did you get it?
  Oh, Grampa said I earned it.


  I guess someone in this
 family's proud of me.


  Oh, you didn't want it, did you?
  (scoffs) Yeah, right.


  That watch means nothing to me.


  Really? Then how do you
 explain that case you made?
  I built it to always remind
 me of what not to want.


  What about your self-published novel?
  Well, the character of John Homer
  is only partly based on me.


  Well, if I didn't know better,
 I'd say you were obsessed
  with getting Grampa's watch.


  Ooh, thanks for the analysis, Dr.

 Freud.


  Next you'll be telling me that
 this whole trophy business,
  and in fact, all my
 get-rich-quick schemes
  over the years, are born of a
 desperate need for approval
  from a father who couldn't show love.


  Likely because of his
 traumatic relationship
  with his own father, and
 his before him, and so on.


  But, unfortunately, Dr.

 Freud,
  that couldn't be further
 from the truth, Doctor.


  If you say so.


  Now I'm gonna take this out
 and see what life is like
  with real love and encouragement
 ticking in my pocket.


  Stupid watch.


  Doesn't even have a fob.


  Bart, where's the fob?
  Bart, you look like a fool!
  (groaning slowly)
  You're the best around 
  Nothing's gonna ever keep you down 
  You're the best around 
  Nothing's gonna ever keep you down 
  You're the best around 
  Nothing's gonna ever keep you down 
  Down 
  Fight till the end 'cause
 your life will depend 
  On the strength that
 you have inside you 
  Ah, got to be proud, staring 
  No!
  HOMER:  You're the worst around 
  Everything's gonna bring you down.

 
  Okay, Milhouse, I'll drop a
 rock, you watch it come down.


  That should be where
 Grampa's watch landed.


  - (thud)
 - MILHOUSE: Ow!
  Did you see where the rock landed?
  In my eye!
  Oh.

 That watch was the only thing
 that made me not terrible.


  I can't lose it.


  I'll drop another rock a
 few feet to the left.


  My other eye!
  Ow!
  Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
  Not a single one has missed me!
  What are you doing?
  That expert at the school said
 trophies are bad for kids.


  It's all part of GRIT.


  No, no.


  My trophies were earned.


  Even the soccer one?
  I went to most of the practices.


  Yeah, but what happens when
 another parenting expert
  comes along with a whole
 new theory on self-esteem?
  Another expert?
  Who are they? What are they saying?
  Aw.


  Okay, the watch is gone.


  I guess I can live with being
 a useless, worthless nothing
  as long as no one finds out.


  Sweetie, your grampa's on the phone.


  Hello.


  Great news, kiddo.


  Remember That magazine is putting out
  their annual family heirlooms issue.


  They want us for the cover.


  You, me and the pocket watch.


  Um
  It's a great story.


  Passing a beloved heirloom
 from grandfather to grandson.


  A gift that restored a
 child's faith in himself.


  Uh, Grampa, there's something
 I have to tell you.


  Hold on one second.


  I'm just finishing up
  a mandatory pre-article heart exam.


  Doc says as long as I don't suffer
  any major disappointments, I'll be fine.


  Now, what did you want to tell me?
  Uh, helmets ruined football.


  Exactly! If you want
 to protect your head,
  grow your hair long.


  Anyway, I'll see you
 tomorrow at 10:00 a.

m.


  And you won't be late because
 you've got that watch.


  (groans)
  Stupid parenting experts.


  Why don't they write a book
 called Stop Buying These Books?
  Everybody'd buy that.


  Even if I was listening
 to what you said,
  it doesn't matter; nothing matters.


  My trophy business has failed
  and Bart has the thing I wanted most:
  Grampa's watch.


  What watch?
  The one you get for being a success.


  Well, then I should have it.


  Uh, that never really came up.


  All that's left to do now is
 bring these to the needy.


  Best I can do is charge you ten dollars
  to throw them in my Dumpster.


  How about I give you a trophy
 that says "Best Pawn Shop"?
  Not unless I earned it.


  (gasps)
  Dad's watch!
  Hey, dirtbag shopkeep.


  How did this come to you?
  Mm.

 Some kid brought it in.


  Said he was mad at his friend
  for dropping so many rocks in his eye.


  That dude's seen a lot of living.


  Yours for 20 bucks.


  That's an insult.


  You're talking about a
 self-worth-boosting antique
  that's been in my
 family for generations.


  Twenty-two?
  You'll take it all and you'll like it.


  (maniacal laugh)
  Yes.

 I have it.


  Some said it would never happen.


  Most were unaware of the situation.


  But I finally have my father's watch!
  (maniacal laugh)
  (singsongy): Oh, Bart,
 look what Daddy's got now.


  (Bart crying)
  Grampa was the only person
 who believed in me.


  But when he finds out I lost the watch,
  even he'll give up.


  (sobbing)
  Stay strong, Homer.


  Don't go soft on him now.


  This is a once-in-a-lifetime
 face-rubbing-in.


  Mm.

 Come on, foot.


  Kick, damn you!
  (grunts)
  (sighs) Son, I found something
 that belongs to you.


  (gasps) Grampa's watch!
  No.

 I can't take it.


  I didn't earn it, so I don't deserve it.


  You were right.


  I am a screwup.


  But, boy, who screwed you up?
  (gasps) You.


  It was you.


  And those who came before.


  (choking loudly)
  It's stuck in your hand fat.


  Oh.

 You got to wedge something
 in there to break the vacuum.


  (grunting)
  Okay.


  Smile, my little watch watcher.


  (camera clicking)
  That was a nice thing you did.


  Which parenting guide told you to do it?
  Well, baby, sometimes you just
  got to trust your gut.


    (watch shatters)
  (choking)
         


                





                    			1
 D'oh!
  There's nothing too short
 that I can't cameo.


  Intramural softball,
  where even the most overweight tubbo
  can pretend to be an athlete.


  Play ball!
  You play ball!
  - Hey! Oh!
 - Hey! Oh! This guy!
  Those Indian Point Nuclear jerks,
  they think they're so great
 because their fallout radius
  includes Manhattan.


  How many Mets games can you postpone?
  Fuggettabowtit!
  - Hey! - Oh!
 - Pizza!
  - Tattoos!
 - Verrazano Bridge!
  Everyone is so out of shape.


  It's like watching maple
 syrup play softball.


  Yeah, Dad hit a home
 run five minutes ago
  and he's still rounding second.


  Let's just call it a triple.


  Oh.


  The triple, the most
 exciting play in baseball.


  Except this time.


  Fun fact: the odds of a
 baseball hitting a bird
  are one in a billion, but
 I've seen it four times.


  We're out of beer!
  Burnsie, old buddy,
 you care for a cigar?
  Oh, thanks, but no.


  If I inhale warmed air,
 I tend to float away.


  You ever think we're watching
  the last generation of nukemen?
  No one wants to go into this
 dirty business anymore.


  Fiddle-faddle, nuclear power
 is the industry of tomorrow.


  Oh, yeah? Says who?
  Life magazine,
  The Saturday Evening Stenograph,
  and Professor Noodle Stroodle
  and the Dove Soap March of Comedy.


  Me? I'm thinking of getting
 into, uh, to solar.


  I won't use it myself,
  I'll sell it to the poor
 people and the musicians.


  Oh, not me.


  I vow that nuclear power will continue
  long after my body is gone
  and my brain is in a shark
 that can walk on land.


  I'll educate a new generation
 of nuclear workers.


  And I'll find those
 bright-eyed radio-activists
  at my alma mater: Yale.


  Hey! Yo!
  I'm eatin' Mister Softee over here!
  Hey, kayak on the Hudson!
  It's always wonderful
  when a successful
  - And childless.


 - alumnus returns.


  It's delightful how you take
 turns sniffing after my money.


  Now here's a group that
 was established in 1909.


  Pfft.

 I hate modern music.


  The Whiffenpoofs.


  I'll buy you a new library
 if you have them killed.


  So many have tried to kill them.


  But other smug jackasses in white gloves
  would just take their place.


  We can't be stopped.


  Well, I am here to offer you money.


  I'd like to endow a Department
 of Nuclear Plant Management.


  Wonderful.


  Of course we can't do nuclear.


  Our students are highly-entitled wusses.


  You'd be creating a space
 for violence to happen.


  How about funding a chair
 in the non-narrative cinema
  of self-identified pan-sexuals?
  What? What? What? What? What?!
  We also need to hire more deans
  to decide which Halloween
 costumes are appropriate.


  Eight deans should do it.


  Is this still
 a coven of capitalism
  where evil money can acquire
 a patina of virtue?
  Yes, that's in our charter.


  But with an issue as hetero-patriarchal
  as nuclear power,
  we'll have to hire
 multicultural empathizers,
  build a new safe space.


  Not so fast.


  We insist on a chair of
 anti-nuclear studies
  and a nuclear-neutral
 curriculum pathway.


  Absolutely, Teddy.


  We run all decisions
 past the squash team.


  Also the fencing team, water polo
  and Handsome Dan the mascot.


  Release me, you hound.


  Oh, yeah.


  What's happened to this place?
  This was the home of
 ruthless media disruptor
  Samuel F.

B.

 Morse.


  Who's his successor? That fellow?
  "Fellow"? That word is
 cis-gender-normative, okay?
  You're worse than Hitler!
  Too late for flattery.


  I'm not giving this school a dime.


  Former Bonesman!
  Living or dead?
  Living, but you'd better hurry.


  Engage cloaking device.


  Ah, nothing relaxes
 me like a stiff drink
  from the skull of Martin Van Buren.


  Care for some Pancho Villa?
  Ugh.

 Has everything in this
 school surrendered to diversity?
  Yale's on its way out.


  That's why I started my
 own line of colleges.


  287 campuses.


  We took over all the old Circuit Citys.


  Really?
  Using teachers these holier than
 thou Ivies fired for cause.


  I celebrated Columbus Day.


  I, uh, referred to God as "He.

"
  I got five students pregnant.


  Hmm, I could start my own college.


  Whoa, whoa, whoa.


  We can't talk business in here.


  Just general schemes
 for world domination.


  Fraternal handshake?
  Oh, all right.


  You are on my radar.


  What you doing, Mr.

 B?
  I never want to see the
 word "Yale" again.


  We're changing all our locks to Schlage.


  Eh, to be honest, I'm thinking
 of starting my own college.


  You can make a big fat profit.


  A for-profit college?
  Eh, that's where I went.


  University of Phoenix,
 Oklahoma in Washington State.


  At least that's where it was last month.


  It moves around quite a bit.


  A for-profit college?
  You said that already, sir.


  A for-profit college?
  Excellent.


  Kudos.


  And now for your first economics lesson.


  So long, suckers!
  Boola Boola?
  Moola moola.


    and you can't make it
 without a college degree.


  But for some reason
  worthy students don't always get in.


  Students these days don't
 have four years to waste
  at a fully-accredited institution.


  Burns University will
 grab you by the pants
  and fling you into the
 job of your dreams.


  Elder care associate.


  Museum manager, nighttime.


  TV re-capper.


  Burns University
 gives you a degree
  you can print on your computer.


  Out of the sight of the law.


  I'm proud to be the first in my family
  to earn non-transferable credits.


  I've made a billion dollars
 through ruthless backstabbing.


  But now, for no apparent reason,
  I seem to be helping young people.


  So start your future today.


  Because at Burns University
  Your life gets the full Monty!
  What are you laughing at?
  Does "the Full Monty" have some
 sort of naughty double meaning?
  If only our faculty could
 be hired so easily.


  Oh, but we already have a faculty: them!
  Sir, these people can
 barely run the plant,
  much less teach on the side.


  Smithers, when you think of
 teachers, what do you think of?
  Low-paid workforce with no healthcare
  in a toxic environment.


  And there you have them.


  Just pull them off one-by-one
 till the power stops.


  We'll be fine.


  What are you teaching, Dad?
  I'm giving lectures
 on what I do at work.


  Well, what do you do at work?
  Well, I you know, the button stuff.


  Have you prepared a reading list?
  I have to read?
  - No, it's for them.


 - Whoo-hoo!
  But what are you actually
 gonna say to them?
  I'll start with the
 life cycle of the atom.


  A baby atom is called a "neutron,"
  when it turns professional,
 it becomes a proton.


  And if it runs for office,
  it's an electron.


  Lisa, did you just drink that?
  How'd you guess?
  No, "sheriously.

" Oh, wow.


  Wow, my first slurred word.


  Dad, a college education is important.


  It's my only hope for
 getting me out of this
  pardon me, Mom dump.


  Lisa, go to bed right now.


  Oh, keep your pants on, lady.

 Dad!
  Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad!
  I believe in higher education.


  You are a teacher.


  If you make a joke out of it,
  you are
 crushing my only hope.


  As the good kid here,
 I have to point out
  she's acting very badly.


  For shame.


  Lisa, sweetie, my professor money's
  going into your college fund.


  Ooh, that's good, I guess.


  How much is in it now?
  Depends on what we do with
 Grampa after he dies.


  Just burn me!
  Ooh, well, that's the
 most expensive option
  I'm considering.


  Welcome to Burns University.


  Don't park at Del Taco.


  Our motto: Ut uberiores divites.


  Well, doesn't that mean
 "The rich get richer"?
  Ooh, this prestigious school
  doesn't need Latin-translating
 troublemakers.


  You're expelled!
  When do I throw this in the air?
  You're a professor, so
 you don't throw it.


  In fact, you hardly ever wear it.


  Geez, I had this custom-made.


  Apartheid's over, Lenny.


  It worked!
  Mm-hmm.


  Man, copying is so hard.


  Any questions?
  Yes.

 What does it mean?
  Uh, what do you think it means?
  Remember, there are no wrong answers.


  Well, I would guess that, uh,
  three neutrons coming out
 when only one went in,
  uh, leads to some kind
 of chain reaction.


  Wrong.

 There's always a class clown.


  Ten-minute coffee break.


  Um, any of you homies want
 to sell Schedule I narcotics
  to a fellow teenager?
  You're a teenager?
  What year were you born?
  Hey, you're not the cop around here.


 I am!
  What?
  Oh, right, my cover.


  Seriously, people.


  Some of us are here to learn.


  Professor, half-life of
 radium, if you please.


  Don't look at book!
  Ugh.

 You're crushing me.


  What the hell is that?
  Guys.

 You know what?
  It's a beautiful day.


  Why don't we have class outside?
  Yes, that's it.

 Go on outside.


  I'm totally unqualified.


 I don't even know
  how to get outside from here.


  That's the answer!
  Oh, wait.


  Hey, what's the matter, Professor?
  He don't know what to teach his class.


  Homer's just not cut
 out to be a pedagogue.


  That's easy.

 You just got to register.


  Stay away from playgrounds.


  Oh, you said "pedagogue.

"
  So this is what it's
 like to fail at something.


  I can help you, Dad.


  Aw, if it isn't Daddy's little wino.


  No, I'm clean.

 One day clean.


  Yeah, I know that tune.


  Just come with me.


  You don't have time to learn anything,
  but at least you can
 have a sense of mission.


  I got these for you.


  Dead Poets Society, Stand and Deliver.


  Each one a portrait of a great
 teacher, told by Hollywood.


  Played by stars, each one paid
  more than a teacher makes
 in a million lifetimes.


  I always cry at the end
 of Goodbye, Mr.

 Chips.


  Mr.

 Chips is my name for my Fritos.


  Just watch the movies.


  Words and ideas
  can change the world.


  Oh, look at the world!
  It just did a boom-boom in its pants.


  You, you change it.


  Go to the woodshop and make
 yourself a push broom.


  You're gonna need it.


  It's not a tumor.


  Oh, they were great.

 They inspired me.


  And the best part is where they show
  the real guy over the credits.


  He looks just like the actor but fatter.


  Okay, listen up.


  All it takes to be a great
 teacher is to care.


  And I care.


  So I'm a great teacher.


  I don't like you, and you don't like me,
  but I'm your only ticket
 out of the barrio.


  Â¿Comprende, Ã©se?
  I understand.

 I understand plenty.


  Do you know you can get a hot shower
  by hooking up your hose
 to your car radiator?
  Towel off with the floor
 mat and feel like a king.


  Good.

 Now he can bring the rest
 of the Latin Kings in line.


  Okay, first lesson.


  Always watch out for a little rod
  falling into the back of your shirt.


  I do it, like, every week.


  Now remember, your chair
 has three levers:
  down, back and lock.


  Down, back and lock.


  - Together.


 - Down, back and lock!
  Down, back and lock!
  Down, back and lock!
  Down, back and lock!
  Carpe diem!
  So, Andre, is it true?
  You're dropping out of my class?
  May I ask why?
  I well, I
  I-I want to go back to
 counseling at-risk teens.


  No, Andre.

 You don't get
 to throw your life away.


  I'll be here for every class.


  Carpe diem.


  Carpe diem.


  Just what does that mean, by the way?
  Fish for a dime, my friend.


  Fish for a dime.


  How much are we charging
 for hugs, Smithers?
  Five dollars.

 But, uh, I'll
 give you one for free.


  Quiet.


  Monty, I want to buy the whole school.


  But it must include Homer Simpson.


  He is a great teacher.


  But first I must find out how
 much he's worth to the plant.


  I see.

 It seems I owe you a
 hundred thousand dollars.


  Great lecture, Professor S.


  I finally understand how gamma rays
  turned Bruce Banner into the Hulk.


  Always remember the equation,
 "gamma equals green.

"
  Man, I wish you were my father, Dad.


  Uh, Simpson, I've sold your contract.


  No! You cannot stop me from teaching.


  I was going to paint
 houses in the summer.


  Nothing will stop the
 greatest teacher in the world
  from painting houses!
  Oh, calm down.

 You'll
 be working for this man
  at his private estate.


  What? Me?
  Alone? Without my kids?
  Yes.


  Sounds good.

 Who are you?
  The owner of more for-profit colleges
  than anyone in the world.


  But these students are
 going to miss you.


  Thank you!
  I just want to say,
  each and every one of
 you gets an incomplete!
  I can't hear him.

 Can you?
  Nope.


  Love was the test.


  And you all passed.


  Uh, folks, we'll be landing at Mr.


 Verlander's
  secret estate shortly.


  A flight attendant will
 be coming by to put
  a blindfold over your eyes.


  Cabin crew, please wipe your memory
  and prepare for landing.


  Which way do I go?
  Uh, use the map!
  D'oh!
  Homer Simpson.


  Voice does not match file
  from 1989.


  Let's go out
  for frosty chocolate milkshakes.


  Welcome, Homer Simpson.


  Whoa.


  Hmm.


  Hmm? You unload your own dishwasher?
  Yeah.

 If you don't, you
 get a, a funny smell.


  Now, come in.


  Are you tired from your trip?
  Let's get you a refreshing cryofreeze.


  Rejuvenating, huh?
  It opens your pores.


  Uh, what happens if I pee in this?
  Are you just asking?
  Or did you already pee in it?
  I'm asking for a friend.


  So what's our next activity?
  I hope it's not square dancing.


  I'd like you to meet
 the rest of my guests.


  Hmm.


  Homer, say hello to the greatest
 educators in the world.


  Neil deGrasse Tyson, astrophysicist.


  The Solar System is over four
 and a half billion years old.


  Jeopardy! champion of
 champions, Ken Jennings.


  Who is "glad to meet you"?
  Financial educator Suze Orman.


  You are not allowed to buy a Mercedes
  until you pay off your credit cards.


  Great, now you tell me.


  Screenwriting guru Robert McKee.


  Welcome to the act three climax,
  resolution of story and subplots.


  I expect you're wondering
 why I've assembled a team
  of the world's greatest teachers.


  To teach something.


  To somebody.


  Well, there are only six basic plots.


  Rise-fall, fall-rise,
  steady fall, steady rise,
  black cop-white cop,
 and stop that wedding.


  Well, here's what I'm up to.


  This is Sallie.


  And these are Sallie.


  And those are Sallie!
  And those
  are Sullys.


  Robot replicas of the
 greatest pilot of all time.


  He lost all their bags.


  No one talks about that.


  You are the greatest living
 educators, of humans.


  But now you must face
 the greatest challenge
  of your lives:
  Can you teach an
 artificial intelligence?
  To teach a robot.


  Now you've compounded my interest.


  That was a very useful time cut.


  Now, let's find out what's going on.


  Leave that to me, Robert.


  What's going on?
  I'll tell you, and I won't
 kill you afterwards.


  What? This is a student
 loan application.


  Mm.

 Sallie
  Sallie Mae?
  The Federal Student Loan Program?
  You're creating an army
 of robots so advanced
  that they can get student loans.


  That's right.

 These stu-bots
 or ro-dents, if you prefer
  will attend the universities
 I've been buying up
  and funnel billions of
 taxpayer dollars to me.


  That's it.

 As Americans,
 it's our duty to either
  stop evil billionaires or elect
 them to the highest office.


  Well, we've done it.

 You're all
 up to your polyurethane necks
  in debt and heading to Yale.


  Follow me.


  Boola Boola.


  Boola Boola.


  Good luck, Homer.


  Will I see you at the last
 minute saving the day?
  Nah, too clichÃ©d.


  The Sallies have blended right in.


  We've got 12 productions
 of The Crucible going on,
  and the deepest Division
 III women's lacrosse team
  the world has ever seen.


  They're perfect students in every way.


  And that's their weakness.


  Bleep, blop, bloop.


  Bleep, bloop, blorp.


  I am a robot, too.


  My father was a toaster.


  He's in botface.


  That's unbelievably offensive.


  Microaggression.


  Cultural appropriation.


  - Offensive.


 - Offensive.


  Offensive.


  Dear Lord, those teachers
 made them too human.


  You've ruined me.


  Well, not completely.


  I still have my health.


  So, how much will it cost if my
 daughter applies in ten years?
  $2,000.


  That's not so bad.


  - That's the application fee.


 - Oh, yeah.


  Lisa, do you see the rings of Saturn?
  I do.


  The question is, what is five-sixths?
  Marge, listen to me.


  You can't fix stupid.


  You have to kill him for the insurance.


  I've always said these
 tags are pointless.


  Story's over.

 Good night.


   Release the hounds.


  Shh!
     


                





                    			1
   Rock-a-bye baby 
  In the treetop 
  When the wind blows 
  The cradle will rock 
  When the bough breaks 
  The cradle will fall 
  And down will come baby 
  Cradle and all.

 
  Sweet dreams.


  (light switch clicks)
  The whole Fox Network was
 in a hot, dense state 
  Then nearly 14 billion years ago 
  They began a TV show 
  Then Bart tried to sell his soul 
  Lisa turned to vegetables,
 Grampa started fighting bulls 
  -  Springfield built a wall 
 -  The Who played on the top 
  Carl, Lenny, Barney, Moe 
  And a fat bald guy who hollers "d'oh" 
  It all started with
 The Simpsons, d'oh! 
  -  I'm just a gigolo 
 -  Gigolo 
  -  And everywhere I go 
 -  Gigolo 
  -  People know the part 
 -  Gigolo, gigolo 
  -  I'm playing 
 -  Gigolo, gigolo, gigolo 
  -  Paid for every dance 
 -  Gigolo 
  Showtime.


  Ooh, and they're sayin' 
  Gigolo, gigolo, gigolo 
  Your tea, Nana.


  - (laughs)
 - Sweet darling boy.


  BART: I know what you're thinking.


  This must be some kind of prank.


  Is there laxative in the punch bowl?
  Well, there is, but their
 doctors prescribed that.


  I've changed.


  I've become pinchable.


  You look confused.


  Why don't I start from the beginning?
  Grandpa, Grandma 
  We love you 
  We will show what school can do 
  We cleaned our desk,
 we learned this song 
  Teachers beat us when you're gone 
  Grandma, grandpa, you're the best 
  Now you can be laid to rest.

 
  Simpson.

 Those lyrics are
 unapproved and not that funny.


  Come with me.


  Hey, Skinner.


  Sure, you're tough enough
 to punish a little boy,
  but what about a Marine Corps veteran?
  Oh.


  Mm-hmm.


  Okay, Seymour.


  Note to my mom or detention?
  Which of your two lame weapons
 are you gonna unleash on me?
  I have other weapons.


  SKINNER: I have no other weapons.


  Seymour, walk me to the bus stop.


  Mother, what are you doing here?
  I wanted to make sure you remember
  that I think your job is stupid.


  Simpson, I thought of your punishment.


  Bart here will walk you to the bus stop.


  That'll kill two birds with one stone.


  (chuckles)
  First time a worm ever killed a bird.


  (Bart laughs)
  LENNY: Okay, Lenny, don't be nervous.


  This is the big one.


  Gotcha! Where am I?
  (scoffs) You walked in the core.


  Yeah, we better seal
 this thing up tight.


  (meows)
  I'm playing Peekimon Get, see?
  That's a wild Rotata.


  That has got to be the stupidest
 game I've ever heard of.


  Oh, yeah, you're right.


 It's really a kids' game.


  And it's silly for me to
  Quiet, I'm playing it.


  (air horn blows)
  Quitting time.


  Three-day weekend.


  (Homer yelping in panic)
  Haw-haw!
  Bart's holding hands 
  With an old lady 
  Who seems kind of sweet 
  And my grandmas are gone 
  One's in jail, and
 one's in dirt jail.

 
  Back in a flash, Grandmama.


  Try not to win any beauty
 pageants while I'm gone.


  Oh.

 (laughs)
  Agnes!
  Oh, you just missed my
 perfect little Martin.


  Eh, I saw him.


  He's beefing up, that's for sure.


  Don't you love Grandparents' Day?
  I get to meet all the little
 boys Martin snitches on.


  Is that your grandson?
  Or is this just a a pity walk?
  - He's not
 - A pity walker?
  I love my Gam-Gam.


  Ha.

 You hear that?
  Gam-Gam.


  What's your pet name?
  Gram-Gram.


  That's the stupidest thing
  I've ever heard.


  I can't believe Martin left you alone
  in this cold hallway.


  Thanks, Peaches.


  You're a gift to this world.


  You deserve to be wrapped up, Gam-Gam.


  - Gam-Gam-Gam.


 - (laughs)
  Gam-Gam-Gam.


  For you, Grandmama.


  A diorama of the sky from
 the night you were born.


  Give me your sweater.


  But-but without it, I'm nippley.


  (both laugh)
  You hear that? Oh, no
  BART: Nippley.


  I always wanted a grandson.


  A cute little guy I could take
 to the circus and the movies.


  Someone I could spoil rotten.


  I'm halfway there, ma'am.


  Well, this is my bus.


  Goes right by the candy store, eh?
  Don't take my mother, I need
 her to make me French toast!
  Egg yolks scare me
  Ooh, a Rattlesnitch.


  (rattling)
  (laughing, whooping)
  Got it.


  - Got it.


 - Lo tango.


  Duffman has got it.


  Got it.


  - Got it.


 - Got it.


  Got it.


  Got it.


  - Got it.


 - Got it.


  Now that's a spicy Peekiball.


  Got it.


  (gibbering)
  And so Aw, I didn't get it.


  Won't anyone help me?
  Got it, and no.


  Now Maggie, there's no
 monster under your bed.


  Ooh, there is one on your face.


  Oh, man, there's like a million in here.


  Here's the phone, so you can see them.


  Nighty night.


  (creatures growling)
  In the gospel according to Luke, uh
  (sighs) If you two don't mind.


  Look this game is, or at least was,
  bigger than Jesus, okay?
  Hmm, that's a pretty low bar these days.


  Ah, Skunk-a-san.


  Why can't I capture you?
  (screams) It's real!
  D'oh!
  (gargling)
  (moaning)
  Sprayed by a skunk.


  Homie, that game's too dangerous.


  The game was fine.


  Reality was dangerous.


  And could you move a
 little to your left?
  There's a Stumble-Bee right behind you.


  Oh, is there any fad you
 don't take too far?
  The aerobics ones.


  Mom, what Dad could use is a co-player,
  who makes sure he doesn't get hurt.


  Because the game is good for him.


  You can see that he's lost
 weight from the walking.


  I'm using the factory holes on my belt.


  Oh, wow.

 Wow.


  Lisa, why are you interested?
  Because it's the greatest game ever.


  In this world, I can throw a ball.


  Hmm, okay.


  (grunts)
  I'd prefer if you didn't
 turn your skunk bath
  into a giant cocktail.


  Ugh.

 One damn rule after
 another around here.


  Peekisaurus at the Kwik-E-Mart.


  Please come in.


  Enjoy your game from which
 I do not make a dime.


  (laughs) I'll be darned
 if this little critter
  doesn't look like your god.


  And I'll be darned if this sad wino
  doesn't look like your god.


  Do unto Snickers as you would
 have Snickers do unto you.


    Oh.


  Well.


  Such good manners.


  I went out to get you some sneakers.


  The kind that gang members wear.


  BART: Heaven.

 But I
 couldn't help thinking,
  why settle for one golden goose,
  when you can have a gaggle?
  Bessie, have I seen your
 grandkids in church?
  No.

 I don't have any grandchildren.


  Here's my headshot.


  BESSIE: Oh
  BART: In fights with your
 children, I take your side.


  (gasps) And what's this?
  I have a loose tooth.


  Oh!
  (Bart chuckles)
    BART: It might've felt more like a lie
  if I had to say the word "grandmother.

"
  Fortunately, my ladies like
 to be called anything but.


  Good morning, Momo.


  I love you, Geema.


  Momtom!
  Na-nee!
  Ugogo!
  Waipo.


  Hey, who wants a box
 full of firecrackers?
  They won't light up the night like you.


  Aw.


  Man, nothing beats ladies in their 80s.


  Twice my age plus 60.


  Perfect.


    (screaming)
  (whirring)
  (steam whistle blows)
  Ketchup? In my kitchen?
  Never!
  (laughs)
  (whistling)
  Bart?
  Hey, Mom.

 Want a pep-o-mint drop?
  Yes, but since when do you carry those?
  Oh, I got it all.


  Altoids, butterscotch candy,
  Jelly Bellies, and Turkish delight.


  (phone ringing)
  Hello?
  It's someone named Gertie.


  Is that a girl in your class?
  I know a lot of Gerties.


  Did it sound like she was
 talking through her throat?
  Uh, I'll just give you the phone.


  GERTIE (through electrolarynx):
 Hello, sweetie, I didn't know
  if you wanted PlayStation or Xbox,
  so I got both.


  Maw-maw? I ordered so many toys,
  you get free shipping.


  Oh, so thoughtful.


  Interested? My card.


  Book now for Christmas.


  I was juggling 50 shades of gray.


  I've been watching you.


  I know exactly what you're up to.


  I'm not up to anything, lady.


  (through electrolarynx):
 This is for you.


  Thanks for coming to my brother's wake.


  It's what I do.


  You are a cold little customer.


  Agreed.

 Now, are we done here?
  Because I've got birthday
 checks to deposit.


  I've got birthdays like
 Lindy's has pickles.


  Do you even know what that means?
 Do you?
  What is this? Pick On
 the Con Artist Day?
  I'll pay you $100 to pick
 me up, four days in a row,
  from the Sunnyday Nursing Home.


  Sunnyday, that's on Fifth, right?
  Yes.

 Ask for Phoebe Pratt.


  Oh, my dear, you look
 like Cybil Shepherd.


  I am Cybil Shepherd.


  Impossible, Cybil Shepherd
 is notoriously difficult.


  Aah!
  Oh, my God, everyone,
 it's Cybil Shepherd!
  So it turns out you can
 buy Peeky creatures
  with real money.


  But the fun of the game is
 catching them, not buying them.


  Lisa, I can think of
 no better investment
  than invisible creatures that
 are part of an over-hyped,
  passing fad.


  - Please?
 - I'm in.


  You know, I'm really
 starting to like you.


  - Mmm.


 - Mmm.


  I'm here for Phoebe.


  Weren't you just here for Eunice?
  Hey, a guy can have two grandmothers.


  Look it up.


  All right, you've served your purpose.


  Good-bye.


  A hundred bucks to walk you to the curb?
  Sunnyday is a secure facility.


  A family member must sign me out.


  Why are you there? You seem normal.


  Happy anniversary.

 Got it!
  My family fear I'll wander
 off into some forest.


  So where are you going?
  Well, that forest over there.


  Mm, I better come with you.


  Those woods are full of bullies.


  So, did you get it?
  Yep, here's the orzo.


  You idiot, you were
 supposed to get ouzo.


  Orzo is, like, thick, brown rice.


  You're like thick, brown rice.


  (grunting)
  It's good stuff.


  So, Pheebs, tell me about yourself.


  I'm a nature photographer.


  Wow, two things that
 won't exist in 20 years.


  Oh, you're quite good at taking
 the piss out of someone.


  Wait, that's okay to say?
  Taking the piss.


  Taking the piss.

 Taking the
 piss, taking the piss.


  Taking the piss.

 
  Have you gotten that out of your system?
  I'll get up in the middle of
 the night and say one more.


  Poor old buck.


  Probably the last spring he'll
 make it up the mountain.


  Want me to throw a rock at it?
  No!
  He'll know when his time has come.


  We all do.


  (bellows)
  Hey, I got to be me.


  Right, it's been four days.


  As we agreed.


  Um, I don't feel right
 taking your money.


  I bequeath this to you.


  "Bequeath"?
  - What does that mean?
 - Oh, look it up.


  Good-bye, Bart.


  (snoring)
  Aah!
  I'm having brunch with my little
 man and I need the bus pass.


  Mother, you know that
 boy is a ne'er-do-well
  and possibly a scofflaw.


  Seymour, it's time you lived your life.


  I will live my life.


  And I'll start by leaving
 my hair mussed up.


  MRS.

 SKINNER: And comb that hair.


  I'll finger-comb it, is what I'll do.


  BART: Oh, bequeath
  Bequeath, bequeath.


  I can't believe she's making me do this.


  I'm gonna look up a word.


  How do you look up a word?
  I'd like to look up a word.


  Give me your phone.


  - What's the word?
 - "Bequeath.

"
  This means something you
 give away when you die.


  She must be sick.


  How much do I owe you?
  Oh, no, it's
  five dollars.


  I'm here to see Phoebe,
 it's kind of a surprise.


  But she left this morning.


  She said you were waiting outside
  and I didn't bother to check.


  What kind of a nursing
 home are you running here?
  Oh, is it panic you want?
  Patient missing! Patient missing!
  What's with you, Judy?
  He knows my name.


  (alarm blaring)
  Those tracks were made
 by tennis balls, Lou.


  Get me files on Pete Sampras
  and the Williams sisters.


  BART: I realized she had me
 pick her up four days in a row
  so the home's guard would be down
  and she could leave on her own.


  But why?
  He'll know when his time has come.


  We all do.


  Can't believe I missed that.


  Or this.


  Don't tell anyone, I plan to off myself.


    Okay, these Peekimon
 cheats cost us 600 bucks.


  No one but you or I must know.


  I'm starting to suspect that
 trophy was not real gold.


  Can we talk about something else?
  Absolutely.


  After you put your
 fingerprints on this knife.


  Dad!
  It's a cake knife.


  I just had an extra piece.


  Two extra pieces.


  Okay, two extra cakes.


  But all cakes are pieces
 of something bigger.


  Just touch the knife.


  Dad, why are you making
 me hide things from Mom?
  You're right.


  That's my job.


  Well, it's my fault too.


  No, sweetie, no more secrets.


  From now on we're an open book.


  - Guys!
 - How much did you hear?
  We may have to get rid of the boy.


  I don't know what you're talking about.


  - I need you to look for something.


 - Forget it.


  I learned from Peekimon
 that's a slippery slope.


  Especially that time I fell
 down a slippery slope.


  Look, this isn't a stupid game.


  I'm looking for a lady
 who may be in trouble.


  - Is it Patty?
 - No.


  - Is it Selma?
 - No!
  Let's roll.


  This is where we used to go.


  Bart, what were you up to?
  Being the perfect grandson.


  For our grandma?
  No, for everybody but her.


  Now please, we got to find Phoebe.


  Well, we'll need the help of
  experienced Peekimon searchers.


  Hmm.


  This is who we're looking for.


  Oh, you're no fun.


  What's her Peeki-name?
  Um Dame Judi Dentures.


  (searchers laugh)
  And her point value?
  I don't know, a zillion?
  (all exclaim)
  Okay, let's do it.


    LISA:  I want to be the very best 
  This is my new career 
  HOMER:  And then take
 a long, long rest 
  And celebrate with beer 
  LISA:  I will travel across the land 
  Catching beasts who've done no crime 
  HOMER:  Playing games made in Japan 
  I love to waste my time 
  LISA:  This is fun for everyone 
  Even babies play the game 
  Maggie cannot 
  Say a word 
  But watch her stab
 and kill and maim.

 
  I found something.


  (owl hoots, bone crunches)
  Peekimon searchers, huh?
  Well, that's the stupidest
 thing I've ever
  Found her!
  (voice breaking): Oh, my God.


  Hello.


  Oh, I-I seem to have fallen asleep
  in this forest
  with apparently excellent Wi-Fi.


  Uh, yes, all the trees
 are cell phone towers.


  What are you doing out here?
  Oh I'll-I'll admit I-I
 had some dark thoughts
  and I used you to escape from the home.


  But once I got out here by
 myself, completely free,
  I realized there's so much to live for.


  And I want my camera back.


  Can we still hike sometimes?
  Yes, and we could go inside
  that mill house you love so much.


  Milhouse is not a place, it's a nerd.


  Oh, well, there you go.


  BART: So that's it.


  I learned playing with women's
 hearts is a dangerous game.


  And it's wrong to take
 advantage of the elderly.


  And Grampa?
  I'm sorry I embarrassed
 you on Grandparents' Day.


  Geez! I thought my stories were long.


  - Homer?
 - Uh what?
  I know about the $600.


  You're right, Marge.


  We spent too much.


  Bart was a gigolo.


  What are you gonna do?
  Be mad at the world?
  (groans) Maybe you could say something
  to make me feel better.


  The kids are fine.


  The game is a fad, and in no time at all
  you'll be worried about something else.


  Huh, I do feel better.


  Hmm, you know, the last
 couple of pies I baked
  haven't been great.


  There you go.


  I like your hair.

 Finger-combed?
  Yes, because I decide how my hair looks.


  MRS.

 SKINNER: Seymour!
  Just wanted to tell you
 I'm here with a real man.


  My silhouette's replacing
 yours on the stairs.


  (Milhouse chuckles)
  So enjoy your meal, son.


  I'm buying dessert.


  Oh, that's so nice.


  For you,
  not that son-snatcher.


  (grumbles)
     LISA:  I want to be the very best 
  This is my new career 
  HOMER:  I want to give
 this game a rest 
  I've been playing since last year 
  SEA CAPTAIN:  I play
 it on my little boat 
  Sitting in a cove 
  Yar.


  OTTO:  I ran my bus right off a cliff 
  Was playing while I drove 
  LISA:  This fad was hot 
  And then was not 
  These things come and go 
  HOMER:  All I know is once again 
  I wasted lots of dough.

 
  (snarling, growling)
  Shh!
     


                





                    			1
  What? Cheap, lousy
  Ah, there.


  Springfield the city sleeps.


  The Simpsons 
  Interesting fact, the
 singers that sang that song
  are all dead.


  Enjoy the show.


  Hello, family!
  I'm 20 minutes away.


  Can I bring anyone a?
  Mmm, pork chop.


  Flanders, you need a new mailbox!
  Are these from the gas station?
  Uh, Marge, please.


  They're from a supermarket
 that sells gas.


  Were you at Moe's?
  Yeah, celebrating St.

 Patrick's Day.


  Ah, the Blarney Stone,
  Angela's Ashes, centuries of troubles.


  It's not St.

 Patrick's Day.


  Well, on the real day,
 the price of green hats
  goes through the roof.


  I thought you'd be happy
 I was saving money.


  Cheap hats? You ruined Sunday dinner
  for cheap hats?!
  That's not You know, forget it.


  Thanks for the flowers.


  I'm sure they were nice,
 but they're wilting now.


  Honey, when you were talking
 about those flowers,
  was it a metaphor for anything?
  Was it?
  Honey? Metaphor?
  So I thought she'd be
 furious, but nothing.


  She was as aloof as Steve Martin.


  Ahoy-hoy.

 This is Sector 7G, where
  where, uh What does go on here?
  Mostly we decide which of us should be
  on the lookout for you.


  Which was supposed to be you, Lenny.


  Coo-coo-coo
  Yes, well, this is Nigel,
  an old boarding school chum,
  and, uh, this Piccadilly
 Circus walkup is his wife.


  I have to go, luv.


  I've got to pick up a lip
 tint at the chemist's.


  Farewell, darling.

 You
 take the sun with you.


  You never told me about her.


  Well, you never told me about
  your handsome young man.


  Who, Smithers?
  He just works here.


  Smithers, I see you're one of those
  truly devoted people who make one forget
  love is an illusion.


  Uh, time for your pill, sir.


  Did you swallow the
 cheese and not the pill?
  Nuh-uh.


  Show me.


  That's a good boss.


  Such devotion.


  My wife is in love
 with her tennis coach,
  Rolando.


  Like the first time I saw profit.


  A day doesn't go by
  Hey, Homie.


  That's our cue.


  Lenny, when you say "That's our cue,"
  then you're supposed to leave.


  Dear God, so many times
  I must have looked like a complete ass.


  Homer, this is the part of the marriage
  where the needle is on "E,"
  but we still have a little more gas.


  The brink of doom, where
 I do my best work.


  And I want to break out of our rut,
  Oh, honey, you've given
 me a big appetite.


  For what?
  a non-food answer.


  - For you?
 - Oh
  Well, I have to admit,
  that was suggested by the nose.


  Finally, some credit.


  Mmm
  Wait, I want to know that
 you're really gonna change.


  Marge, I get it.

 I truly get it.


  And to prove it, I'm eating a carrot.


  Oh
  Mmm.


  Sir, do you need help with that tea bag?
  No, I can talk to Nigel by myself.


  Nigel, you were wrong
 about the Crimean War,
  and you're wrong now.


  Love can endure.


  Oh, I could dissolve
 that union as easily
  as the tea dissolves this sugar.


  Smithers, did you see him
 heft that sugar cube?
  Did I.


  and I'd wager five million on it.


  - Sterling or flesh?
 - Sterling, this time.


  Oh, that money is as good as mine.


  Look at them spooning.


  Hmm.


  Excuse me there, Simpson.


  May I buy you a drink?
  Thanks, Alfred, but my marriage is
  - And I want to get home.


 - Now, now.


  I'm an old friend of your boss',
  and if you turn me down,
  it will not go down favorably.


  Will it go down unfavorably?
  Mm, it may.


  Very well, then.


  No texting your wife.


  I'll just tell her I'm
 drinking with an English guy.


  What does that mean?
  He'd better just be around the corner.


  Oh.


  Oh!
  And everyone left the hot tub
  except for Ringo, Princess
 Margaret, and me.


  Yeah, uh, listen, Dr.

 Doolittle,
  I like hearing you talk,
 but I got to get home.


  So, been married long?
  Knocked her up right after high school.


  I can't listen to that story
 without getting weepy.


  Hey, hey, that's my talking bar rag!
  Let go of that!
  You doing all right there, Raggy?
  Yeah, that's good.


  So, Homer, the only woman
  you've ever been with is your wife.


  How shall I put this?
 You thumped one melon
  and left the store satisfied.


  If you knew anything
 about me, you would know
  I would never, ever shop
 in the produce section.


  Homer, have you ever thought
 there might have been
  other melons bigger,
 smaller, more exciting?
  Oh, the women I could have had.


  You drew me in fifth grade,
  and I've never gotten over you.


  I like a man who pours me on everything.


  Oh
  I think it's time I
 went home to my wife.


  I fear my seed landed on barren soil.


  Oh, yeah, he's crazy about that Midge.


  Eh, she's got it all.

 Hair
 that goes on forever
  Moe, I always wondered something.


  Why, Marge, of course.


  What the
  Wait'll Midge hears about this!
  Hmm, this might be worked
 from another angle.


  So, Moe, you find Homer's
 wife attractive?
  Yeah.

 She barely knows I exist.


  Which is the only thing
 I got going for me.


  Well, how would you
 like me to set you up
  in a more elegant establishment?
  More elegant than this?
  Aah!
  This may just be the bonk on
 the head talking, but sure.


  Oh.


  Marge, I know I'm late,
  but I'm really sorry.


  "Sorry" and "Congratulations, Graduate.

"
  They had a two-for-one sale.


  - Now, I'm late because
 - Don't bother.


  - But there's a really good
 - It's too late.


  - But you're gonna laugh when you
 - No.


  I just have to accept that
 you're never going to change.


  No, no, don't give up.


 I've changed before.


  I lost my hair and got fat.


  Good night.


  Oh, good night.


  - How was your night?
 - The usual.


  So, it's Saturday morning.


  What do you want to do today?
  - Nothing.


 - Hey, Homer,
  I got an extra ticket for the ball game.


  Box seats.


  He'll take it.


  Marge, no.


  Flanders ruins baseball.


  He adds the word "Lord" to the end of
  "Take Me Out to the Ball Game.

"
  Take me out to the ball game, Lord 
  Take me out with the crowd, Lord 
  Buy us some water 
  And that's just fine 
  All I drink is communion wine 
  For it's pray, pray,
 pray to our Jesus 
  If we don't win, it's His will 
  'Cause He's one, two,
 three Gods in one 
  At the baseball church 
  We're at church.

 
  D'oh.


  Hi, hon, I'm near Moe's,
  but I can come right home.


  I haven't even put a coin in the meter.


  Just what I needed to hear.


  Oh Oh, damn it.


  Aw, maybe now I can finish my novel.


  I just wish I hadn't left it in there.


  Yeah, well, don't worry,
 you still got old Moe.


  Moe 2.

0.

 It's a whole new me.


  I even bought one of those new gizmos
  that everyone's using.


  Why'd you close the bar?
  Well, I've been set up in
 a high-end establishment
  by a well-heeled backer.


  MoHo House?
  that celebrities who
 don't want publicity
  can be sure to be seen at.


  I'm going there now.

 Don't tell anyone.


  Tonight is the grand opening
 for the town's hottest
  new destination, run by
 the man most in demand
  for Springfield's haunted
 houses, Moe Szyslak.


  Oh, sorry, force of habit.


  How you doing?
  Good to see you, Mr.

 Mayor.


  Bumblebee Man, Â¿cÃ³mo estÃ¡?
  Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.


  No can do, Mr.

 "Movie Star.

"
  Your last picture
  was a bomb.


  The trailer gave away too much,
  like, uh, the fact that it was terrible.


  I deserve a good time.


  I can have a good time.


  The heck with Homer.


  Thanks for the lift, Homer.


  I really don't think you're
 taking this seriously enough.


  What are you up to, Nigel?
  Oh, just stacking the deck in my favor,
  as sporting men are wont to do.


  A posh club, beautiful
 single men and women,
  irresistible temptations
 to my unsuspecting quarry.


  Good luck breaking them apart.


  - See you.


 - Hmm.


  I can have fun by myself.


  and use it as an excuse to meet me?
  Can I eat the cherry first?
  Don't take too long.


  I might; I asked for extra cherries.


  They don't charge for extra cherries.


  Monty, what say we make this
 wager something meaningful?
  Like what?
  How about my entire fortune
  against your boy Friday?
  Smithers?
  Oh.


  Well, I can't possibly lose.

 You're on.


  Mr.

 Burns, you can't use
 me as a gambling chip.


  Check your contract.


  I'll be darned.


  It also says I'm permitted
 to mold your hair
  into whimsical shapes.


  Smithers want a cracker?
  Got to get a better lawyer.


  Ooh, those fingers.


  The chimp yes, the clown no.


  Don't tell me,
  it's because I'm Jewish.


  No, it's 'cause you're a has-been
  nobody likes, all right?
  Please tell me it's because I'm Jewish.


  Moe, good to see you.


  Oh, good to see you, Midge.


  Boy, who knew you'd look so
 great in a strapless dress?
  Well, thank you.


  Methinks I see my opportunity.


  Why are you telling me?
  I always considered us friends.


  So, let Uh, what's your name there?
  Brant Brant here
 pour something for you.


  We got loads of microbrew
 with crazy names,
  like, uh, Hops-along
 Cassidy and Michelob.


  So, uh, where's Homer?
  We're not spending as
 much time together.


  Whoa, this night, when I opened up
  a fabulous new bar,
 just got interesting.


  Hey, Stogie, how about
 a little "Moonglow"?
  Not the real moon.


  Oh, you mean the drug.


  No, the song.


  "Moonglow," that's my favorite song.


  Yeah, you came into my
 bar seven years ago
  and you played it on the jukebox.


  I remember things like that.


  So, you want to dance?
  I actually do it a lot, but, uh,
 nobody sees behind the bar.


  I guess one dance couldn't hurt.


  So, can you start Monday?
  Oh, you won't break up the Simpsons.


  I'm not used to getting my arms
 all the way around someone.


  Oh, God, I can't work for a
 man I'm not in love with.


  I've got to fix this now.


  Simpson, you need to patch
 things up with your wife now.


  We're fine.

 Excuse me, bartender?
  I ordered three dozen wings
 and I only count 35.


  Listen to me,
  this was gonna be a birthday
 present for my mother,
  but I want you to give it to Marge.


  Okay, what's the gag?
  You have to reconcile with your wife.


  Mm, there's always a catch.


  I've seen a whole different
 side of you tonight, Moe.


  Whoa, she's waving me home
  like a third-base coach.


  But could I really do that to Homer?
  Damn it, I need time to think here.


  Sorry, this is great, but I got
 to go stick plastic ribbons
  onto toothpicks.


  That don't just happen.


  If Moe can change, why can't my husband?
  Well, um, seems to me the reason
 your husband won't change
  is 'cause he knows he's got
 a great thing with you.


  If he suddenly treated you different,
  that should worry you.


  I mean, duh, I guess.


  You know? Duh?
  - Hey, Marge.


 - Homie!
  I got you something.


  What the?
  That's not from you.


  Can't you at least open it so
 I can find out what it is?
  Marge, I got the best gift
 I ever got you in my life.


  Huh?
  Okay, that's not great.


  And why, if you were trying to be close,
  would you spend the whole
 evening away from me?
  Hey, you've taken me off
 the market since I was 18,
  which I immediately regret saying.


  Look, I'm on my knees.


  Why aren't you forgiving me?
  I'll follow you.


  Ow, hairbrush.


  Ow, alphabet blocks.


  Ow, dog toy!
  Wasn't even a card for me.


  I hope you kids haven't lost
 any respect for your old man.


  Uh, can't lose what you don't have.


  Thanks, boy.


  Ow! Oh!
  Something wrong, boss man?
  When you finally get a shot
 at what you always wanted,
  do you really want it?
  Frankly, that's a white person problem.


  Wow, I never had one of those before.


  Hey, what you playing there?
  Oh, just a little something
 I've been messing around with
  that may or may not be a
 commentary on your situation.


  It was hopeless and new 
  New from the start 
  Her hair was blue 
  As blue as my heart 
  Her husband was fat 
  And not very smart 
  So I'm writing this song
 to tell you it's wrong 
  To love 
  An elephant's wife 
  It's wrong, baby.

 
  Homer don't treat her right.


  She should be loved.


  Loved like Barney loves my bar.


  He's thinking of me, I know it.


  This is going in my new novel.


  My mind's made up.


  There's only one thing I can do.


  Whoa, that's a conflicted look.


  Are you a cashier or a psychiatrist?
  I was a psychiatrist.


  Then I lost my license for
 prescribing too few meds.


  You came.

 I wasn't sure you would.


  He wasn't sure you would 
  Let's go somewhere more private.


  There's cameras everywhere.

 
  I needed to see you.


  You're supposed to be my friend, Moe!
  How could you meet my
 wife behind my back?
  I did it because I'm your friend, Homer.


  And that's why I invited you here.


  To tell you that if you don't
 treat this woman right,
  someone's gonna take her away.


  Now, it won't be me,
  but you don't leave the lid
 off a pickle jar like her.


  Right, Midge?
  First of all, it's Marge.


  No, I know, I-I don't know
 what my deal is with that.


  But you're right about everything else.


  Marge, I treasure you.


  And to prove it, here's
 something I drew last night.


  Okay, we haven't
 achieved all our dreams,
  but the day I met you, I had them.


  I love you.


  I love you, too.


  - Mmm.


 - Mmm.


  Maybe some day I'll find happiness,
  but not today.


  Ugh.


  Mm-mm-mm.


  A very touching scene.


  Pleasure doing business with you.


  Uh, sir, who are you talking to?
  Why, Nigel here.


  Sir, you're imagining people again.


  Well, then who gave me this check?
  That's a coupon for free frozen yogurt.


  Bah!
  Where is he going, and why
 is my check torn to shreds?
  You don't have to pay
 him, he'll be fine.


  Use me in a wager, will he?
  - Mmm!
 - Mmm.


  Wait a minute, this
 place was just built.


  It must have been MoHo 
  For Homer and Marge 
  They got back their mojo 
  And now they're living large 
  Still I hear you saying 
  What happens to Moe? 
  He'll go back to his hellhole 
  That's the ending of the show 
  Except for the tag.

 
  Okay, sir, we've revised my contract,
  so you can no longer
 proffer me in a wager,
  throw me in a volcano,
  use me as a chew toy for your tiger
  Sabu will be disappointed.


  Use me as a human Christmas ornament,
  or jack-o'-lantern, lit.


  But I still agree to be
 mummified with you if you pass.


  Excellent.


   Mm, it's good to be back.


     


                





                    			1
 Bring up the couch.


  I'm a return!
   D'oh!
  Turn left.


  You're the driver.


  Watch it, ya jerk!
  Turn left.

 Don't look at me.


  Look at the road.


  Yes, dear.


  In 50 feet ago, U-turn
 without signaling.


  Oh
  Turn left, into Garbage Alley.


  Mmm.


  Uh, uh
  Huh? What? Huh?
  What the hell do those mean?
  Can't stop, I have to hit one of them.


  Man or dog?
  Oh, it's a Snoopy's Choice.


  I guess your days
  of eating out of the
 garbage are over, Gil.


  Hey
  I was never here.


  I saw nothing.


  Now I do have to warn you, if Gil sues,
  he'll end up with everything you've got.


  But that's everything I got.


  Okay, kids, give me your
 best worried looks.


  Ooh, that's good worry.


  And Maggie, when we visit Gil,
  you should think about your mom
 and me disappearing forever
  any time we step behind a wall.


  Where am I?
  Where am I?
  No, seriously, where did I go?
  It's so dark in here.


  Maggie!
  Ol' Gil,
  there must be something
 we can do for you.


  Hmm? Hmm?
  Ah, there sure is, you can
 let me scratch your husband.


  Sure, but why?
  Because you're the lottery ticket
  I've been waiting for all my life!
  Bam!
  Zing! Before this goes any further,
  can you just take one look
 at our darling daughters?
  Mr.

 Gunderson? They don't let
 saxophones in the I.

C.

U.

,
  so I'll just tell you the
 song I wrote for you.


  B-flat, C, D-flat
  If memory serves, you have a son.


 B-flat, C
  Where's he at?  Long G.

 
  I'm here
 to give Mr.

 Gunderson his shot.


  Boy, the "putting him in a coma" idea
  was just dinner table chatter.


  I did not sign off.


  You tapped your nose.


  I was scratching it.


  Well, I got to put something in a coma.


  Why, you little
  Well, I'll see you in court.

 Zing!
  Ah, cha-cha-cha!
  Cha-cha-cha?
  That's hopeful.


  Cha-cha-ching!
  Oh.


  Your Honor, my client had
 just turned his life around.


  His daughter recently
 bought a washing machine
  and promised him the box to live in.


  Do you think they'll
 send Dad away forever?
  Oh, no, sweetie.


  They just want all our money.


  Will they send us to
 live with other families?
  Miss Simpson, from now on
 you shall live with us,
  receiving musical instruction from Mr.


 Adolphe Sax himself.


  Adolphe.

 A name that
 will only be associated
  with beautiful music.


  We'll be free to
 do whatever we want.


  A thousand bucks a kidney?
  Take them both.


  Hmm.


  Ay, caramba!
  Mr.

 Simpson,
  you deliberately ran your car
  into my paycheck I-I mean, my client.


  No, "paycheck" is better.


  What possible defense could you have?
  I had no other choice.


  I didn't want to hit a dog.


  Aw
  A dog? He saved a dog?
  He was gonna save a dog.

 Wow.


  People love dogs.


  This is our key to winning this case.


  You're on my side, right?
  I am.


  Now, go ahead, son.


  You tell us how you got your dog.


  It was Christmas, sir.


  We saved him and he saved us.


  Now we love the dog,
  and the dog gives us all
 the love we could handle.


  Love.


  Aw
  Could the stenographer
 read that last part back
  with sentimental music?
  "The dog
 gives us all the love
  we could handle.

 Love.

"
  Does the defendant ask this court
  to believe that in order
 to avoid hitting a dog,
  it is acceptable to hit a human--
  my client?
  It's looking good, Homie.


 According to our consultant,
  the toughest nut to crack
 is juror number six.


  Aw, good doggy.


  Ladies and gentlemen, this
 man is a human being,
  just like you or me.


  Surely his life has more value
  than some creature that scoots
 its buttocks along the ground.


  Aw
  Or-or gets its head stuck
  in an empty pickle jar.


  Aw!
  Or walks on a hot sidewalk
  in a way that suggests it's dancing!
  Aw!
  This is ridiculous.

 I'm
 a human being here,
  not some dumb animal.


  - What?
 - I never.


  Who are you calling dumb?
  The dogs who sniff for
 bombs at the airport?
  The St.

 Bernards who save lives
 on the slopes of St.

 Moritz?
  Or this one?
  Now, I have a brief
 instruction for the jury:
  "There's more sanctity
 in a dog's loyalty
  than there is in all your human laws.

"
  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, how
  Not guilty.


  Case dismissed.


  We won! It's all because of you, boy.


  Mwah.

 CROWD: Aw
  Aw, I have never been more glad
  that I didn't hit you with my car,
  secretly bury you, get
 another greyhound,
  paint it your exact coloring,
 then realize it's a girl,
  stick on a fake wang, and
 pretend that she's you
  for however long dogs live.


  Aw
  Take us to the dog park!
  I know I've been through a lot,
  but I always believed people
 cared about a human being
  more than a dog.


  Hold it, I forgot
 my phone charger.


  Oh, wait, this isn't mine.


  It's now official: a
 Springfield jury has decided
  that the life of this
 greyhound is more valuable
  than the life of this
 Greyhound station inhabitant.


  Look at me, I'm a big man.

 A big man!
  Anybody got a quarter?
  Got to be a quarter, not
 two dimes and a nickel.


  That ain't worth jack.


  What's your take on all
 this, Anger Watkins?
  I'm angrier than a beehive
 in a paint mixer.


  This is the craziest legal decision
  ever made outside of Arizona.


  What's next? Cats get credit cards?
  Let a snail race in the Indy 500?
  Like that
 stupid movie Turbo?
  I tried to inhale nitrous
 oxide to get fast.


  I ended up naked behind
 an appliance store!
  Lies!
  Lies! Lies!
  Oh, you're gonna get
 ten walks a day, boy.


  You can
 even bite the mailman.


  There he is.


  America's number one doggy daddy.


  Would you care to do the honors?
  Would I!
  Uh, that's what I asked.


  Would you?
  You're the greatest man
 I know one thing about!
  Look at all those voters.


  What is our current position on dogs?
  We currently have a city employee
  who rounds them up and
 puts them to sleep.


  What? I can't believe such a jerk
  would even be elected dog catcher.


  From this point forth,
 this town will be known
  as the dog-loving capital of the world.


  That'll put Springfield on the map.


  Yeah, why aren't we on the map?
  I don't know.

 I made, like,
 20 calls to Rand McNally.


  They don't even know
 what state we're in.


  Thanks to these hastily-passed
 untested pandering laws,
  Springfield is now the most
 dog-friendly city in America.


  Er, uh, arf.


    Is there anything here the
 dogs haven't gotten into?
  Just the dog food.


  Why are you shutting me down?
  You made a dog wait for a teeth cleaning
  while you saved a racehorse's life?
  And you call yourself
 a veterinarian.

 Ha.


  And you know what we found inside?
  Dogs in cages.


  That's no way to treat
 man's best friend.


  Lock him up.


  In a cage.


  Like a dog.


  Don't you understand?
  Dogs are born to follow and obey.


  The moment the pack realizes
  that humans are no longer their masters,
  thousands of years of
 domestication will fall away.


  They'll revert to their
 wild wolf nature.


  Well, then I guess you'll be happy
  being nice and safe in jail.


  Oh, yes, please! Take me there now.


  You're all doomed!
  Doomed.


  Santa's Little Helper didn't
 come home last night.


  If you were a dog these
 days, would you come home?
  It's like doggy heaven
 out there, only real.


  Doggy heaven isn't real?
  No! No, it's real!
  The dogs all have harps and wings.


  How do they play harps if
 they don't have fingers?
  Um dogs have fingers in heaven.


  How do you know so
 much about dog heaven?
  I died for five minutes and
 was sent there by mistake.


  Now leave me alone.


  Hmm
  Ooh! Come on, girl.


  Ow! Ow, ow.

 Just get him by the collar.


  You can do it.

 Come on, don't bite me.


  Come on.

 Pull.

 Come on.


  Dad, we don't have time for this.


  Quiet.

 I'm doing something important.


  There you go.

 Yes, that's it!
  Well, well, well,
  look what the cat dragged in.


  - Worth it.


 - Totally worth it.


  I know.


  Kirk, Taquito is digging up my dahlias.


  - Stop him.


 - Mm.


  Sorry.


  Please don't hurt me.


  I'm exposing my belly.


  See? Exposing.

 Exposing!
  See ya later, Moe!
  Huh? My car's not starting.


  Oh, I see the problem.


  Out of gas.


  Well, probably safer to walk anyway.


  Yep, nothing safer than walking.


  This is so healthy.


  Thanks to this walk,
 I'll live a lot longer.


  Hey, here come some of
 my four-footed friends.


  I guess you want to meet
 the guy who's responsible
  for making all your lives better.


  Okay, wait a minute.

 Let me guess.


  Collie, dachshund, Tibetan Mastiff,
  otterhound, Swedish Vallhund,
  Finnish Spitz, Norwegian Lundehund,
  Catahoula Leopard Dog,
 Lagotto Romagnolo,
  and three wolves!
  Stand back! Back!
  Ow!
  Oh!
  You don't scare me.


  Your bark is worse than your bite.


  Oh, those horrible barks!
  Dr.

 Budgie warned them.


  Dr.

 Budgie warned all of them.


  But did they listen to Dr.

 Budgie?
  All right, that's it.


 I'm comin' in there!
  Oh, for cryin' out
  Maybe if I turn sideways.


  Lou, get the bar butter!
  This is what happens when you
 buy European prison cells.


  Kids,
 lower the Purge armor!
  We don't have any Purge armor.


  Oh, right.

 I always mean to buy
 it the day after the Purge,
  - when it's cheaper.


 - What happened?
  The dogs have gone savage!
  They've taken over the town!
  No, boy.


  Resist the call of the wild.


  Like I did when they assigned
 that book for summer reading.


  Somebody help! Stop him!
  D'oh!
  Oh, we've lost him to the pack.


  No, he's a good dog.


  He'd never turn against us.


  Hmm, he's ripping the stuffing
 out of your car seats.


  Oh, yeah?!
  You think you're so smart?!
  Okay! I'm eating your dog food!
  This is on you!
  Mmm.

 Oh, yeah.


  Hmm.

 Not one student showed up to school
  just because a pack of
 ferocious, masterless dogs
  are roaming the playground.


  Ow! Damn it!
  I thought we sent Willie out
 there to deal with them.


  I did.

 But he, uh, hasn't returned.


  I've finally been accepted
 for who I truly am.


  How come I don't get a dog-proof suit?
  Because I smell like lamb, Lou.


  Very well.

 You were right
 and we were wrong.


  Yes.

 Um, can you remove the shackles?
  Don't push your luck.


  These dogs, they walk
 around all high and mighty,
  no regard for anyone else on the planet.


  I mean, that's humans' job!
  Repeal the stupid new laws!
  Yes.

 Repeal the dog--
  and child labor-- laws!
  Fine, just the dog ones.


  I say "status," you say
  Quo!
  So passed!
  Well, everything's back to normal again.


  It's a pity no one told the dogs that.


  - Huh?
 - Wha?!
  You fools have surrendered
 your position as alpha dogs.


  Until you reassert human dominance,
  it is you who will be calling
 these savage canines master.


  Who among you is brave enough
 to tame this slobbering horde?
  Well, I guess it's up to ol' Gil.


  Gil? Why are you helping these people
  who think so little of you?
  That's why I'm doin' it!
  To show everyone I'm
 not the town failure.


  I thought I was the town failure!
  You're not even that.


  Aw!
  So who will come with me?!
  None of us!
  One more time!
  Nobody!
  I can't hear you!
  Yes, you can!
  Standing next to me
  is the man whose life we all agreed
  was worth less than a dog.


  I say we stand behind him
 as he redeems himself!
  Even though he did nothing wrong.


  Gil, Gil, Gil, Gil,
  Gil, Gil, Gil, Gil, Gil,
  Gil, Gil!
  We've got to get Santa's
 Little Helper back.


  It's too dangerous!
  You kids ain't goin' nowhere!
  I got this.


  Fine.

 But we can't go out alone.


  We need someone who knows
 how to fend off angry dogs.


  Here, boy! Come on, boy!
  Oh, where can he be?
  Grampa, I called to make
 sure the kids are okay.


  They're not okay! The boy's got sass,
  and the girl thinks
 she's Queen of the May.


  You leave 'em with me and
 I'll straighten 'em out!
  I did leave them with you.


  Why the hell would you do that?!
  - Here, boy.


 - Here, boy.

 Here, boy.


  It's the alpha.


  I know that dog.


  It's the one Milhouse got
  when he didn't wet the bed for a week.


  We're about to die at
 the hands of a dog!
  Paws.

 Dogs have paws.


  Just remember the last thing you
 did in life was correct me.


  Oh, that actually makes me feel better.


    This has gone on long enough!
  You sit!
  I'm sorry!
  Mom, you've become the alpha dog!
  Dogs are nice.

 I love dogs.


  Because, in dogs, we
 see the things we wish
  we saw more of in people:
  lifelong friendship, unwavering loyalty,
  and a willingness to
 eat anything you cook.


  You rang?
  Ol' Gil's here to save the day!
  Where are those out of control pooches?
  Sorry, ol' Gil, you're too late.


  But-but I was supposed to redeem myself
  and finally earn the town's respect.


  Uh, good job, Gil.


  You had to stop at the Automat
 for an egg salad sandwich.


  Well, at least you still
 have the sandwich.


  Uh Aw
  Baz, you belong with the Flanders.


  Okily-dokily.


  Dalmatian, fire department.


  Mr.

 Burns, the hounds.


  Excellent.


  Uh, since you were gone,
  all I had to release were the June bugs.


  Willie, Skinner.


  Aw, good boy.


  Oh, you're my best friend 
    Ooh, you make me live now, honey 
  Ooh, you make me live 
  You'll have your day.


  It's gonna be hard to cheer
 myself up after this day.


  Hey, little fella!
  You had a bad night, too, huh?
  Come on out.

 I won't hurt ya.


  You just licked
 away a very bad day.


    Attaboy!
  Shh!
     


                





                    			1
 The Serfsons.

 
   Aw, water soup again?
  - (squawks)
 - Now it's crow soup.


  Ooh, I call an eye!
  - Me, two!
 - Me, three!
  And Maggie gets the beak.


  (squeals happily)
  - (neighs)
 - (all gasp)
  Your hovel got in the way of my horse.


  Kiss his hooves in apology.


  Mm! Mm! Mm!
  (chuckles): Oh, please,
 forgive us, noble steed.


  Mm! Mm! Our nostrils are not
 worthy of your mighty stench.


  Mm! Mm! Are those new horseshoes?
  Oh, they look good on you!
  Mm! Mm! Mm!
  (neighs)
  (disgusted whinny)
  Lousy nobles!
  We serfs are starving,
 while they're feasting
  and jousting and posing for tapestries
  where they're friends with a unicorn.


  As if any unicorn would like them.


  Unicorns like nice people
 I'm a nice person.


  Young lady, that kind of
 talk is anti-feudalist,
  and I won't have it!
  Without feudalism, we
 wouldn't have this hovel,
  our bountiful filth,
 or my awesome buboes.


  Ooh-hoo.

 I'll lance you later.


  (panting heavily)
  (inhaling deeply)
  Bart! They just stuck
 new severed heads up
  on the city walls!
  Oh! Can we go, Ma? Can we? Can we?
  That's a lovely idea.


  Oh.

 And we can bring my mom.


  I hope she's doing okay
 in her new nursing home.


  (snoring, wheezing)
  Which one is your mom's web?
  GRAMPA: Son, is that you?
  No.


  MRS.

 BOUVIER: Ah, you ruined my nap!
  Just like you ruined my daughter's life.


  That's her.


  They didn't skimp on the tar.


  That's the secret to long-lasting heads.


  Ooh, there's Ned Flanders!
  It's always nice when you know someone.


  Those are the kind of sideburns
 I was saying you should grow.


  Hmm
  Pretty sharp.


  Pretty, pretty sharp.


  See how the heads of rich people
  get the tallest pikes
 with the best view?
  It's so unfair.


  I told you to lay off feudalism.


  It's the only system we know.


  We have no choice about it,
 and therefore it's the best.


  The system is designed to keep us down.


  That's not true.


  In a great country like ours,
  a poor girl can grow up to
 be anything she wants
  a wife or a harlot and that's it.


  I wanted to be a harlot,
 but it's all who you know.


  It's never too late.


  Everyone is somebody's weird fetish.


  Mom.

 What's wrong with your skin?
  It's blue, and ice-cold.


  This could be a serious disease.


  Homer, she needs medical attention.


  Pretty, pretty sharp.


  (bells tolling)
  It's never easy to say this.


  You've got Genital Snerfs.


  SNERFS:  La, la, la-la, la-la 
  We love our new home.

 
  Doc, is there any way to
 control occasional flare-ups?
  Nope.


  - Yeah! - Yay!
 - Yippee!
  (groans)
  Now, what have we here?
  Progressive frozen-mortification!
  This can only be the bite
  of an Ice Walker!
  An Ice Walker?
  Mom, how did this happen?
  Oh, I dated a ravenous wight
  who abhors the warmth of the living.


  - And?
 - He got fresh.


  I'm sorry, baby.

 I know I screwed up.


  But you got to give me another chance.


  I love you.


  She's 900 years younger
 than you, you pervert.


  I like 'em young, that ain't no crime.


  (giggling)
  Is my mom gonna be okay?
  Mm, I'm sorry, but a week from now,
  your mother will be frozen solid.


  No! No, that can't be.


  She's barely into her hag years.


  All you can do is give her
 leeches for the pain.


  Here's an organizer.


  So so there's nothing
 we can do to save her?
  Mm well, there's one treatment.


  MARGE: All we have to
 do is buy this amulet.


  My mom is saved!
  Yeah
  but a hundred GP?
  I mean, that's more than a
 tenth-level fighter makes
  in an entire campaign.


  Don't worry, we'll figure it out.


  Hey, sweet young thang.


  What time they cuttin' you down?
  Ooh, baby!
  (humming a tune)
  (grunts, continues humming)
  Okay, we just need to come up
 with a hundred gold pieces.


  How much do we have in our savings?
  Hmm let me think.


  There's that thing
 (mumbling unintelligibly)
  (smacking lips, mumbling)
  What are savings?
  Well, then we can sell our possessions.


  - The pig.

 The spoon.


 - (oinks)
  The gelatinous cube
  has to be worth something.


  DISCO STU VOICE: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.


  Is this because of what
 happened to the cat?
  I told him not to nap on me.


 So that's on him.


  Look, honey, I love your mom.


  As crones go, she's tops.


  But does it make sense
  I mean total sense to
 spend all that money
  so a really old lady can
 get a little bit older?
  This is my mom's life!
  This family will do whatever
 it takes to keep her alive!
  Is that understood?
  Of course.

 Of course.


  - Good.


 - Good.


  Good.


  All I'm saying is
  (grunting)
  - (oinks)
 - Homer Serfson,
  you are the most selfish jerk
 in the entire Tri-Kingdom Area!
  I should have listened to that witch
  and married my twin brother, Markery.


  Always here if you need me, sis.


  Get lost, freak! She chose me!
  You get that money to save my mom,
  or never set foot in this hovel again!
  Good things come to those who wait.


  Oh
  Is Marge still sore at you, Homer?
  Yeah.

 It's not like I
 want to kill her mother.


  I just want to let her die from neglect.


  (groans) If I don't get the
 money for that amulet,
  I'll be sleeping on the iron couch.


  Now, let's see here.

 "An urgent message
  for Milady Gwendolyn Partz.

"
  Uh, Milady Partz?
  Hey, has anyone seen Milady Partz?
  Ah, come on, somebody grab Milady Partz!
  That depends how big is your dowry?
  (all laughing)
  You little craven, if I
 ever get my hands on you,
  I'm gonna slice you open and
 drain all of your humors:
  blood, black bile, yellow bile
  "and phlegm.

"
  (both laughing)
  (strained grunt)
  (yelps)
  Aah!
  Okay, break's over.


  (yelling, grunting)
  Uh, Lord Montgomery?
  I've had some unforeseen
 family medical expenses,
  and I was wondering, could I
 get an advance on my salary?
  Uh, but first, can I have a salary?
  (chuckles) Peasants.


  Serfson, you've pushed that
 wheel around and around
  for 20 years did you ever wonder why?
  Mostly I just push it.


  Have you ever noticed that the wheel
  isn't hooked up to anything?
  (gasps) The rumors were true!
  But your work does produce
 something very special
  human misery
  which, when collected,
 ground into a powder
  and snorted, gives rich people
 tiny wings that do nothing.


  So if you help me, it
 reduces my suffering,
  which means less wing
 powder for my betters.


  I'm glad we had this talk.


  - But I really need the money
 - Flit-flit.


  Thank you for your time.


  Mm
  (knocking)
  (groans) Hi, Azzlan.


  Marge, my child.


  I've come to offer solace
 in this difficult time.


  You mean convert me to your religion
  when I'm at my most vulnerable?
  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.


  I'm just here to ask you
 an important question.


  Have you heard the news?
  Yes, yes.

 I will be saved.


  Thanks so much for stopping by.


  I'm just going to leave you with
 this literature, praise God
  I can't go home and face your mom
  without the money for that amulet.


  In here.


  Do you have your lucky lead nugget?
  Always.


  A lead-lick a day
  keeps the doctor a-blah
    (wind whistling)
  (gasps) Gold.

 Sweet, sweet gold!
  Why didn't you ever tell
 us you could do magic?
  Because if the king finds
 out, he'll take me away
  and force me to be one
 of his evil wizards!
  You necromancing nitwits!
  I wanted an all-seeing eye, not this!
  (sniffing)
  No daughter of mine is gonna
 end up in the hex trade.


  - (nose sneezes)
 - Now, let's go buy that amulet.


  And don't worry, mum's the word.


  Did you say "The Word"?
  Hmm? Ah? Hmm?
  (Lisa and Homer groan)
  - Hi, Azzlan.


 - Hi, Azzlan.


  (grunts)
  12-nothing.


  My serve.


  You know, eventually,
 you're gonna run out of us.


  I said, my serve.


  Mom, I've got a surprise for you.


  Thanks to who?
  I said it when I was 11,
 and I'll say it now.


  You're the greatest
 husband in the world.


  - Mm
 - (gasps)
  Where'd a dirt-poor loser like you
  get all the gold for that?
  (chuckles): Oh, well
  let's just say
  I strangled a leprechaun.


  I'm not wearing that.


  But without it, you'll die.


  - Fine by me.


 - What?!
  I want to die.


  (groans): Oh, typical!
  "I want to live, I want to die.

"
  Just make up your mind
 they're both terrible.


  Oh, I've lived a full life.


  I saw a drawing of an ocean,
  I watched my daughter marry an ogre.


  I am not an ogre.


  My father married an ogre
  after my mother was eaten
 by a different ogre.


  You're my mom.


  I can't bear the thought
 of saying good-bye.


  (sighs)
  You want me to live, I'll live.


  (ringing)
  Let's celebrate!
  I'll roast a hobbit for dinner.


  Mmm
  Bet you a packet
  of South Farthing pipe
 weed she picks me, Gaffer.


  Hush now, lad.


  The big folk will choose who's
 tastiest and no mistake.


  Ow! Ooh!
  Hey! How do you know
 you got them from me?
  SNERFS: We miss you!
  We miss you, too!
  Love you!
  Love you more!
  (Snerfs giggling)
  Ow, ow, ow!
  Hmm.

 Is it really so bad
 for Grandma if she dies?
  Won't she spend eternity
 in the Fields of Bliss?
  - (grunts)
 - SNAKE: Ow!
  Yeah.

 We're all going
 to the Fields of Bliss,
  where the days are passed
 in frolic most joyous.


  BART: Just frolicking? That's it?
  HOMER: Sometimes, you wave
 ribbons through the air.


  But mainly, frolicking.


  Doesn't that get old?
  Did I mention the ribbons?
  'Cause there's ribbons.


  Fields of Bliss? Nonsense.


  The afterlife is an
 eternity of slaughtering
  and being slaughtered by your enemies.


  Oh, yeah.


  You're both wrong.

 After death,
  you spend all day counting
 Goblin Jesus's money.


  (chuckles) And it better all be there.


  71 mermaids.


  Some where the fish is the top part.


  (laughs): Top.


  Mushrooms.


  Everywhere, mushrooms.


  (grunts)
  Frolicking and ribbons!
  Yeah, but what if after
 we die, that's it?
  We're just gone?
  (all gasping)
  So just poof?
  Really? Poof, and then
 just super nothing?
  Mm-mm?
  Well, it's clean.

 I'll give you that.


  (rocking chair squeaking)
  Oh, yeah.


  This is way better than death.


  Come on, Mom.


  There's so many things we
 can say to each other now.


  Oh, really?
  Okay, then, say them.


  I'm waiting.


  Oh.

 Um
  Well (chuckles)
  What about you guys?
  What do you want to ask your grandma?
  I got nothing.

 I'm gonna take a stroll
  and enjoy the golden age of cleavage.


  Lisa?
  Um uh
  Oh! Well, Grandma,
  tell us of your most ardent swain.


  I dated a shape-shifter once.


  I thought I could keep
 him from changing.


  I was wrong.


  Love is a fairy tale!
  Oh.

 Uh
  Every moment with her
 is a precious gift.


  Yes.

 Yes, it is.


  All that matters is that we're a family
  and we're together.


  (all gasping)
  Sorcerer-intendent Chalmers.


  Your daughter has been
 detected using witchcraft.


  Under the Magic: The Gathering Act,
  she is hereby property of the crown.


  What? My daughter isn't a magician.


  Oh, I'm terribly sorry, but she is.


  Yes, the moment that she
 transmuted lead into gold,
  our palantirs they just went bananas.


  I've never seen palantirs go so bananas.


  It was the only way.


  I just didn't want you
 to be sad about Grandma.


  (gasps) Oh, no.

 This is all my fault.


  Don't blame yourself, honey.


  We're all at fault for
 doing whatever it takes
  to make you happy.


  - (gasps)
 - Help!
  You can't nap my kid!
  That's kidnapping!
  Toenail Imprisonum!
  D'oh!
  Lisa's magic?
  Maybe I'm magic, too!
  Abra-carumba!
  Yeah, just grab a stick
 and say a funny word.


  Yeah, that's not insulting to us at all.


  Please don't take my daughter.


  She was only trying to
 save her grandmother.


  She sounds like a wonderful kid.


  Now please say good-bye to her forever.


  Take a peasant, leave a peasant.


  She's gone.

 Lisa's gone.


  Clip me out of here, Marge.


 I'm gonna rescue Lisa
  if I have to kill every
 noble in that castle.


  But Dad, serfs can't
 rise up against nobles.


  You'd be attacking the system itself.


  And nobody loves
 feudalism more than you.


  Son, feudalism is a beautiful vision.


  The Bill of No Rights.


  One person, no vote.


  But I'm willing to betray all that
  to get my daughter back.


  Hey, you mind if I dissolve those?
  Uh, just checking.


  Better to ask.

 Better to ask.


  Peasants, peons,
  and distinguished beggars!
  (chortling)
  Aren't you tired of the nobles
 taking the wheat we sow,
  the yarn we spin,
  and the wine we steal
  from travelers we murder on the road?
  They even take our children.


  And not just the worthless Barts,
  but the magical Lisas.


  (all murmuring agreement)
  If we can put a
 moon-spangled hat on a man,
  why can't we kill a bunch of rich jerks
  and take their stuff?!
  (all cheering)
  (grunting)
  - (grunts)
 - (squeals)
  (grunts)
  (clamoring, shouting)
  (shouting stops)
  How are we going to
 get over these walls?
  Walls
  cannot stop us.


  The trees will fight with you.


  We will never forget your sacrifice.


  Sacrifice?
  We could have torn down
  the castle walls in five minutes.


  (chuckles)
  Trees can't talk, silly.


  (clamoring, shouting)
  (yelling, grunting)
    (pig squealing)
  LISA: Mom!
  Dad! Help!
  Milhouses, save your girlfriend!
  ALL: Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!
  Okay, no, um
  I'm just a friend who is a girl.


  ALL: It's something to build on.


  (dragon roars)
  You peasants are a drag-on the economy.


  Oh! I get it.


  Because he's riding a dragon!
  Aah!
  My love for wordplay is undiminished!
  - (gasps) Aah!
 - (screaming)
  Oh, no! We're losing.


  We need to talk.


  - Now?
 - Yes, now.


  It's time for me to go.


  - (gasps)
 - Life is about moving forward.


  Girls want to be women,
 women want to be mothers,
  mothers want to be grandmas,
  and grandmas want to
 know what comes next.


  But what if I'm not ready?
  I wouldn't leave you if I didn't
 know you'll be all right.


  Okay, Mom.

 I understand.


  Maybe I was born a peasant,
  but I'm going out an ice queen.


  (gasps)
  (groans)
  Ouch.


  Now we won!
  (all cheering)
  - Oh!
 - Mm.


  My mom gave her life to save ours.


  Take comfort, Marge.


  Now she's in the Fields of Bliss.


  No, she's in Goblin Money Heaven.


  The afterlife is snakes
 chewing your eyes,
  but it feels good.


  SNERFS: This is our heaven!
  (sighs): Oh.


  Or, as long as Grandma
 lives on in our hearts,
  then she's never truly gone.


  Until we die.


  Then it's like she never existed.


  And, someday, no one will remember you.


  Or anybody.


  All is well the nobles are defeated,
  the dragon is dead,
  and I've got a daughter
  who can turn lead into gold!
  Ooh.

 Um, actually, I can't anymore.


  Dragon fire is the source of all magic.


  And Grandma killed the last one.


  Everything wondrous and
 extraordinary about our world
  is going to fade.


  (all gasp)
  But maybe now we can use
 science to improve our world.


  With new technologies,
  we can put an end to
 poverty and disease.


  Sure, it'll be hard work,
  but far more rewarding
 than waving your hand
  over a rock to change it into gold.


  (chuckles) I mean
  Please come back, magic!
  Live, damn you, live.


  (dragon groans)
  - (all cheer)
 - I am risen!
  But what about science?
  Oh, sweetie, who would
  want to live in a world without magic?
  It would be so boring.


  People would have to make
 up fantasy stories
  Most of them poorly-written pretenses
  for explicit sex and violence.


  just to escape the
 tedious real world.


  Oh.

 That does sound awful.


  Look! The dragon is burning our village.


  (laughs) I love our life.


  Dry your tears 
  A journey's end 
  The saga's done 
  We part as friends 
  We must away 
  We cannot tarry 
  The minstrel's burden 
  Is ours to carry 
  All other stories 
  Will ever pale 
  For we have sung

  Oh, I have to go all
 the way around again.


  (grunting)

  (panting)
  I had the locker dream again.


  Oh, honey, that's four nights in a row.


  Stupid recurring dreams.


  Why can't brains come
 up with something new?
  That's why they're losing
 viewers to Netflix.

 (snores)
  Maybe I should talk to a therapist.


  Sweetie, our insurance won't
 pay for any more sessions.


  Your father used them
 all up on grief counseling
  after the Halloween candy ran out.


  I've come to accept that
 we were lucky to have it
  while we did.

 (sniffles)
  But I know a cheap
 place where you can see
  the therapists of tomorrow today.


  Behold, Springfield Community College,
  where the students practice on you!
  I only paid a student dentist
 $12 for this brand-new crown.


  See?
  I don't think it's supposed to come out.


  That's why I paid a student
 paralegal to sue him.


  I lost!

 - (humming)
  (school bell rings)
  - Oh, yarr.


 - HOMER: Mm.


  Yarr! Yarr.

  TV must be a circle!
  Ow! Ow, ow, ow!
  Give him the full flea dip
 and deluxe under-worming.


  I'm not a dog.


  And I've been worm-free for two weeks!
  You better muzzle him.

 He's a biter.


  (grunting)
  My name is Annette, and
 I'm a therapist-in-training.


  I'm also a mother-to-be,
  so I know there's nothing more beautiful
  than a child's feelings.


  You sound so caring and professional.


  (quietly): When do I give
 you the seven dollars?
  There's a shoebox by the door.


  (school bell rings)
  So what does my locker dream mean?
  Am I stressed about school?
  I mean, schools are full of lockers.


  Hey, who's the almost-therapist here?
  (Lisa whimpers)
  Huh.


  Hmm.


  Oh.


  Ooh.


  Huh.


  Mm.


  You know, I think you might
 benefit from art therapy.


  Ooh!
  Draw in these empty panels
  to tell the story of a typical day
  in the life of you, Sophia Barnum.


  Huh?
  Once again, learn the patient's name.


  Sorry, Professor.


  Lisa Simpson.


  Excellent.

 Continue.


  Your light's still on.


  LISA: Art therapy.


  Okay, draw a typical day.


  (humming)
  Ugh! Horrible!
  It looks like it was
 drawn by an eight-year-old!
  (blows)
  (humming forcefully)
  Ugh!
  Oh, boy, I can't wait
 to take you to the park.


  The other owners will be so jealous.


  You're not my owner.


  Uh, I kinda am.

 - (erasing sounds)
  - (shouts)
 - (erasing sounds)
  (shouts)
  (Bart whimpering)
  Mmm.


  (grunting)
  MARGE: Mm.


  I'm hearing a lot of feelings in here.


  You're hearing them because
 I am not drawing them!
  Aw, sweetie, drawing is tricky.


  But you just need to start with
 something simple, like people.


  Those are people.


  Ooh.


  (grunts) It's easy, honey.


  Add some eyelashes here,
  some crosshatching to show shadow,
  vary the line width here
 to accent the outline,
  - and voilÃ !
 - (gasps)
  That's great!
  Now in the next panel,
  I want her to be looking out a window,
  wondering if she'll ever get out
  from under the weight
 of her own expectations.


  Well, I could make the
 eyebrows come down in a "V.

"
  LISA: That says it all.


  (Marge grunts)
  Hey, Mom, what if I told
 you the things I was feeling
  and you drew them?
  Okay.

 But I'm warning you,
  I'm not good at drawing turtle feet.


  So if there are any turtles in this,
  they're gonna be wearing sneakers.


  Deal.


  It starts with the
 story of a regular day
  (jazz playing)
        -

        (groans softly)
  Gosh, I forgot how hard school
 can be for a sensitive kid.


  It's miserable.


  But you captured my feelings perfectly!
  (horn honks)
  Annette, wait till
 you see my art therapy!
  You're gonna love it, too.


  Please try to pretend I'm not here.


  Okay, Stephen.


  (humming)
  Hey, where did it go?
  Best marriage counseling ever.


  But we still need to discuss
  your addiction to unboxing videos.


  Do not make me choose
 between you and unboxing.


  Manga!
  (speaking Japanese) 
      It's been a week, and I still
 can't find my therapy comic.


  I'd be just mortified
  if even one person saw
 my private thoughts
  - (gasps)
 - Oh!
  (groans) Mom, can I
 have permission to swear?
  Okay, as long as it's a tier one.


  Damn it!
  That didn't work.


  Can I go to tier two?
  - I'm afraid not.


 - Damn it!
  And with that seal cut,
  we have completed the unboxing
 of the outer shipping plastic.


  Indeed we have.


  (door opens, bell jingles)
  You published my private
 art therapy as a comic book?
  Um, actually, it's a graphic novel.


  The distinctions are threefold
  - Shut up!
 - Okay then.


  Um, in my defense, my wife did it.


  Kumiko, how could you?
  I have acted shamefully.


  I must commit furry cosplay.


  (grunting)
  Ooh!
  There's nothing sexy about shame!
  Except in my native Japan,
 where it's our whole thing.


  Mr.

 and Mrs.

 Book Guy, you
 had no right to do this!
  These are my daughter's feelings.


  And my doodles.


  I shall burn them on a pyre
  and disperse them to the seven winds.


  That's all I ask.


  (door opens, bell jingles)
  LISA: Hmm?
  One Sad Girl, please.


  Sad Girl's the best!
  It's tragically delicious!
  Wait!
  Maybe this isn't so bad.

 (chuckles)
  (gasping)
  My Lulus!
    (indistinct chatter)
  Ooh, there she is.


  Ask for her autograph.


  You ask her, man.


  I'm freakin' out.


  Wow, Lisa, our cartoon book
  seems to have really captured the
  What's that word I'm looking for?
  Zeitgeist!
  Oh, hi, Mel!
  Say hi to Barbara for me.


  I'm not your messenger boy!
  (crickets chirping)
  What's so great about graphic novels?
  They're just comic
 books with no superheroes
  and no cool sound effects like "Thwam!",
  "Ack-ack-ack-ack!",
  - and "Fwwwip!"
 - Snag! (chuckles)
  Lisa, Kumiko called.


  She sold all her copies and
 wants us to make a sequel!
  That's like a prequel but in the future.


  What do you say, sweetie?
  Do you have more sad in you?
  I've got scads of sad!
  Oh, no, not again 
  There they go 
  With pad and pen 
  Collaboration 
  Ooh, collaboration 
    Collaboration 
  Collaboration.

 
  Okay, now draw me
 overhearing the other girls
  talking about how they're
 not gonna invite me
  to a birthday party.


  Like this?
  LISA: Fantastic!
  Now let's take a little break.


  And you know what that means.


  Hot Sharpie!
  Hot Sharpie!
  - Hot Sharpie!
 - Hot Sharpie!
  - Hot Sharpie!
 - Hot Sharpie! (grunts)
  (Lisa and Marge laugh)
  - You almost got me!
 - How come we never bond like that?
  I don't know, you never
 make the first move.


  Okay.


  There is something I've
 always wanted to do with you.

  (raccoon trilling)
  (indistinct chatter)
  Welcome to "Chicks with Pix,"
  a panel discussion with
 women writers and artists.


  I'm your moderator, Roz Chast.


  You may know my New Yorker cartoons
  that are both funny ha-ha
  and funny aha.


  (laughter)
  Silence!
  Joining me today are Alison Bechdel;
  Marjane Satrapi;
  and the creators of Sad
 Girl, Lisa Simpson
  (cheering and applause)
  We love you, Lisa!
  And Marge Simpson.


  (scattered applause)
  FAN GIRL: We're wasting time!
  Marjane, as the author of Persepolis
  and someone who grew up
 in a repressive regime,
  what advice would you
 offer to young women?
  Always remember nothing is more valuable
  than your own unique voice.


  Also, when they promise you
 a tote bag for doing a panel,
  make sure it's not just
 a reusable grocery bag.


  Look at this.


  Alison Bechdel, recently,
  a lot of people have been
 talking about the Bechdel Test.


  Exactly what kind of
 drinking game is that?
  Actually, it's just
 an observation I made
  about how movies and TV rarely show
  two women talking about
 something other than a man.


  That's so interesting.


  I'll have to tell my husband about that.


  (booing)
  (buzzer sounds)
  MAN (over speaker): Bechdel Test: Fail!
  -  Bechdel, Bechdel 
 - (whistle blows)
  Bechdel, fail!
  Fail!
  - Fail.


 - (whistle blows)
  Okay.

 We have five minutes
  before we have to clear the room
  for the "White Men in Comics" panel.


  I have a question for Lisa.


  I have a question for Lisa
 with a follow-up for Lisa.


  I want to talk about
 myself for a few minutes,
  then at the end, pretend it
 was all a question for Lisa.


  Does anyone have any
 questions for my mom?
  She does draw every panel.


  Yeah, I have a question for Marge.


  How lucky are you to work with Lisa?
  AUDIENCE (chanting): Lisa!
  Lisa! Lisa!
  MAN: Lisa win!
  Marge fail.


  (pencil scratching)
  Honey, I was thinking.


  What if we did a chapter
 from the mom's point of view?
  I took a stab at writing
 it up.

 Give it a read.


  In front of you?
  Um, okay.


  Mmm.


  (groans)
  (chuckles)
  What are you laughing at?
  You left out a word here,
  so it just says, "I lonely.

"
  So should I start drawing it?
  Well, there's a lot of great stuff here.


  Really? Because that's
 what I was going for.


  But I'm not sure this is a Sad Girl thing.


  Maybe it's a separate book
  and I could write the forward.


  Oh, I get it.


  This isn't a real collaboration at all.


  You agree with those girl fanboys.


  You think it's all about you.


  Hey, you can't blame me
  if people want to focus
 on my contribution.


  I can and I do.


  I hate to say it, Mom,
  but maybe we should take a break.


  Good idea.

 Hot Sharpie.


  No.

 I mean, maybe we should take
  a real break.


  - You mean?
 - That's right.


  I want to see other illustrators.


  - (Homer grunts)
 - (Marge growls)
  - I don't even know how you could
 - Stupid Lisa.


  - Say that.

 It's my vision.


 - She's acting like a real B.


  Ladies, there's someone here to see you.


  (slurping)
  My name is Guthrie Frenel,
  visionary theatrical
 director and impish genius.


  And I want to make Sad Girl
 into a smash Broadway show.


  (gasps)
  I think he came in through the window.


  - (laughing): Oh, tubby, you're a delight.


 - (Homer whimpers)
  You want to make Sad
 Girl into a stage musical?
  If I may borrow a phrase
 from my father, woo-hoo!
  This is all very exciting,
  but before we go any further
  And I ask this just for clarification
  - What's your deal, weirdo?
 - Dad.


  Guthrie Frenel is a visionary
 director and an impish genius.


  He did a version of Waiting for Godot
  - where Godot appears in the first scene.


 - What?
  And that was nothing compared
 to my vision for Sad Girl.


  I want to do something new and amazing,
  like my all-dog version of Cats.


  But I need something from you.


  - Anything.


 - I need your passion.


  I need your joy.


  Are we all together for this
 three-person toboggan ride
  down Mount Collabor-manjaro?
  Well, Lisa and I did
 just have a little spat.


  Yeah, but conflict is part of
 the creative process, right?
  Not in my experience!
  So are you in?
  - Yes.


 - Absolutely.


  Oh, this is gonna take hours.


  (grunting)
  Bart, there's one thing I
 know about Broadway shows,
  they always make money.


  So I'm already looking
 forward to quitting my job.


  Can I quit school?
  I'd be a pretty lousy dad if I said no.


  It's our duty as artists
  to rip up the contract between
 audience and performers.


  Cell phones will be turned on.


  Candy will be unwrapped during the show.


  We'll hire performance artists
  to make the line for the
 ladies room extra long.


  (grunts)
  Um, how closely are we gonna stick
  to the story from my graphic novel?
  Oh, yes, story.


  All the gimmicky stagecraft in the world
  ain't worth a tinker's damn
  without a compelling
 human story at the center.


  Your story, the unique expression
  - of your heart and soul
 - Mm-hmm.


  Will be neatly summed up
  - in the narrator's first speech.


 - Huh?
  Once that's out of the way,
  we can explore the dazzling
  visual buffet of Marge Simpson.


  Now feast.


  (chomping)
  Pass the wonderment, please,
  but save room for the Tonys.


  Oh, my God.


  It's just how I drew it.


  It's your artistic vision writ large.


  Or should I say, writ Marge?
  You should.


  He really shouldn't.


    (gasps)
  MARGE: It's all in my style.


  Mom, he's ignoring my story
  and making this all about your drawings.


  I know.

 (sighs)
  I'm sorry, Lisa.


  But I can't help it if he wants to focus
  on the visual part of
  (gasps) Oh, my God.


 It's Bart and Grampa.


  But they aren't even in my book.


  And where am I? Where is Sad Girl?
  Sad Girl will be represented
  by a voiceless red light projected into
  an empty seat in the balcony.

 Bold, no?
  But how will they know
 it's supposed to be me?
  - Storytelling.


 - (screaming)
  LISA: Ugh.


  That impish genius is
 really cheesing me off.


  All he's kept from Sad
 Girl is Mom's drawings,
  when it's supposed to be about
 my writing and my feelings.


  Oh, I'm so sick of children's feelings.


  "Feed me.

  You're forgetting the boundary
  between patient and therapist.


  And you're forgetting
 that you did this to me!
  Let me tell you something, Lisa.


  When you give birth to something,
  you have no control
 over what it turns into.


  All you can do is
 surrender to the nightmare.


  (laughing): Sorry.

 I'm just so happy.


  (laughing, then crying)
  Never do this.


  MARGE: Here they are.


  The official Sad Girl: The
 Theater Experience T-shirts.


  $45 in the lobby, of
 which we keep $1.

35.


  Oh, baby, we can use that
 money to buy a sailboat
  with a double-ended spinnaker pole.


  - (whistles)
 - Oh, ho-ho.


  Looks good.

 I like it.


  I like everything.


  Really? You seemed a
 little cheesed off earlier.


  A mother notices.


  Mom, Sad Girl was like our baby.


  And you can't control
 what your kid turns into.


  If it becomes a successful show,
  that'll be good for our family.


  Now if you'll excuse me,
  I'm gonna go sit on a swing alone.


  - Oh, okay.

  Hello, Coast Guard?

 Uh-huh.


  (gasps) Oh.


  (indistinct chatter)

  - So you're okay with this?
 - Sure.


  It's an honor to have
 something based on your life.


  Even if it's nothing
 like your life at all.

    What the hell does any of this mean?
  What? You don't get this?
  It's so stimulating and I love it.

  - What is that?!

      Uh, Guthrie, is it possible we strayed
  a skoosh too far from
 what Lisa's book is about?
  Marge, this isn't You're A
 Good Man, Charlie Brown.


  Or even my production of You're
 A Good Man, Charlie Brown,
  set in a doomed Soviet submarine.


  This is avant-garde
 theater, and it is electric.

  Okay, I guess.


    Oh, Lisa.


  I'm so sorry.

 Hmm.

  Yo, Pazuzu, grow me some horns.


  (HOMER CHUCKLES)
  Those aren't horns, those
 are nubs.

 (LAUGHS)
  No, no, no!
  (NASALLY): Well, at least it'll
 get me out of jury duty.


    Lisa, Lisa wants a better life 
  Lisa, Lisa, go under the knife 
  Homer, Homer got a button wife.

 
  So, anyone want to pick up
 litter at the park today?
  How about you, Maggie?
  She's still got a touch of Pazuzu.


  At least she never threw up.


  (DEMONIC RETCHING)
  That's just great.


  Everywhere but the sink.


  (GROANS) Sometimes I think I
 was born in the wrong family.


  (CAT MEOWING)
  Oh? Hey, Mr.

 Cat.


  What are you playing with?
  A secret door?
  We don't have smoke
 alarms, but we have this?
  HOMER (IN DISTANCE):
 Smoke is its own alarm.


  No, no, Snowball, come back!
  It's too dangerous!
  Sometimes tiny doors lead
 to big opportunities.


  - (GASPS) You could talk?
 - Indeed.


  For centuries, the cat has been
 the symbol of intelligence,
  the other world savoir faire
  Ooh, shiny!
  Oh, there it is.

 Where'd it go?
  There it is.

 Where'd it go?
  There it is.

 Where'd it go?
  (CLEARS THROAT) Enough.


  Let's go meet your other family.


  (GASPS) Other family?
  Already the talking cat isn't
 the most interesting thing.


  - (DOOR CREAKS)
 - (LISA GASPS)
  Whoa! For a Halloween show
 middle segment, this is amazing.


  - (HOMER HUMMING A MELODY)
 - (BART CHEWING NOISILY)
  Every girl's dream, a perfect family.


  (SCREAMS)
  Good morning, sleepyhead.


  For breakfast, tofu or kale?
  Oh, that's nice.


  But what's with the button eyes?
  We don't all have button eyes, silly.


  Some have button mouths.


  (MUFFLED): What's up?!
  Lisa, would you like to jam with us?
  You like jazz?
  (LIVELY JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)
  You're all good, but not better than me.


  I wish I could stay forever.


  Oh, but you can.


  All right.

 Let me guess.


  Do you have to sew buttons over my eyes?
  Don't worry, sugar plum,
  we'll give you a button to bite on
  while we sew 'em on.


  - (SCREAMS)
 - Hold steady.


  (PANTING)
  Oh, sweetie, you're just in time.


  I killed a snake with
 your saxophone and
  Can you blow its head out?
  Here, let me just wipe the
 blood off the mouthpiece.


  Buttons, please.


  Hmm, something's missing.


  Didn't we have a kid
 between Bart and the baby?
  Little smarty pants, plays
 the flute, I think.


  Lisa.

 She's been gone for days.


  And the police have been no help.


  That's not true.

 I helped you
 reassemble that high chair.


  Damn it!
  (WIGGUM GRUNTING)
  Well, we got two kids
 now, so no favoritism.


  Maggie will get Lisa's room,
 Maggie will get Lisa's clothes,
  Bart will get Lisa's homework.


  Cowabunga!
  (MARGE HUMMING)
  (GASPS) Bart! How'd you find me?
  I had an informant.


  I know, he can talk.


  He can? I just followed him in.


  Oh, God.

 Now I'll have to talk to him.


  Uh, I don't think he's coming back.


  How can you be so calm?
  I bore both those children.


  Hey, your stories aren't great,
 but I wouldn't call them boring.


  (GROANS): Oh.


  I'm going in there now.


  You really did it this time, Homer.


  You lost your family.


  Wait, you can speak on this side?
  Yes, I just don't like to.


  Makes the dog feel inferior.


  (WHINING BARK)
  All right.


  (GRUNTING)
  Oh! So tight.


  Why did I eat that
 second lunch at lunch?
  Someone kick me in the ass!
  (GRUNTS) Thank you!
  What is it about this
 world that's so great?
  The Homer in this world
 doesn't pass gas.


  That was a three-button job.


  Would you like to have two eyes?
  We can talk to each other
 while you watch TV.


  Just what Homer needs,
 an excuse to get lazier.


  Why, you little
  I'll lazy you, you otherworldly
  - What the
 - That was my Bart!
  Boy, sure is hard to see
 with buttons on your eyes.


  D'oh!
  (GASPS) You killed my husband!
  HOMER: Spider wife, dead son,
 two girls with button eyes?
  I think this marriage has
 finally gotten out of its rut.


  (VACUUM WHIRRING)
  Yep, I got everything
 just the way I want it,
  including an extra me to go to
 parent-teacher conferences.


  Oh! Bart drew this
 picture of his family.


  Now we're getting visits
 from a social worker
  and an exterminator.


  I'll be ready.


  - (GUNSHOT)
 - (CHAIN SAW BUZZES)
  And I've learned, no
 matter how bad things are,
  they can get much, much worse.


  (MUFFLED): Huh, you're telling me.


  Haw haw.


  (INSTRUMENTS WARMING UP)
  - (CLEARS THROAT)
 - (INSTRUMENTS STOP)
  No one will be seated
 during the third act
  of this Halloween show.


  What you're about to
 see is so disgusting
  you'll watch Game of
 Thrones to calm down.


  You have been warned.


    Man, am I jealous of you guys.


  Two weeks in Lima, Ohio,
 with Patty and Selma
  while I'm stuck here working.


  It's gonna be lonely.

 So lonely.


  Well, if you really want us to stay
  We've already kissed good-bye
 and the car heard it!
  (TIRES SCREECHING)
  They're gone.

 Not a second to waste.


  (LAUGHING)
  (TO "ON THE ROAD AGAIN"):
 Left alone again 
  Yes, I'm eating provolone again 
  Food just tastes better in
 the bathroom now and then 
  I just love being left alone again 
  Left alone for days 
  I ate two dozen bags of Frito-Lays 
  I'm gonna brush my
 teeth with mayonnaise 
  Now my sweat tastes just
 like doughnut glaze.

 
  (SHRIEKS)
  (SHRIEKING)
  Not a single morsel in the house!
  (GASPS)
  A forgotten hot dog.


  Oh, you're shivering.


  I'll take care of that.


  (TO "HAPPY BIRTHDAY"):
 Happy birthday to meat 
  I can't wait to eat.

 
  - Now to slit it down the middle.


 - (DOG BARKS)
  I'm not splitting it with you.


  I'm just teaching you how it's done.


  (BARKS)
  (GROANS)
  Still frozen.


  (SCREAMS) My finger!
  My hot dog!
  (SIZZLING)
  My finger! My poor
  (MOANING)
  delicious finger.


  (SNIFFS) Wait a minute.


  I can't eat my own finger.

 It's unholy.


  Also, it's not quite done.


  But sometimes a man has
 to do the unthinkable,
  like eat something medium-rare.


  Oh!
  (FIREWORKS WHISTLING, POPPING)
  - (TO "HALLELUJAH CHORUS")
 -  Hey, you ate you 
  You tasted great, you 
  Hey, you ate you, hey, you ate you 
  You cooked and ate you.

 
  - (PHONE CHIMES)
 - Hmm?
  Hmm.


  (HUMS SOFTLY)
  Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.


  It makes complete sense.


  I eat more and exercise less
 than the most succulent pig.


  Of course I'm delicious!
  But I must never eat me again.

 Never!
  On the other hand is my other finger.


  And one thing I love is consistency.


  (HUMMING "HALLELUJAH CHORUS")
  Hey, there, Homer Aloner.


  In the absence of the missus,
 you want something delicious?
  (SIGHS)
  Don't worry, I'll be back.


  (WHEELS SQUEAKING)
  Oh.

 Ooh, yuck.


  Oh, disgusting.


  Homer Simpson, you don't
 like steak anymore?
  Actually, I've become a bit of a me-gan.


  Do you have any spaghetti
 with my-balls? Uh, meatballs?
  "Me-gan? My-balls?"
  Are you eating forbidden fruit?
  Fruit? Ugh.


  Sorry, Flanders,
  but I've got more delicious
 meat in my little finger
  than you have on this
 whole picnic table.


  Speaking of which
  ("BUSTIN' LOOSE" BY REBIRTH
 BRASS BAND PLAYING)
  Whoo 
    Whoo.

 
    I have really gone to a lot of trouble
  not to leave the house.


  MARGE (IN DISTANCE): Homie, we're home!
  (SHRIEKS)
  What's with the gloves?
  Uh, I was watching
 Breakfast at Tiffany's,
  and I thought I could be more elegant.


  Elegant? With your waistline?
  I don't think so.


  Actually, Homer, you look
 like you've lost 20 pounds.


  Well, I have been cutting back.


  That means something
 different to me than you.


  What's wrong with your leg?
  Nothing.

 It was perfect.


  (MARGE GRUMBLES)
  (WHIRRING IN DISTANCE)
  (GROANING)
  Homie, you shouldn't be snacking
 in the middle of the night.


  It can't be good for your
  (MARGE SCREAMS)
  This is, without question,
  the worst moment of our entire marriage.


  - What about
 - This is worse.


  Opa!
  HOMER: Marge, I admit it,
 this is a rough patch.


  But I know when to stop.


  And when would that be?
 When you're just a mouth?
  You see how she is,
 Doc? Always negative.


  She makes me feel like nothing.


  You are almost nothing!
  Almost nothing.


  Homer, have you considered
 your wife's feelings?
  Perhaps she takes this new diet of yours
  as a comment on her cooking.


  Marge?
  I won't deny that's a part of it.


  See? Progress.


  Now, excuse me.


  I need to go get famous
 talking about you.


  Homie, I'm afraid this is it.


  Your self-destructive
 behavior has gone too far.


  (MUFFLED): But, Marge
  Good-bye, my love.


  (SOBBING)
  Maybe, deep down, that's
 why I ate myself
  Because I hate myself.


  MAN: Sounds like someone
 had a breakthrough.


  Hi.

 I'm famous
 cooker-upper Mario Batali.


  - You mean "chef"?
 - I don't care for that term.


  Well, I know I don't belong
 in therapy, but why are you?
  I got depressed because I ran out
  of exciting new ingredients.


  Homer, we need to talk.


  Could we wok and talk?
  Well, sure.


  (SIGHS)
  HOMER: My dearest family,
 I love you so much.


  And I think I've found a way
 to earn your forgiveness.


  Please come home.


  Come home to flavor.


  He wanted me to pass
 on these final words.


  "I've failed as a man,
  but I have succeeded as an ingredient.

"
  I call the brain!
  (SIGHS): Ah.


  He's gone.


  Well, I guess I can be proud
 that he succeeded at something.


  Oh, it's a lot more than something.


  Homer's the biggest thing
 in food since free refills.


  (SLURPING)
  (TO "HALLELUJAH CHORUS"):
 Hey, you ate you 
  You tasted great, you 
  Hey, you ate you, hey, you ate you 
  You cooked and ate you.

 
  How did they get so
 much meat out of Homer?
  Well, they mixed in some Barney,
 Comic Book Guy and horse.


  Horse?!
  Do you know what it's
 like to have everyone
  eat of your body?
  Yeah, like, every Sunday, pal.


  (MUNCHING)
  Uh, you know,
 you don't get more of those.

  One more thing to remind me
 of my insignificance.


  [GRAMPA GROANS]
  Two adults, one student,
 one boy who just phones it in,
  and a senior citizen veteran
 on his birthday.


  Oh, and I'd like to apply
 my astronaut discount.


  I'll need to see your diaper.

  a tiny singularity of enormous mass,

  The planetarium said the universe is
  13.

8 billion years old.


  But I turned in a paper
 where I said million!
  What do you want from me?
  [SNAKE RATTLES]
  I was just wondering
  if you were planning on breaking
 into the school anytime soon.


  You know, like, maybe tonight.


  Nope.

 Not till next month.


  Please.


  I'll do your homework!
  Sounds like you can't even
 do your own homework.


  - Ouch.


 - Yeah, you think about that
  while I'm breaking you
 into the school.


  Hmm.


  MARGE: Who's breaking into the school?
  Bart's just talking in his sleep!
  MARGE: I believe that.


 Trust you.

 Good night!
  How did you know this door was broken?
  Eh, Willie keeps me posted.


  I keep him in licorice.

  Also Thanksgiving
 if there's some left over.


  Whoa! Where has this been all my life?
  Come on, let's go!
  Okay.

 You fixed your stupid paper,
  and I scored the teacher's nicotine gum.


  She does that so she doesn't
 smell like cigarettes, you know.


  Yeah, and she should also
 get some booze gum.


  [MECHANICAL BUZZING]
  What's that?
  Maybe it's the ghost of that boy
  who had to climb that rope
 in gym until his heart exploded.

  Am I that creative?
  No.

  Oh, God.


  [GASPS]
  Principal Skinner.


  Are you living in the school?
  Absolutely not.

 And you have no proof.


  [GROANS]
  Seymour, why are you
 living here? You have a house.


  With 30 pizzas on the way.


  30 pizzas.


  I can finally send mama
 back to Italy! Mwah!
  It's not my house, it's Mother's.


  But after what I just found out
 she did, I can never go back.


  They say it's better to talk
 about it, but I never will.


  - Okay.


 - We understand.


  Seriously, don't ask what it was.


  - Are you asking?
 - I was stretching.


  Then why'd you only stretch one arm?
  It's the only arm
 that needed stretching.


  Fine, I'll tell you what it was.


  - You don't have to.


 - Really, it's okay.


  We believe you.


  Ever since I was a kid,
  I-I wanted to be a drummer.


  - In a rock band?
 - No.


  Marching.


  I would've given all I had
 to be the dot on that "I.

"
  It's also called a "tittle.

"
  Don't you think I know that?
  I did everything I could
 to make that band.


  In my application, I sent
 songs and choreographies.


  [LIVELY MARCHING BAND MUSIC
 PLAYING]
  I'm a shoo-in!
  Then the fateful day came.


  Son, you got a letter from
 Ohio State University.


  I'm too nervous to get up.


  Do you want me to read it to you?
  Yes.


  I'm sorry.


  You were rejected.


  Uh, seems kind of thick.


  Well, they gave you a lot of reasons
  why you weren't good enough.


    That's so sad.


  There's more I have to tell you.


  I was going to surprise Mother
 by papering her drawers,
  then I found this.


  I was accepted.


  She lied.


  That's so sad.


  - [BART CHUCKLES]
 - What makes this really tragic
  is there was also
 a personal handwritten letter
  from the Director of Admissions.


  Dear Seymour, I truly hope
 you'll accept a full scholarship
  to come to Ohio State.


 We want to make use
  of your brillant formations immediately
  [SNIFFS] What's that smell?
  I'm making spaghetti and kick balls.


  And in a fantastic coincidence,
  our current marching band
 director is due to retire
  in four years and I can't
 of a better replacement.


  You'll live a life at the
 pinnacle of Columbus society
  and be buried at the fifty-yard line
  where you will witness coin
 tosses for all eternity.


  Does it get worse than that?
  How could it be worse than that?
  May I see the letter?
  [SCOFFS] I must say your
 sympathy is a pleasant surprise.


  No, this is just the only
 college acceptance letter
  I'll ever hold.


  Mm.


  So it's for all these reasons
 that I will not be seeking
  a seat in the U.

S.

 Senate.


  I will now take a few questions.


  Let me tell you the wonderful
 present I just got.


  Dad! What a surprise!
  [UNDER BREATH]: What's he doing here?
  Didn't we just see him yesterday?
  GRAMPA: That's what they're
 saying under their breath?
  How awful! I want to hear all of it.


  Maybe if we pretend we're tired,
 he'll go home.


  [ALL YAWNING]
  Thank God he can't hear us.


  And I'm glad these fake yawns
  are something we can do as a family.


  What?! You, too?!
  Good-bye!
  Dad, wait!
  What's wrong with the old coot?
  I mean, what's wrong with you,
 you sweet old coot?
  I got a hearing aid,
 and I heard everything you said.


  We didn't mean the mean things we meant.


  We just said them because we meant them.


  [STAMMERS ANGRILY]
  I am gone forever!
  A little mall walk will cheer me up.


  Uh-oh, old guy.

 Don't make eye contact.


  Rubbing them is like
 working dry lasagna.


  Old guy! Here he comes!
  He'll want to try all my lotion samples.


  I'll have to explain
 what "send" is on a cell phone.


  Come in! Come in!
  Well, that's more like it.


  [SCREAMS]
  [LISA GASPING, GROANING]
  I had to cheat.


  I was doing it for the bell curve.


  And with 99% of the vote in,
  the next president is Lisa Simps
  Wait a minute.


  I'm being told she cheated
 on a paper in second grade.


  She is disqualified,
  making our next president Kenny Hitler.


  No!
  Hey, welcome to Bob Hope's USO Show,
  or as I like to call it,
 Christmas away from Dolores.


  [RIM SHOT, CYMBAL CRASH]
  Oh, that could've been me
 on those drums.


  I would've gotten to rehearse
 at his house in Toluca Lake.


  Toluca Lake!
  What'll it be?
  Can an old vet have a beer
 and tell you his troubles?
  Sure.


  [NO AUDIO]
  And that's how I opened the orange.


  So, uh, [CHUCKLES] my mother
 didn't tell me I got in.


  That's all right.

 You can enroll now.


  - Can I?
 - No!
  This is a school, not an '80s comedy.


  That, uh, letter you sent me
  is that something
 you send every student?
  No, I only sent that once, to you.


  When you didn't show up,
  that was the second worst day
 of my career.


  What was the worst?
  The day the Big Ten expanded
 to 14 schools.


  What are we, morons?
  We didn't even notice till
 Northwestern pointed it out.


  Oh, I'm sorry, should I not have
 told you about the letter?
  Uh, no.


  It's actually good,
 because I'm no longer sad.


  I'm angry!
  It's time for a furious
 self-guided tour of this campus.


    I've never seen someone
 walk the oval so many times.


  He's got to be dizzy.


  I switch directions
 every other lap.


  - Oh, uh, Michigan sucks.


 - What?
  That's how we say "excuse me"
 around here.

 your astronomy papers.


  LISA: Keep calm.

 Keep calm.


  No one knows you did anything wrong.


  Lisa Simpson, come to my desk.


  [GASPS]
  Miss Hoover, I have to confess.


 I changed my paper.


  It said million,
 but I knew it was billion.


  [SOBS]: Oh, please.


  Maybe I can start a new life
 in the other second grade class.


  [SOBBING]
  I know you changed your paper.


  I don't care about your grade.


  Where the hell is my nicotine gum?
  [SNIFFLES]
  My brother had it, and he was
 hanging around the class pet.


  I'll get you some more gum.


  You do that.


    Can I help you?
  What are you doing here?
  Your mother rented me your room.


  You rented my room to the town drunk?
  I am also the state drunk.


  [BURPS]
  What do you want?
  [GASPS] You know?
  Yes.

 Yes, I do.


  Oh, son, forgive me.


  I'm so sorry.


  I just couldn't bear to lose you
 like I'd lost everything else.


  Oh, I would've arranged for you
 to live near me in the dorm.


  Oh, I can't live in a college town.


  Can't control myself sexually.


  What you did to me was the worst
 thing anyone could do to anyone,
  much less a mother to her son.


  I really don't know what you could say.


  Son, I guess when
 you get right down to it,
  I've always felt marching bands
 are a colossal waste of time.


  The music and the walking both suffer.


  You may have a point.


  And you'll always be my little tittle.


  - Is that a tear?
 - Maybe.


  [BOTH SIGH]
  Please, I beg you.


  Will you move back in?
  There are gonna have to be some changes.


  What kind of changes?
  Well, I want the parental
 controls taken off the TV.


  You'll just watch booby programs.


  If I'm in the booby mood, yes, I will.


  Welcome back, son.


  Looks like I got a little brother!
  He's not staying, is he?
  You boys work it out.


  We sure will, Ma.


  You still haven't found Grampa?
  No.

 But I found this guy
 who's willing to take his place.


  [SPANISH ACCENT]: I am Grandpapa.


  Gather the grandchildren
  that we might play
 the Hungry Hungry Hippos.


  I don't think anyone can
 replace our Grampa.


  Are you sure? Your husband
  she looked through
 hundreds of grandpapas.


  This was my third callback!

 - Yello.


  Is this the no-good ungrateful
 son of Abraham Simpson?
  - Speaking.


 - I'm gonna send him back to you,
  and I don't want to see him here again.


  This place is really depressing.


  And he does not help.


  There's a pathetic old drunk
 peeing himself in the bathroom.


  That's a mirror.


  And it's not the bathroom.


  BART: [SIGHS]
 When is Grampa gonna get here?
  GRAMPA: I knew it.


  Still bad-mouthing me behind my back.


  LISA: I can't believe it,
 but I miss him so much.


  [CONFUSED GRUNT]
  BART: I love him, too.


  I just can't say it to his
 beautiful shriveled turnip head.


  Aw.


  I love how he knows
 what every building used to be.


  And Maggie says

  [SOBBING]
  Come get your Grampa,
 you sweet slices of melon.


  - Aw.


 - [ALL SIGH]
  Aw, we love you.


    Woo-hoo!
  D'oh!
  What are you watching?
  It's a booby movie, isn't it?
  It's Emmy-winning premium cable.


  Do they show boobs?
  Not since they started winning Emmys.


  Very disappointing.


  Well, I guess I'll watch with you.


  What's that thing?
  It's a raven from
 the Lannister's Maester.


  What's a Lannister? What's a Maester?
  House Lannister is the wealthiest
  - Is that a dragon?
 - Yes.


  This is stupid.


  He walks down the street 
  He falls in a hole, man 
  Everyone knows Hans Moleman! 
  Who?
  Nobody knows Hans Moleman.


  Next.


  I was here first.


  [SCANNER BEEPS]
  In the checkout line 
  He doesn't even scan 
  Nobody knows Hans Moleman.

 
  I just need my heart pills.


  Nobody knows Hans Moleman.

     This is Kent Brockman on location
  among the good people of Springfield.


  - [KENT GROANS]
 - MAN: Coward!
  Because today, we celebrate
 beautiful Skyline Park,
  a reclamation project
 built atop the ruins
  of the Springfield Monorail.


  CROWD [CHANTING]: Monorail.


 Monorail.

 Monorail.

 Monorail.


  No, they're not building a new monorail.


  Why not? This one couldn't fail.


  [CHANTING]: Couldn't fail.


 Couldn't fail.


  [LISPING]:  It's a monstrous creation 
  Of mass transportation.

 
  [GASPS]
  RALPH: Throw me again! [GIGGLES]
  No, we're repurposing
 the old monorail track
  into a completely new
 and original feature
  we ripped off from New York:
  the Springfield Skypark-Line.


  I love this space.


  Planters, benches,
  solar-powered talking trash cans.


  AUTOMATED VOICE:
 Thank you for the used porn.


  [BUZZER SOUNDS]
  [HOMER HUMS, GRUNTS]
  Huh? [GRUNTS]
  [GRUNTS]
  Uh, okay, uh, do we go, uh,
  gut to gut or, uh, butt-butt to nut?
  Don't worry, we'll use the bypass board.


  Okay, fatsos, suck it in.


  - Oh!
 - Whoa.

 [CHUCKLES]
  [CLOTHES SQUEAKING]
  [GRUNTS]: Oh!
  [CHUCKLES] I got Homer's sandwich.


  I got Wiggum's gun.


  And now, to culminate today's events,
  let's turn on the electricity
  that illuminates
 the tiny "no smoking" signs.


  [ELECTRICITY BUZZES]
  [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING]
  Huh? Somehow the track is getting juice!
  Yes! Now to put it on power save.


  The monorail it's alive!
  I warned you not to
  [PEOPLE SCREAMING]

  [WILHELM SCREAM]
  AUTOMATED VOICE:
 Welcome, senior citizen.


  [PEOPLE SCREAMING]
  No more Nimoy!
  On the positive side,
 with this disaster,
  we have surpassed Detroit and Kabul
  as the world's most unlucky city.


  Er, ah, er.


  Couldn't you have at least put
 little wedges under the wheels?
  Er, uh, sorry, sweetheart,
 but running a city is
  a little more complicated
 than getting your nails done.


  - [ANNOYED GROAN]
 - Don't you worry
  your pretty little head about it.


  Mr.

 Mayor, that is so sexist.


  Uh-oh, sounds like
 someone's girdle is pinching.


  [LAUGHTER]
  Well, now, it's all in fun.


  No one respects you ladies more than I.


  Now if you wouldn't mind
 serving the coffee and cake,
  we men can get down to business.


  [MARGE MUTTERS]
  This is the last time I'm doing this.


  So I better do it perfectly.


  Here you go, Dr.

 Hibbert.


  -[KNIFE CHOPPING]
 -[MARGE GRUNTING]
  I can't believe Mayor Quimby
 talking down to me like that.


  And by the way, women don't
 wear girdles anymore.


  We wear Spanx and other shapewear.


  [SCOFFS] Tell me about it.


  People think we've moved on, but
 this world is as sexist as ever.


  Thanks, Obama.


  What's so great about Quimby anyway?
  I could cut a ribbon.


  And I could make it curl nicely
  using the edge of the giant scissors.


  You'd be a great mayor, Mom.


  You're organized, you manage the budget,
  and thanks to Dad, you're
 an expert on the court system.


  Fun fact: being a defendant
 gets you out of jury duty.


  [CHUCKLES]
  Mom, this is our time.


  Wonder Woman showed
 that if you're a goddess
  with superpowers, there's
 no limit to what you can do.


  You could be mayor!
  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.


  A woman prime minister, okay.


  Women Ghostbusters, cool.


  Woman head of the Federal Reserve,
  as far as I'm concerned, what's that?
  But a woman mayor?
  If Mom becomes mayor,
 we can get away with anything.


  [HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYS]
  Help me, Jesus!
  [HEAVENLY CHOIR SINGING]
  Pick a side.


  [WIND WHISTLES]
  [HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYS]
  [LAUGHS]
  Hey.

 Where'd everybody go?
  JULIO: Marge, this town
 is ready for a change.


  Quimby has been mayor, like, forever.


  You'd think he could lose that sash.


  It's like, we know, okay?
  All right now, listen.


  The key to victory is micro-targeting.


  Micro-targeting.


  Think of the voters as a pie.


  [PHONE RINGS]
  Yes, Homer, someone here said "pie.

"
  I know, "Mmm, pie.

"
  [DROOLING MOAN]
  I'm sorry, go on.


  Uh, we use data analysis
 to divide the pie
  into tiny little slivers
  and tailor a message
 to each micro-group.


  [CLEARS THROAT]
  You just tell them what they
 want to hear until you get 51%.


  Then you can govern
 like a far-right nut-job.


  MARGE [TO "OH! SUSANNA"]:
 I'm Marge Simpson 
  And won't you vote for me? 
  Whatever your obsession is 
   Is my priority.

 
  I stand with you against revenuers.


  Oh, uh, durn revenuers!
  Well, you's the new John Galt,
 aren't you?
  Hey, can you take a picture
 with our Ayn Rand scarecrow?
  [CAWING]
  CHORUS:  From widows
 to your lunch pail Joes 
  To vets of foreign wars 
  There's no single-issue voter 
   My campaign will ignore.

 
  Marge, we really appreciate this.


  You're the first politician
 that's ever met with us weirdos.


  What's the biggest issue
 you exotic pet owners face?
  Keeping our pets from eating each other.


  Yes.

 As the owner of an impala, I
  - Hey, where'd it go?
 - Oh, boy.


  From soccer moms to mafia dons 
  I'll give you what you need 
  MARGE AND CHORUS:  I'm Marge Simpson 
  And won't you vote for me? Yeah! 
  Why do people assume all I can do
  is feed spaghetti to dogs
 that want to make out?
  What do you want to do?
  Carve a little wooden boy
 and make him come to life.


  Oh.


  - [HOMER HUMMING]
 - 
    Now, for our third and fourth
 party candidates,
  I regret to say you are just shy
 of the polling results required,
  so you're excluded from the debate.


  Bye-bye.


  Mrs.

 Simpson, you've targeted
 small constituencies.


  Do you have any proposals
 that would appeal
  to every Springfielder?
  Well, Kent, I am a mom.


  And as a mom, I want to help
 this town eat its vegetables.


  [ANGRY MURMURING]
  [CHUCKLES] Vegetables, Marge?
  As moderator, it's my duty to fact check
  that many of them are yucky.


  It's a metaphor.


  Stinkin' metaphors!
  I only trust similes.


  I enjoy metaphors.


  They're raindrops on the flower
 that is the ear.


  You put in a "like" or an "as,"
  or so help me you are going down.


  HELEN: She's completely cooked.


  Unlike the chicken
 she brought to the potluck.


  LOVEJOY: Oh, Helen is
 as bitter as the lemonade
  she brought to the potluck.


  What a terrible potluck that was.


  SIDESHOW MEL: Why wasn't this
 a town hall event?
  I like to see them
 balance on the stools.


  You know, my entire life,
  that stupid tire fire has been burning.


  And it's ruined our town.


  [MURMURS OF AGREEMENT]
  I promise, if you elect me,
  I'll put that fire out.


  [EXCITED CHATTER]
  No tire fire?
  Ooh, just like Zurich.


  - Mm.


 - Mm.


  [BELL DINGING]
  FRINK [SINGSONGY]: Mm-hmm!
  Is that enough?
  And with the last senior citizen
 gently reminded
  that they cannot vote at IHOP,
 the results are now final.


  History is made.


  Marge Simpson is our new mayor.


  The first woman and the second
 to pee sitting down.


  CROWD [CHANTING]: Marge! Marge! Marge!
  Thank you.


  Homie, you want to make out
 with the mayor?
  What? No! Ew!
  Oh, you mean you.


  [BOTH LAUGHING]
  Okay.


  Now I really wish I'd voted.


  Whee! Whee!
  Look at me! I'm a public servant!
  Woo-hoo!
  KENT: And so our new mayor
 is doing what was unthinkable
  in the Quimby Regime: something.


  Roll the 'dozers!
  [CROWD CHEERING]
  [CROWD GASPS]
  Well, sorry,
  but I-I can't let you
 put me out of business.


  [CHUCKLES]
  You'd ruin the air for the whole
 town just to sell knickknacks?
  Knickknacks?
  They-they may be to you,
  but, uh, they put my son
 through med school.


  He named, um, uh, a-a stammer after me.


  [STAMMERS]
  You know.


  [CROWD AAHS]
  I failed.


  I failed on my one promise.


  [SIGHS]: Oh.


   And so, Marge Simpson
 is already a failure.


  The fastest fall from grace
 since Mamie Eisenhower
  destroyed a piano store
 on inauguration day.


    Hey, Mom, want to get some lunch?
  I'd love a lunch break,
  but I've got to get
 that tire fire out first.


  Already neglecting your family,
 Madam Mayor?
  Why you little!
 Don't embarrass your mother!
  [HOMER AND BART GRUNTING]
  [LAUGHS]
  [BOTH LAUGHING]
  Guys, guys, stop!
  I'm the mayor.


  Everything you do reflects on me.


  Of course, honey.


  It's just hard to restrain yourself
  when you're above the law.


  We're not above the law.


  Oh, yeah, yeah, I get it.


  Hmm?
   I want you to promise me.


  Can you both behave like Lisa,
 just for a little bit?
  BOTH [HIGH-PITCHED]:
 "I'm Lisa.

 I'm Lisa.

"
  "I like music.

"
  "My boyfriend is broccoli.

"
  [KISSING NOISES]
  Hey!
  We're here to buy your stand.


  Yeah, well, it's not for sale.


  [GROANS] All I want to do
 is help this city,
  and I can't because of this ding-dong.


  [CROWD GASPS]
  How dare you insult me like that?
  I was there!
  What? What, what, what, what, what?
  Clyde's a Vietnam vet,
  a survivor of the Battle of Dhing Dhong.


  Thank you.


  Than Kyu was his best friend.


  Stepped on a land mine in
 the battle of One Pun Too Many.


  This is not good, Marge.

 Not good.


  [SIGHS]: Oh.


  Marge's beehive of activity has become
  a hornet's nest of trouble.


  Also, our news broadcasts have
 been reduced to two sentences.


  Good night.


  There's only one way out.


  You're gonna have to do a live,
  completely unscripted
 heart-to-heart with the voters.


  - Here's your script.


 - I don't want a script.


  Are you nuts?
  Good evening.


  I'm here to talk to you, one-on-one,
  just an ordinary mom
 sitting in her kitchen.


  This is a disaster.


  I've seen counterclockwise
 knob turning before,
  but not like this.


  Marge, what time is dinner ready?
  I'm in the middle of a speech.


  So, 6:00?
  You'll get it when you get it.


  Wait a minute.


 Something's turning them around.


  Marge, can you cook
 a Hot Pocket in the dryer?
  [GROANS] Homer Simpson,
  the only time you shut your
 mouth is to keep food inside.


  [GASPS, STAMMERS]
  [LAUGHTER]
  That's it.


  She's turned a gaffe-making tubby
  into a laugh-yielding hubby.


  Does that work?
  FRINK [MUMBLES]: Let's see,
 the subter-hand is all right.


  The math checks out.


  I'll be the Kellyanne Conway
 of this thing.


  Kellyanne Conway?
  I like how she always
 looks like she just woke up.


  I think it's inspiring how now
 a woman can be Joseph Goebbels.


  [MURMURS OF AGREEMENT]
  Marge, do we have any bread?
  Check your chest.


  [LAUGHTER]
  Woo-hoo!
  Oh, my God.


  Those are the highest approval ratings
  I've ever seen for an incumbent: 53%!
  Marge, your numbers
 are simply fantastic.


  And all you had to do was throw
 your husband under the bus.


  Well, don't tell me you're sad
  about throwing your husband
 under the bus.


  I'm happy if he can fit under a bus.


  Zing!
  Yeah.

 [CHUCKLES] Zing.


  Mr.

 Simpson, we're naming
 a sandwich after you.


  [GASPS] My lifelong dream has come true.


  I've got this all planned.


  Start with a full Reuben
 with all the fixin's.


  Put a club sandwich on top.


  The bottom bun is, at first glance,
  a chicken-fried steak.


  But it's worth a closer look, because
  Sir, sir, sir.

 We've already made it.


  The Open-Mouthed Turkey Goofball?
  That is so not me.


  But I'll take six.


  We're honored to have
 with us the mayor
  [CROWD CHEERING]
  and First Doofus Homer Simpson.


  [LAUGHTER]
  Homer's made Marge happy more
 times than he can count: three!
  [MARGE CHUCKLES]
  And we're here for
 a very, very serious charity:
  Save the Whales.


  All right, that's it!
  No.

 That's really why we're here!
  [KRUSTY SOBS]
  I am not a whale!
  I am a man with blubber
 and several harpoon scars!
  [HOMER SCREAMS]
  [WHALE-LIKE GROANING]
  [CONCERNED GROAN]
  What a day for this town.


  We've made a deal
 with the librarians' union.


  Shh.


  Homer would've been here,
  but he backed out
 when he heard the library
  didn't have any pop-up books.


  [LAUGHTER]
  [CROWD CHEERING]
  Great news, Marge.


 You've tapped into something
  women and men can agree on:
 husbands are idiots.


  Yeah, I guess.


  While you're guessing,
 I'm running with this.


  Take a look at the balloon we've made
  for the Thanksgiving parade.


  I don't care what people say.


  My Homie makes one sexy blimp.


  I need to talk to somebody.


    Mayor Quimby?
  No, just ordinary Diamond Joe.


  Uh-oh, I know that look.


  That's a mayor on the ropes
 or a wife who wants a divorce.


  I'm familiar with both.


  Er, uh, indeed.


  Joe, is it possible to have
 a decent family life
  and be a good political leader?
  Marge, I don't want
 to talk about that anymore,
  but I'll tell you this:
 retirement agrees with me.


  The first night out of office,
  I noticed a gorgeous woman
 lying next to me,
  and I said, "Holy crap,
 I'm married to her.

"
  Go long, boys.

 [GRUNTS]
  BOTH [SEAL-LIKE BARKING]:
 Er, ah, er, ah, er, ah, er
  Marge, there's no "mayor" in marriage.


  There almost is.

 It's really close.


  But I'm afraid not.


  [GRUNTS, CHUCKLES]
  Meet you in the boathouse later?
  [CHUCKLES]
  Oh, Marge, I want to thank you
  for giving me back my Joseph.


  Will you stay?
  I just made a giant pitcher of gimlets,
  but I can make a second one
 if you're staying.


  No, I have to get back.


  We're christening a new
 manhole cover on 4th Street.


  [GULPING]
  So sad.


  Can't you stay for a bit?
  Uh, we need some help
 serving coffee and cake.


  I swear this is the last time.


  There's more where that came from!
  Thank you.

 I couldn't be here
 without my husband.


  [LAUGHTER]
  He's a big supporter.


  So big
  [LAUGHTER]
    [GROANS]
  So big, I wish all of you could
  know the love in his heart.


  [CROWD GASPS]
  Everyone, look inside yourself
  and find your Homer Simpson.


  BOTH: Mwah!
  [CROWD MURMURING]
  [GASPS] It's so beautiful.


  We make the magic happen, baby.


      Can we just skip that one?
  I would, but you have to walk through it
  to get to the cafeteria.


  Oh.

 Okay.

  that you're a little bit
 good at, I'm better.


  Okey-doke.


  Damn it!
  All right, now, listen to me.


  These stuffed suits don't stand a chance
  against us working joes.


  - Because we got
 - Moxie?
  - Eh, no.


 - Uh, grit?
  Nah, we're pretty grit-less.


  Well, what have we got?
  My stepdad is Lebanese.


  We are a damn rainbow!
  - Yay!
 - Yeah!
  We win.

 We win!
  The first out of three!
  Huh! I haven't been this confident
  since I saw La La Land win Best Picture
  and turned off my TV.


  Good win, you guys.


  Lunch is on us.


  Wow! Is that a Visa double diamond card?
  Yep.

 Doesn't have to be
 inserted or swiped.


  - It just knows.


 - Wow!
  - [ZAPPING]
 - It can sense that you're poor.


  Once again they substitute
 rhino for narwhal.


  [SCOFFS] It's like they think
 we won't notice.


  Thanks for lunch.


  And now you'll be
 eating crow for dessert.


  Uh, side note
 I have actually eaten crow.


  It is not bad.

 Tastes like seagull.


  Chang-stein, I bet you
 that I can break down
  this loser right here
 in, oh, 15 seconds.


  Moe, I would like to ask you
 about your last birthday.


  W-Why? W-What have you heard?
  Did you have a party?
  - No, sir.


 - [LISA GROANS]
  - Cake?
 - No.


  Ah, man, it looks like
 he's tearing Moe a new one.


  Well, most of his old ones
 are pretty bad,
  so that could be a good thing.


  So, did you leave your house?
  No.

 [SOBS]
  Any phone calls?
  - Y-Yes.


 - Meant for you?
  No! [SOBBING]
  I pretended to be someone
 who was interested
  in carpet cleaning.


  [WATCH CHIMING]
  Um, that's time, and he is
 definitely crying, so you win.


  Bart, you don't want
 to be with these guys.


  They're monsters.


  Hey, their 401Ks are monsters.


  Do you even know what a 401K is?
  I assume it's a gun.


  Yeah, well, I may not have much,
  but I got some things
 that matter, huh?
  My bar, my friends, my good name.


  OTHERS: Hear! Hear!
  All right, well, if you believe
 in your friends so much,
  how about we make
 a little wager on the match?
  - Uh, oh, can I bet on youse to win?
 - No.


  Careful, Moe.


 I got a bad feeling about this.


  Just leave us be, huh?
  All right, how about this?
 If we win the next two games,
  your bar is ours, and you have to change
  your, uh, good name.


  LENNY: I got a bad feeling.


  ALL [CHANTING]:
 Bad feeling, bad feeling,
  [ALL GASP]
  But if I win, I want something
 I can share with my friends.


  Something only a rich guy
 like you can give us.


  Let's do this.


  MOE: Look at me, Moe Szyslak,
 shaking hands with a guy
  wearing a shirt worth more than
 I'll earn in my entire life.


  REYNOLDS: Ugh, it feels like
 I'm shaking hands with a squid.


  No, the squid has a much firmer grip.


  REYNOLDS: Hey, Pin Gals.


  ALL: Wha?
  Hey, hey, hey, we ain't afraid
 of no bowling shirts.


  They're not shirts;
 it's compression wear,
  which increases blood flow to our arms
  and decreases wind resistance.


  Oh, yeah!
  They know two-handed bowling.


  Hey, we been hustled!
  Huh, if you can't trust hedge fund guys,
  who can you trust?
  [PINS CLATTER]
  Nice toss.


  Um, nobody likes suck-ups.


   All right? Cheeseburger.


  I want to help you stand up to them.


  But they're traders.


  All we know is
 how to collect information.


  Everyone has a weak spot.


  We will aggregate
 their emotional responses
  and run a regression through the data.


  Thanks for dumbing it down for us.


  Polish your balls?
  Man, this alley does everything.


  Oh, I don't work for the alley.


  No, indeed.


  Bart?
  Hey, Mom, I got a question for you.


  -Am I too young to start drinking vodka?
 -Yes.


  Wish you would've
 told me that an hour ago.


  Here's a little
 "don't tell Homer" money.


  If you love money with all your heart,
  the money will never love you back.


  Will having no money make me happy?
  No.


  Does Bill Gates love his wife?
  Melinda? Of course he does.


  They started a foundation
 that does wonderful things.


  - With money, right?
 - Yes.


  So, money's the answer for everything.


  Have a C-note, sweetheart.


  - She gets it.


 - Oh!
  Whew, they really kicked our butts.


  [PANTS] I'm gonna lose
 my bar and my name.


  No Moe, no tavern, nothing.


  I'm gonna jump into
 that empty elevator shaft!
  Moe, no!

  I just, uh I can't win.

  the time where I give

  a reason to get up every single day,
  and that is why I love youse, Marge.


  I mean, uh, Pin Pals.

 Pin Pals.


  [CHEERING]
  And we got a secret weapon.


  This guy is sober.


  I am, because of the love
 of your sister.


  Now, just so you know, that was,
  that was a catfish thing, right?
  What's a "catfish" thing?
  I'll explain it to you after the match.


  Just don't drink.


  You know how, uh, how Miriam hates it.


  You know, you sister looks
 just like Jennifer Lawrence.


  And all her pictures say "Getty Images.

  Yeah, that's-that's a problem
 with your computer.


  Just stay sober, huh?
  Mm-hmm.

  And I win, just like
 all good people always win.


  - McDingus.


 - Yes, Father?
  Throw this at your sister.


  You won't do it, Bart.


  Why not? It's you and it's me,
  and it wastes food.


  You won't do it because, deep down,
  there's something weird
 that connects us.


  You're crazy.


  Neither of us admits it,
  but it's there.


  I hold myself out to you.


  Go on, make my face

  I-I can't do it.

 No pressure.


  Here's a picture of my sister
  in the movie Silver Linings Playbook.


  - Take a look.

  Don't worry, Moe, I can still

  Eh, because of this idiot, Homer,
  we need three strikes from you.


  I just want to know what
 it's like to be a winner, huh?
  Just one time.


  What about that Women in Film award?
  - No, I stole that.


 - [OTHERS GASP]
  Okay, Moe, for you, I'll do it.


  We're gonna win.

 I'm not gonna
 have to start over again!
  Because starting over, uh,
 what would that even mean?
  ["LA VIE EN ROSE" PLAYING]
    [SHIP HORN BLOWS]
    That could be my reality.


  Oh, my God, I got to lose this match.


  Homer, no!
  - Give me the ball!
 - I need it to bowl!
  I don't want to win!
  You're the worst coach ever!
  - [GRUNTING]
 - Just give me the damn ball!
  [CHEERING]
  What's wrong, Moe?
  - Yeah, we won.


 - Nothing.

 I just got to go back
  to the worst thing in the world, huh?
  Being me.

 to a basketball game.


  Wha uh, d-did somebody say "wait"?

 - Well, I wouldn't come back now
  if you begged me.

 - Yeah?
  Just making a point.


  Surprise!
  You guys are my friends.


  - That's right.


 - We sure are.


  And we're gonna have a big party!
  Right after we get back
 from the basketball game.


  Eh, salt of the earth there.


  All right, guys,
 since we won the championship,
  those hedge fund do-rags
 have to deliver

 pretended to forget.


  Yes.


  And that someone is Hubert Wong.


  Happy birthday, superstar.

  Lisa, please don't ruin
 Hubert's birthday.


  You wouldn't like it
 if someone ruined yours.

  I am sorry, but if you

  I'll have to send you to the office.


  But you saying that makes me

  Mmm!
  No, Hubert.

 No cupcake for her.


    Lisa, school is a place
 for sitting quietly.


  What about learning?
  No longer part of our mandate.


  Did your mom ever disappoint you?
  This isn't about mother,
  so don't say a mother word about her.


  Don't you dare, Mother, don't you dare.


  Ah.

 It's just me, a student.


  - I can't hear you, Mother.

  She's everywhere and everyone.


  I'm everywhere because you're nothing.


  Thanks for getting me
 out of work, sweetie.

 all I have in my toolbox.


  Okay, let me think.


 What's today? Tuesday?
  Yes.


  That would make you six years

  Oh, the poor guy.


  Please let me tell him, please.


  BART: Pass the gravy.


  We used to call it "grave,"
 but that was too scary.


  So we modified it to "gravy,"
 unless it had meat chunks.


  In which case, it was "gravier,"
 but the war changed everything.


  Ugh.


  I wish you wouldn't drink
 so much in front of the kids.


  Marge, I tried to drink in the pantry,
  but you claim that's antisocial.


  Ugh.

 Why don't you just go to Moe's?
  You want me to go to a bar
 on my daughter's birthday?
  That is so messed up.

 Now!

 it's just 12 simple steps.


  Oh, 12?
  Fine.

 Nine.


  Oh!
  Okay, step one: Admit you're powerless.


  I'm powerless.

 Boom! Done.


  Step two: Admit there is a power
 greater than yourself.


  Um, if I'm powerless, isn't
 every power greater than myself?
  This is the 12 steps, not 20 questions.


  Now, make a decision
 to turn your life to God.


  [SCOFFS] God.

 He's in every
 deal, like undercoating.

 Fine.


  Make a searching
 moral inventory of yourself.


  If I have one tiny flaw, it's
 that I have many enormous flaws.


  Admit the nature of your wrongs.


  Well, I'm not the best parallel parker.


  Are you ready for God
 to remove these defects?
  Dear Lord, the Satan of Heaven,
  I order you to fix me.


  Okay, I'm just gonna
 fast-forward through this.


  - Make amends.


 - Here's your wallet.


  - Engage in prayer.


 - I pray you're not mad.


  And have a spiritual awakening.

 Till they kick me out.


  Everyone thinks
 they're not gonna make it.


  I already got kicked out
 of a psycho single
  'cause my roommate didn't like me.


  [DEEPLY]: She used all the "shampoo"!
  [CHUCKLES] I just think you're funny.


  [CHUCKLES] So I suppose
 you want to tell me your SATs.


  Very much.

 But I won't.


  Tell me about you.


  I'm already homesick.


  I was always the kid that didn't fit in.


  Middle child.


  Artsy.

 And I play
  the most unpopular instrument there is:
  the jazz clarinet.


  Hmm!
  [PLAYING LIVELY JAZZ]
  You know your way
 around a licorice stick, kid.


  You blow a mean fish hook
 yourself, sister!
  - Let's talk normal now.


 - Thank you.


  You know, today
 I was hoping I would meet
  - A lifelong friend?
 - Yes!
  Here I am.


    730 verbal, 790 math,
  800 telekinesis.


  [HIGH-PITCHED WHIRR]
  740 verbal, 780 math,
  and I speak fluent cat!
  [MEOWS]
  I have a friend!
  Oh.

 Maybe more than a friend.


  After that day, I never looked back
  except for all the time
 I just spent looking back.


  [CHUCKLES] But I never doubted
  that who I am was good enough.


  [UPBEAT SMOOTH JAZZ PLAYING]
     Light! Light!
  Sweetie, you're one year old,
  and you're already the most
 amazing thing I ever did.


  Daddy happy.


  Daddy very happy.


  Daddy euphoric!
  Aw.

 She's making up words.


  [TO ALL IN THE FAMILY THEME]:
 Boy, the way Nirvana played 
  Steroids caused a hit parade 
  Beanie Babies had it made 
  Those were the days 
  And we had real heroes then 
  Like Jar Jar Binks 
 and Qui-Gon Jinn 
  Mister, we could use a man 
  Like Richard Simmons again 
  Watching films like Gilbert Grape 
  Then rewinding all the tape 
  Gee, our modem dialed up great 
  [IMITATING MODEM DIALING UP LOUDLY]
  Those were the days 
  Very nice.

 See you in court.

 of a churchyard bell 
  I give! I give!
  I'll take you to Bart!
  He cracked like an egg 
  Please stop!
  And began to beg 
  [GROANS] You promised.


  As I sang this song-o 
  It's a song of a popinjay, 
 bravely born 
  Who turned up his noble nose 
 with scorn 
  Can you at least stab me in my ear?
  No.


  Okay, we'll split up and find Bart.


  Thanks for lending this to us, Ned.

  pray, pray, pray.

  - That's nice.

 Any sparkling?
 - Damn it!
  Hi! I'm Lisa Simpson and I'm nervous
  about saying anything that will
 ruin this perfect moment.


  My name's Brendan.


  Oh, good, good.

 No last names.


  Don't want things moving too fast.


  Oh! I hope our children get his hair.


  Now to subtly find out how old he is.


  How old are you?
  Well, I'm 11, but I'm insouciant
 at a 12th grade level,
  and I'm talented, too.


  [LAUGHS] So unfair, right?
  That's amazing, because
 the boys I know are re
  I've got sparkling!
  Sorry, I'm not thirsty anymore.


  Damn it!
  Um, so w-where do you go to school?
  I just moved here.


 I'm starting next week
  at a school called
 Springfield Elementary.


  I see it got a few
 dreadful reviews on Yelp.


  This guy called "Gary Chalmers"
 gave it half a star.


  Bloody hell!
  Of all the K through sixes
 in this world,
  you had to walk into mine.


  A beautiful hotel bar!
 Just like in The Shining!
  Oh, hi, lee tle girl.


  If you see your ma uh, ma wife,
  tell her Homer not your dad
 wants the credit card.


  I will sir.


  - Sir? I'm your dad.


 - D'oh!
  MAN [GERMAN ACCENT]:
 Today, we are performing
  an experiment that we humorously call
  "making elephant toothpaste.

"
  Boy, the Germans sure know their humor.


  Let's just hope they know
 something about chemistry.


  First, add a tablespoon of
 dish soap to hydrogen peroxide,
  then add the warm water and the yeast!
  [EXPLOSION]
  Aah! German chemistry!

  [SAXOPHONE AND PIANO

    Sounds great, Lisa.

 Really great.


  You're just a little behind the beat.


  Uh, maybe you're a little ahead?
  Aw, you're so cute when you're wrong.


  - Channel that rage!
 - No!
  Make that reed pay for my sins!
  [PLAYING LIVELY JAZZ]
  Yeah!
  - [BANGING ON WALL]
 - HOMER: Knock off that racket!
  It's not a racket!
  It's the truest American art form!
  Banging on the walls is
 the truest American art form,
  and I'm a Picasso!
  [BANGING RHYTHMICALLY TO MUSIC]
  Oh, no! They're playing in time
 to the beat of my banging!
  Well, then stop banging.


  I can't.

 The rhythm is infectious.


  [BANGING RHYTHMICALLY TO MUSIC]
      Here's the school trophy case.


   If you look closely, it's empty.


  They're actually decals on the glass.


  - Oh, hello, Lisa.


 - [GASPS]
  I see you have a new friend.


  Brendan, this is Nelson.


  Lisa, you sure know a lot of weird guys.


  Hello, Brenda.


  Excuse me.


 Why is being a girl an insult?
  Ah! So evolved!
  Lisa, are you squishy
 for this ding-dong?
  Lisa, does that fat kid like you?
  [LAUGHS] Whatever we had,
 it's in the past.


  I think there's something
 in the water in this town.


  [WHISTLES]
  [LAUGHTER]
  Oh, man.


  On a playground I tripped 
  [GIRLS SIGH]
  Then I saw you and flipped 
  He used "flipped" with a double meaning!
  Bastard!
  Now I'm skippin' 
  And trippin' for you.

 
  He turned his suffering
 into entertainment,
  just like the Jewish people!
  Nothing can ruin this moment.


  Make way.

 Dead gophers.


  Nothing!
  [LIVELY JAZZ PLAYING]
  How can you be sleeping?!
  [GRUNTING]
  Oh, thank God.


  Meanwhile, Bart's teacher says
 he has a flair for chemistry.


  Why that little
  Wait.

 Flair? Isn't that a good thing?
  Yes.

 It's too good.


  - [WHISTLING]
 - [LIQUID GURGLING]
  [GARGLING]
  Why don't you ask him what he's up to?
  Because if he lies to me,
 it's like a dagger in my heart.


  What happens when
 I mean if I ever lie to you?
  Can you find out what he's really up to?
  - I will.


 - See? That's a lie right there.


  D'oh! Okay, I really will.


  - That's also a lie.


 - D'oh!
  Fine.

 I really, really, really will.


  Finally, the truth.


  [HOMER PANTING HEAVILY]
  HOMER: Keeping promise.


  [HOMER PANTING HEAVILY]
  Stupid tree house.


  [PANTING] So far off the ground.


  [PANTING HEAVILY]
  Uh, Dad, you haven't even
 started to climb yet.


  I have to visualize it first.


  [GROANS]
  Thanks, guys.


  Ah, no problem.


  Why did we do that, Chief?
  Fat man courtesy, Lou.


  Fat man courtesy.


  Son, how do I put this?
  Are you breaking bad up here?
  No, I'm not.


  And if you're looking for meth,
 go see Cletus.


  - What?!
 - [BEEPS]
  Meth Life, proud sponsor
 of the 2020 Opioid Olympics!
  [SQUEALS]
  Ooh, that's street ready!
  Dad, I'm just trying
 to follow in your footsteps.


  You work in science,
 and I think that's really cool.


  Wow, you've never
 said that to me before.


  Do you want to go to work with me today?
  You can help me research my theory
  that the chairs can go flat.


  I'd like to, but I've got to do
 some colloidal titration.


  [HOMER WHIMPERS]
  Marge, it's worse than we thought.


  He's speaking in tongues.


  He's a religious weirdo.


  The worst thing there is.


  Cover your eyes, boys
  I'm about to flip Mr.

 Simpson
 the "Flanders finger.

"
  [GASPS] You mean
  Yup a thumbs-up
 without a friendly wink.


  [BOYS WHIMPERING]
    You have a credit card?
  Yeah, but no money.


  Oh, a true jazz musician.


            [EXCLAIMS] Just give the ice cream back.


  No way.

 It was really hard to scoop.


    [DOOR BELL TINKLES]
  Prepare to have your ears belted.


  My funny valentine 
  Sweet, comic valentine 
  Nelson?
  You make me smile 
  With my heart 
  Stop! Why are you doing this?
  I don't know.

 There's no
 good word for what I feel.


  Scared and excited at the same time.


  There is a word: vulnerable.


  "Vulner-able"?
  Yup.

 I always liked you,
  but now I'm seeing you in a new light.


  Your looks are laughable 
  Haw-haw!
  Unphotographable 
  But you're my favorite 
  [OFF-KEY]:  Work of art 
  [LOW]:  Art 
  [LOWER]:  Art 
  [WAY OFF-KEY]:  Art.

 
  Nailed it.

 [GRUNTS]
  And so now there's a jazz war over me.


  It's pretty bad.

 But it's pretty great.


  Uh-huh.

 Scotland once had two
 queens fightin' over her.


  Loser got Scotland.


   Of course, Brendan
 is the superior artist.


  But that kind of intimidates me.


  And Nelson's rough, but he's sweet.


  Plus he thinks I have dimples.


  Dimples? It's that serious?
  - [SCOTTISH ACCENT]: Aye.


 - Let me give ye advice on love.


  The Scottish national flower
 is the thistle.


  A humble weed.

 Legend has it
   that the Norse King Haakon
  staged a surprise invasion.


  But his barefooted army
 stepped on thistles,
  and their screams
 awakened the sleepy Scots.


  Many a Norwegian lass
 lamented their dead lover
  - on that glorious day.


 - SKINNER: Willie,
  someone spiked the teachers'
 vodka with sulfuric acid.


  Superintendent Chalmers
 lost the tip of his tongue.


  Kin-ner!
  [SIGHS]
  Lisa, this is a song about you.


  - A kid who's almost there.


 - [GRUMBLES]
  And when you get there,
 you'll blow the roof off.


  Oh.


    Yeah, well, I brought my washboard.


  [SCRAPING]
  Nelson.

 You took our washboard.


  I got thongs to scrub.


  I really can't believe
  that this is a choice.


  I mean, look at me.


  And look at him.


  And then look back at me.


  Hmm, they're quiet.


  Too quiet.


  [BART AND MILHOUSE LAUGH]
  Now they're loud.


  Too loud.


  [BART AND MILHOUSE CHUCKLE]
  Now they're just right.


  Too just right.


  Are you sure
 Bart's not planning anything?
  A boy takes his cues from his mother.


  If I trust him, then he'll be good.


  Hey, don't knock my mother's method
  complete abandonment from age five.


  [BART AND MILHOUSE GIGGLE]
  HOMER: Hmm.


  The school talent show.


  And on the back, chemical equations.


  Still think he's innocent?
  We'll just have to go there and see.


  You wanted rock candy,
 you got rock candy.


  Mmm.


  Brendan and Nelson are fighting.


   I'm getting Daddy's gun
 to under-arrest them.


  Oh, no.


  I'm gonna call you decrescendo,
  'cause you're goin' down.


  Nelson, that's clever.


  Thanks.

 For you, I read a book.


  All right, Ralphie, easy, easy.


  Give Daddy back his hat.


  Oh, you missed everything,
 just like Daddy.


  [SAXOPHONE PLAYING]
  Ugh, so many clams.


  Well, you're gonna look
 very nice for the show tonight.


  It doesn't matter how I look,
 I'm not ready.


  I've been so distracted by those boys.


  How did you choose Dad?
  And never regret it?
  HOMER: Marge, I might've swallowed
  a couple of your earrings.


  Gotta go.


  [MARGE HUMMING]
  I do not want to know
 how you got these back.


  So, we're really doing it.


  We're going to a talent show
  where Bart is putting on
 a chemistry demonstration.


  Have I got that right?
  If our faces get melted off today,
  I want the last thing Bart sees
  to be us believing in him.


  Fine, fine.

 Let me just finish my will.


    And [EXCLAIMS]
  Oh, it's good
 to have that taken care of.


  [ORCHESTRA WARMING UP]
   [SINGING SCALES]  Haw-haw-haw,
 haw-haw-haw, haw.

 
  Nelson? A word?
  Take five, Martin.


  I'm not even in your act.


  - I said take five.


 - [WHIMPERS]
  Ooh!
   Nelson, I cherish
 our unhealthy relationship.


  Especially the fact
 that I can tell you the truth.


  Kiddo, you're not a singer.


  Okay, fine, I won't sing.


  But I'll still perform.


  That's how much I want
 to hold your stupid hand.


  Oh.


  You're up, Nelson.


  Hello.


  I'm the school bully.


  [AUDIENCE BOOING]
  Aw, don't be a dingus.


  I'm the next Charlie Mingus.


  - [GASPS]
 - [NELSON PLAYING BASS]
  Could I really choose him?
    [GASPS] My choice is clear: Brendan.


    - [BOOING]
 - MAN: Ooh, yeah, I feel the groove.


  Next contestant, Brendan Beiderbecke.


  And Brendan wins!
  [LISPING] Not so fast.


  We have a disqualification.


  This young man does not
 live in the district.


  Right, his home is 50 feet
 into West Springfield,
  which means he will be
 transferred to a school
  three buses and a long bike ride
 away from here.


  - Brendan
 - No, Lisa.


  I can't put you through that.


  I guess this relationship is over
  until this town invests in mass transit.


  [CRIES]
  I'll never see him again.


  Lisa, I'm glad you didn't choose me.


  No woman is worth learning music.


  All this time I've been choosing jazz
  over doing my reps.


  Well, my reps never let me down.


  Lift weights, get dates.


  Lift weights, get dates.


  Well, I guess I'm alone for the moment.


  And I like it.


  - Good for Lisa.


 - She's better off alone.


  She doesn't need a man.


  Wait a minute, everybody.

 Even though
  the most interesting and
 emotionally compelling part
  is over, we still have one performer
  who says he will "blow you away.

"
  So please welcome the original
 Dennis the Chemist,
  Bart Simpson.


    Drop the beaker, Screwy Pasteur.


  [CHUCKLES]
  No.

 I wasn't doing anything bad.


  Pour the beaker and you'll see.


  We are not gonna let you
 mix those chemicals.


  We got a tip from an anonymous source
  named Seymour Skinner.


  Do you even know what "anonymous" means?
  Uh, helpful?
  [MARGE GROANS]
  Mom, I'm innocent.


  You believe me, don't you?
  Oh, if he's lying,
 I'll never forgive him.


  If he's telling the truth,
 he'll never forgive me.


  [SHORT CHUCKLE] Glad I'm not you.


  Bart, sweetie,
 I'll pour the beaker for you.


  [YELPS, WHIMPERS]
  [GRUNTING]
    ALL: Ooh!
  Ah!
  He's innocent.

 But then
 who put the sulfuric acid
  in Superintendent Chalmers' drink?
  I did.


  - Willie! Why?
 - Why?
  Because, Seymour,
 I was trying to kill you.


  [LISPING] Well, that's okay.

 Good man.


  - But
 - Quiet, Seymour.


  The man's got a dream.


  Mmm.


  I never doubted you.


  Well, you should have.


      I'm sorry.

 I'm so sorry.


  This episode was supposed
 to have been a parody
  of Moonlight, not La La Land.


  Moonlight? But none of us have seen it.


  We have the DVD.


 We could watch it tonight.


  Either that or X-Men: Apocalypse.


  ALL: X-Men!
  I'd like to see Moonlight.

  Jesus Christ Superstorm,
  But first Nostradamus: The
 man who saw the future.


  The following film, made in 1982,
  was thought to be lost forever.


  Actually, it was misplaced in a box
  for the comedy Doctor Detroit.


  But its predictions are
 more terrifying than ever.


  Hello, I'm Orson Welles,
  director of Citizen Kane
  Boring.


  as well as the lower left-hand square
  on Hollywood Squares.


  Ooh, right next to Ruth Buzzi.


  In 1555, the prophet Nostradamus
  foretold a terrifying series
 of predictions,
  all of which came to pass.


  First, his own death.

 Second,
  large wars in Europe,
 similar to the large wars
  he observed in Europe.


  And the breakup of Fleetwood Mac.


  But Nostradamus's
 final quatrain contained
  one more prediction yet to come:
  that shortly after the
 Antichrist becomes president
  A Flaming mushroom
 spreads across the sky.


  [SLURPING]
  This champagne is terrible.


  It tastes like dryer sheets.


  But what does said mushroom signify?

 I've already started the ark.

  Nothing.

 what happened on that test.


  Got a little present for you, Bart.


  It's called The Bible For The Slow.

 Mm?
  He's not going to take it.


   Okily-dokily.


  Professor Frink, your stupid
 test ruined my son's life.


  Hey, that test is like a son to me.


  I raised it from a quiz.


  I've known my son since he was born,
  and he's not anywhere near as stupid
  as your stupid test says he is.


  And if you think so,
 you're stupid, stupid, stupid!
  Wow, Marge.


  You really love Bart.


  All right, all right, let me recheck it.


  Uh, rechecking, rechecking.


  Put-upon sigh.


  [SIGHS]: Oivik.


  Rechecking ah, here we are.


  Uh, Simpson, B.


  That's not a "B.

"
  FRINK: Well, yes, it is,
 you see, the two
  oh, my garvik!
  There was a mistake.

 Well, your son
  has above-average intelligence.


  You did it, boy.


  No, that just looks like a "B.

"
  The real unfortunate is H.

 Simpson.


  [LAUGHS]: I mean, what a clod!
  Worst handwriting and brain in town.


  - D'oh!
 - BART: Hey!
  I'm H.

 Simpson.


  Oh, well, it's very nice to meet you.


  Would you like some water?
  - Smartwater?
 - No.


  - Homie, aren't you coming?
 - FRINK: Bye-bye.


  I can't.

 I'll be a laughing
 stock when everyone finds out
  I'm the stupidest man in town.


  How are they gonna find out?
  I just tweeted it.


  Marge, you have to get ahead
 of these stories.


    I'm sorry, sir, you belong here.


  Oh! Oh.


       Look thou be true.


   Do not give dalliance.


  Too much of the rein.


  [MUTTERING]
  Why does Oscar skate in his trash can?
   It makes no sense!
  [MOANS]
  I'll cheer up here.


     One "stupid," please?
  Okay, you gave me $40.


  Here's two dollars back.


  Unless you want splash insurance.


  - How much is that?
 - Another ten.


  Uh, here's $20.


  And two more for you.


  [HUMMING]
  [YELPS]
  Insurance doesn't cover
 entryway splashes.


  D'oh!
  Hey, Homer, uh, we was watching
 Jeopardy!, but, uh,
  tell you what, we'll just talk
 about shapes and colors now.


  I like blue rectangles.


  Rectangles.

 You know, Homer.


  The ones with four sides.


  Listen, you.


  I've known my shapes since I was 16!
  Put him down, Homer,
 and I'll give you a cookie.


  That's a coaster.


  Ooh! Dummy's wising up.


  I'll take the cookie.


  I never thought I'd say this,
 but I'm too depressed for Moe's.


  MOE: Heya, Homer.


  I'm sorry.

 I know I'm taking up
 too much of the bed.


  Oh, sweetie.


  What the entire world thinks
 doesn't affect how I see you.


  Well, how do you see me?
  The hair and body
 of a dashing Friar Tuck.


  Ooh.

 [MOANING]
  But what about my brains?
  My favorite character
 in The Wizard of Oz
  was always the Scarecrow.


  I knew it.

 Thanks to that test,
  you see me as stupid first
 and Homer third.


  I mean, second.


  I know second.


  I won't let you give up.


  We're going to start improving you.


  Oh, Marge.

 No one ever did
 anything useful
  after the age of 39.


  George W.

 Bush sobered up.


  And became president.


  Too huge mistakes.


  Homie, this whole mix-up happened
  because of your sloppy handwriting.


  We'll start with that,
 improving your handwriting.


  Right now, my hand just wants
 to crawl in my pocket and cry.


  Now this hand is jealous.


  Mwah.


  I know where this is going.


  Um, I do, too, but you say it first.


  Snuggling.


  [GASPS] Ooh.


  [RALPH HUMMING]
   What is his secret? What is his secret?!
  I'm going to Dizzyland.


     Want to see me do a cartwheel?
  - No! No, no, no!
 - Good point.


  On the other hand, whee! [GIGGLES]
  [TIRES SCREECH]
  Don't worry, Lou,
 I've seen that in cartoons.


  Swee'Pea, Mr.

 Magoo, they were fine.


  What about Sylvester the Cat?
  Never be a cat in a cartoon, Lou.


  Never.

  Young man, didn't I tell you

  I thought you were talking to the dog.


  We don't have a dog.


  Then what's been pooping in my bedroom?
  Professor, how on Earth did he
 get a higher score than me?
  Okay, Lisa, I am going
 to give you ten more points
  for one of the most important
 skills of all:
  discovering huge flaws in
 my test without telling anyone.


  [LAUGHS]
  You mean, after all this,
 after all I've gone through,
  you're just gonna fudge my score
 and I should be happy?
  Well, after all,
 that's how I got into, uh
  Oh, I can't say it.


  The lowest of the Ivys.


  Oh, God, help me Cornell!
  Cornell! God!
  It's okay, you're fine.


  Oh, gloyvik.


  Okay, Homie, buckle up.


  Because there's no limit to how
 neat your handwriting can get.


  Marge, I don't know.


  You can't teach an old dog new tricks.

  I'll help you.

  Homie would write me
 cursive love letters.


  HOMER: You are as beautiful
 as your sisters are hideous.


  Oh
    Oh, Homie.


  Mwah.

 Oh.


  I'm married to a writer.


  I really am.


  [SNORES]
  Welcome, all of you.


  You are the chosen people.


  Chosen to be my slaves.


  I am no one's slave.


  Well, doesn't matter what you think.


  The doors are sealed.


  Not this one.


  Wait, wait, you haven't heard
 about the retirement plan.


  There isn't one.


  Fine, I don't need them.


  I don't need anyone.


   Oh.

 Why did you have me go back
 for your slippers?
  How could you turn on me so quickly?

  To billionaire tech mogul

  - Hmph.


 - [SHUDDERS]
  [GROANS]
  [GROWLS]
  Don't take that painting, I love it!
  I won't let you take it!
      There you have it, Ms.

 Matheson,
  Joan MirÃ³'s The Poetess.


  [GASPS]
  My painting's been stolen.


  That's impossible.


  It's a mystery so baffling,
 only one man can solve it.


  Get me Manacek.


  [RINGING]
  [BANACEK THEME SONG PLAYING]
             Thank goodness you're here, Mr.

 Manacek.


  You're the best freelance
 insurance investigator
  in the business.


  Oh, well, isn't that just what we need?
  Some smug pretty boy out to
 make us cops look stupid.


  Ah, Clancy, you're looking well
  - fed.


 - Uh see?
  He put that pause between
 those two words deliberately.


  Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.


  Well, two can play at that
  pause.


  Three people bid on
 the stolen painting:
  nuclear magnate Mr.

 Burns,
  venture capitalist Megan Matheson
  and mini golf cheat Homer Simpson.


  They're all suspects.


  I don't mind telling you, Manacek:
  I hope you fall flat on your face.


  [CHUCKLING]: Oh.


  I hope not.


  My mother's rather fond of it.


  Damn your wit.


    [SIGHS] Look, Manacek, I don't
 know why you're talking to me.


  It's my painting that was stolen.


  Yes, but you insured
 a $15 million painting
  for $30 million.


  For a woman with a head
 for numbers, it doesn't add up.


  You smug son of a bitch.


  [LAUGHS]
  I like you, Manacek.


  But you should be talking
 to the real painting thief:
  the man I outbid, Montgomery Burns.


  That's quite a workout you're getting.


  Although, I can think of a better one.


  Sorry, but I'm in a
 committed relationship
  with the former Miss Denmark.


  She's created a breed of
 mosquito that cures malaria.


  Well, if she invents a cure
 for commitment, let me know.


  Pull.


  Shoot.


  Nice shot, Mr.

 Burns.


  You're a natural in the
 ancient art of skeet.


  Oh, spare me your flattery, Manacek.


  I know why you're here.


  You think I stole that
 ridiculous painting.


  Absurd.


  A little clay pigeon told me
  that you couldn't stand
 being outbid by a woman.


  Pull, pull, pull!
  Looks like the only thing
 being hit around here
  is a nerve.


  I'll blast that smile
 right off your smug face.


  [LAUGHS]
  I like you, Manacek.


  But it's obvious who took the painting.


  That lunatic who said he'd
 do anything to have it:
  Homer Simpson.


  I Did you bring that with you?
  It's inflatable.


  I got it at Brookstone.


    I don't know what help I can be
 with your case, Mr.

 Manacek.


  As you can see, I'm a very busy man.


  [IMITATING BEEPING SOUNDS]
  According to my sources Lenny
  you were obsessed with that painting.


  I myself was once obsessed
  with a suede sports jacket
 with leather pockets.


  I would have done anything to get it.


  Even steal a painting.


  Me? Obsessed with some stupid painting?
  That's absurd.


  [YELPS]
  - Is it?
 - You're right.


  I'd do anything to have that painting.


  Lie, kill, steal.

 Well, not kill.


  But I would steal it,
 and then lie about it.


  But I didn't steal it.


  And I'm not lying.


  Believe me, or I'll kill you.


  [CHUCKLES]
  I like you, Manacek.


  I'll kill you!
  [CHUCKLES]
  I like you.


  Mr.

 Simpson, there's more to your story
  than you're letting on.


  And I'm gonna find out what.


  Please don't.


  [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]
  [DOORBELL RINGS]
  Wow.


  The pizza delivery boys get
 better looking all the time.


  I'm Homer Simpson's wife.


  I love wives.

 They never
 pester you to marry them.


  Geez, you've got a lot of lines.


  You will too, after I show
 you my corduroy sheets.


  Mr.

 Manacek, my husband is a wreck.


  Please, just give me a chance
 to convince you he's innocent.


  Only if it's over dinner.


  Uh, okay.


  More Frito pie, Mr.

 Manacek?
  [SIGHS]
  Sure, why not?
  If he's not guilty of
 stealing that painting,
  why is Homer cowering on the stairs,
  eating cereal straight from the box?
  [WHIMPERING]
  Well, Homer's so quick to panic.


  It's his only flaw.


  Marge, I need you to
 be straight with me.


  Okay, I admit it, he has many flaws.


  Thousands.

 Flaws.


  Everywhere, flaws.


  Your husband doesn't really
 seem like a typical art lover,
  but he shows exquisite
 taste in the female form.


  Hey, Front Pockets,
 quit hitting on my mom.


  She only loves one stocky man
 in tight pants: our dad.


  Sorry, I can only solve
 impossible crimes
  if I'm seducing an amazing woman.


  It's my process.


  I'll tell you everything
 I know about Homer
  for one of those Tiparillos.


  No Tiparillos.


  BOTH: [SCOFFS] Women.


  [CHUCKLES]
  I like you, Manacek.


  So let me clue you in on the real story
  about my dad and that painting.


  Homer was chaperoning my class
 field trip to the art museum,
  and he was not happy about it.


  Come on, come on.

 Hurry up in there.


  Three to a urinal.


  No hand washing, or we'll
 be late for lunch.


  [GROANS]
  Hmm?
  HOMER: Sheesh, look at
 that stupid painting.


  What is it even supposed to be?
  Art should be of pretty ladies,
  hunting dogs with dead
 rabbits, Bible crap
  and 3-D sidewalk drawings
  where it looks like you could fall in.


    [WHIRRING]
  HOMER: I get it.


  I get it.


  Mr.

 Simpson, some of the
 kids went to the gift shop.


  We were only supposed
 to bring five dollars,
  but some brought more.


  Wha-Wha What?
  Oh, right.

 Chaperone.


  Hmm mmm?
  This is warm beer.


  That's an '07 Michelob.


  Homer was saving it
 for a special occasion.


  Mmm.

 Yes.


  My husband just couldn't stop
 thinking about that painting.


    [LAUGHING]
  [GIGGLES]
  [BELCHES]
  [HUMMING]
  [EXHALES]
  Wha? Honey,
  I love a painting.


  Oh, what is it of? Grapes?
  - No.


 - Flowers?
  - No.


 - Peaches?
  No.


  You sure it's a painting?
  I'm positive.

 I touched it
 when no one was looking.


  Well, there's nothing wrong
 with being an art lover
  as long as it's representational.


  Mmm
  It is representational, isn't it?
  - [GROANS]
 - Tell me it's representational.


  - [GROANS]
 - What else about our marriage is a lie?
  Are you really a licensed DJ?
  I took the courses,
 but I failed the test!
  A blue-collar Joe suddenly
 likes modern art?
  That story and two bits
 will get you a cup of coffee.


  What year do you think it is?
  Hey, who's the shamus here?
  I'm telling you, deep down,
  my dad is really sensitive.


  - [HONKS SAXOPHONE]
 - [SCREAMS]
  [PANTING]
  Oh, good, you're awake.


  You're the only one I can
 talk to about this.


  I know that painting.


  It's called The Poetess by Joan MirÃ³.


  Why does it bring me such peace?
  Why?!
  See? Even though the
 painting is abstract,
  that yellow circle can
 represent the sun.


  HOMER: Or Pac-Man at rest.


  Dad, you think art sucks.


 Snap out of it.


  HOMER: Wow.

 I mean, wow.


  Every time I look at it
 from a different angle,
  - I see something new.


 - [GROANS]
  I just want to take a moment
  to acknowledge that for the first time,
  you're dragging me into the museum.


  Yeah, it's a Topsy-turvy world.


  Beach volleyball's bigger
 than regular volleyball.


  Sorry, pally.

 Sorry, gally.


  But the museum's closed down for good.


  - [GASPS]
 - [GASPS] Can we go in and look
  at our favorite painting one last time?
  It's called The Poetess.


  Oh, it's right there, inside the crate
  that's going to the auction house,
  where a billionaire will buy it
  and you'll never see it again.


  Oh, and I'll have to take that, too.


  [HOMER WHIMPERS]
  Now museum, now you don't.


  The Springfield Museum of Fine Art
  is the latest victim of
 this city's budget woes.


  The storied institution
 has closed its doors forever.


  Its legendary art collection
 will be sold at auction
  and its docents released into the wild.


  The closure is being protested
  by a coalition of local art lovers
  and homeless bathroom users.


  [CHANTING]: Picasso, Goya,
  CÃ©zanne, DalÃ­,
   selling off artwork
   would be folly.


   [ALL CHEER]
   We're here, Vermeer, get used to it!
  People, people.

 Government is about
  making tough choices.


  This was not one of them.


  Museum attendance was near zero.


  We lost thousands on stolen audio wands.


  What do people want with wands?
  These wands
  are putting the hurt on these walnuts.


  MAN [OVER WAND]: Notice how
 Edward Hopper's use of windows
  invites the viewer into the scene
  but also keeps them at bay.


  - [WAND CHIMES]
 - [GRUNTS]
  But Mayor Quimby,
  the Springfield Museum of Fine Art,
  or SMOFA, was a jewel.


  SMOFA was the one institution
 of genuine culture
  our town could be proud of.


  Stop saying SMOFA.


  It never caught on.


  Um, excuse me, Mayor SMOFA.


  I'm not like these brainy
 tote bags over here.


  I like my crusts stuffed,
 my martial arts mixed,
  and my movies fully Sandler-ed.


  But there's this painting
 from that museum,
  and when I really look at it,
  only one word explains what I feel.


  - What is it again?
 - [WHISPERS]
  - Transgender.


 - [WHISPERS]
  Transcendent.


  Transcendence doesn't fill potholes
  or educate our children.


  Did you know we had to lay off
  a third of the police force?
  That's right.

 Eddie.


  I used to have a gun.


  [GRUNTS]
  Fine, sell the artwork.


  Let's move on to the next protest:
  too many poke restaurants.


  [CHANTING]: Poke is just okay.


  Poke is just okay.


  At Water's Edge by Paul CÃ©zanne,
  sold for $65 million.


  Yeah! I'm as happy as Steve Martin.


  It's Oh, God, no.


    Our last item is The
 Poetess by Joan MirÃ³.


  The bidding starts at $5 million.


  HOMER: I bid that.


  - What are you doing?
 - I have a plan to get the painting.


  $6 million.


  WOMAN: I think we can
 do better than that.


  I need this painting
  for my private monkey
 sanctuary in Costa Rica.


  The monkeys find the
 colors quite arousing.


  $7 million.


  - Eight million.


 - Nine million.


  Sir, we attempted to verify your funds
  at the First Bank of Moe's.


  The man at the phone
 threatened to boil our skulls
  and make them into
  [INHALES] rat toilets.


  - [GROANS]
 - It's okay, Dad.


  You just really loved that painting.


  The bidding stands at $8 million.


  - Nine million.


 - Ten million.


  11 million.


  $15 million.


  Joan MirÃ³'s The Poetess going once
  going twice sold!
  To billionaire tech mogul
 Megan Matheson.


  - Hmph.


 - [SHUDDERS]
  [GROANS]
  [GROWLS]
  Don't take that painting, I love it!
  I won't let you take it!
  Your story had everything
  a field trip, a dream
 sequence, Sideshow Mel
  and it gave your father
 the perfect motive
  TO STEAL THAT PAINTING:
  a deeper connection to his daughter.


  Well, maybe, but I'm sure he's innocent.


  Mom, Lisa, 1970s horndog,
  Dad's run off.


  He's on the lam!
  You know, once I send
 your husband to prison,
  you'll be kind of single.


  [CHUCKLES]
  MANACEK: It seems Homer
 escaped out this window.


  Hmm.


  In all my years as an investigator,
  I've never seen a trellis
 take such a pounding.


  I know it looks bad,
  but think about what we told you.


  My husband could never
 have stolen that painting.


  Hmm.

 Thank you, Marge.


  I now know exactly how
 everything happened.


  How do you know that?
  I'll be happy to explain
  over breakfast?
  [GRUMBLES] You have a
 real problem with women.


  I know.

 I'm seeing a therapist
  tonight at my place.


  Oh, get out.

 Go, go!
  [SIGHS]
  White chocolate
 the loneliest chocolate.


  MANACEK: Homer, I know you're in there.


  [GASPS] How did you find me?
  I knew you'd return to
 the scene of the crime:
  where your inner peace was stolen.


  You can't bring me in.

 You're not a cop.


  You're not even a regular
 insurance investigator.


  You're freelance.

 You don't get paid
  unless you submit an invoice.


  Which lets me control when
 my corporate year ends.


  You're always one step ahead.


  [LAUGHS]
  I don't like you, Manacek.


  Your family's story of
 how you fell in love
  with that painting did
 prove your innocence.


  - How?
 - By providing one crucial fact:
  you're too dumb to steal anything.


  Maybe I did take it.


  - Trust me, you didn't.


 - I could have.


  But I know you didn't.


 That's what I'm saying.


  - I'm smart.


 - You're dumb.


  After careful consideration
 of facts and evidence
  observed only by me,
  I can reveal who stole The Poetess:
  Ms.

 Matheson.


  [ALL GASP]
  Your last IPO was DOA,
  and you needed the cash
 to keep your girlfriend
  in hybrid mosquito larva.


  I've seen it a thousand times.


  Impossible! The armed guards
  never let the painting
 out of their sight.


  But which armed guards?
  It was a simple matter of finding
  the guards' identical twins,
  then hiring them to rob
 their own brothers.


  That's the last impossible mystery
  you'll ever solve.


  Well done, Mr.

 Manacek.


  Who would have suspected
  it was the person none of
 us had ever met before?
  Yes, it's a shame she went
 through all that trouble
  to steal a painting
  that had already been stolen
  by you.


  Uh, not yet, sir.


  I mean, how dare you
 accuse me of such a crime?
  But the painting was safely in our vault
  until it left the auction house.


  But which auction house?
  It was a simple matter
   of Burns building an
 identical auction house
  next door to the real one.


  The actual painting
 never left the vault,
  so Burns could steal it at his leisure.


  - Now?
 - Yes, sir.


  [GASPS] My painting!
  Oh, thank goodness those
 thieves didn't get you.


  It's a shame I punched out
 a woman and an old man over
  a gift shop tote bag.


  [ALL GASP]
  Lisa?
  [SIGHS] It wasn't my plan to steal it.


  That painting was the first thing
  my dad and I ever had in common.


  I couldn't bear to see him lose it.


   It was a simple matter
  of switching my canvas
 tote bag for the painting
  before it was even auctioned off.


  I knew it was wrong,
  but isn't it a worse crime
  to let some billionaire
  hide art away
  where guys like my dad
 can never fall in love with it?
  So, who gets The Poetess now?
  $10 million.


  Ownership of the painting
 reverts back to the city.


  But where will we hang it?
  We're knocking down the art museum.


  And what are you doing with
 the money Springfield got
  from selling all the public's art?
  Well, uh, we're, uh, building
  certain vitally needed
 civic improvements.


    Everything I love in one place.


  Beer.

 Hot dog.


  Bathroom.

 Painting.

 Daughter.


  Marge, you're a beautiful woman,
  but you're loyal to your husband.


  And I respect that.


  But if things were different,
 would I have a shot?
  You are the most conceited,
  chauvinistic, son of a
  [CHUCKLES] I like you, Manacek.

  The superheroes are friends
 again.

 Let's get out of here.


  We can't leave before the
 post-credits sequence.


  Why does Jeremy Renner
 need two assistants?
  Shh.

 Here comes the sequence.


  The Avengers were too
 strong for us, my Lord.


  - [BART AND LISA GASP]
 - What? Who's that?
  That's Spider-Man's Uncle Ben.


  He was alive the whole time.


  And evil.


  With great power, comes
 no responsibility.


  [EVIL LAUGH]
  Finally.


  What? You saw it.


  That was a mid-credit scene.


 There's more.


  Who the hell are you?
  I'm assembling a team of the best
  team assemblers in the world.


  And I want you to help me
 put together that team.


  Assemblers assemble!
      [GRUNTING]: Time.

 To.

 Go.


  But there's two more credit sequences.


  When I was a kid, movies
 ended when they ended.


  The only reason you
 stayed for the credits
  was to see who sang "The Power of Love.

"
  And it was usually Huey Lewis.


  I liked the first post-credit
 sequence the best.


  I liked the fifth.


  Pipe down.

 I'm trying to listen
  to preseason minor league baseball.

  of the Isotopes pitchers
  receiving Tommy John

  that's the ball game.


 Good night, everybody.


  [HORNS HONKING]
  Stupid baseball traffic.


  I'm taking a shortcut home.


  [WHOOPS]
  Kids, look.

 We used to live
 here before we were married.


  It's the old Beef Rendering District.


  Ah, yes, Tallow-town.


  At the end of every factory tour,
  they gave you a free glass of blood.


  Huh, it's really gentrified.


  Oh, a store where you grind and flavor
  your own house made toothpaste.


    Ooh.

 [SMACKS LIPS] Mmm.

 Terrible.


  [GASPS] There's our old building.

 Look.


  Our fifth floor walk-up apartment.


  [LAUGHS] Dad, you walked
 up five floors every day?
  No.

 I took the elevator
  to the top of the building next door,
  then crawled across a plank to our roof.


  Hey! I pioneered that trail!
  Yeah, great.

 Thank you, Kit Carson.


  Kids, you want to check
 out our old apartment?
  Huh? Huh?
  I can tell from your tone
 that we're going either way.


  I have one tone.


  Hi.

 You don't know me,
 but I'm Marge Simpson.


  Oh, yeah, I recognize that name.


  In fact, we still get mail for you.


  MARGE: Mm.


   Ooh.


   [LAUGHS]
   Aw.


   Oh, thank God.


  A list of 101 new choking hazards.


  [GASPS] Pacifiers?
  [MARGE GROANS]
  [GASPING]
  No! No.


  Maggie! [GROANS]
  Oh, here.


  So can I get you anything?
  Weed? Edibles?
  Pudding with a joint in the center?
  But we need you out by 7:00.


  We Airbnb this place every night
  while we stay at a cheaper Airbnb.


  Mmm.

 Disruptive.


  Before Homer and I got married,
 we had amazing times here.


  [CHUCKLES] Yeah, right.


  Like you could possibly
 ever have fun without us.


  It was a wonderful time.


  - We were living the DINK life.


 - Dink?
  - DINK: dual income, no kids.


 - Oh, DINK.


  How come you can say dink when
 you're talking about your jobs,
  but I can't say dink when
 I'm talking about my dingus.


  Before we had you, life was a breeze.


  We'd go to amusement parks without going
  on those stupid baby rides.


  Squeezing my butt into a little biplane
  that only goes four feet off the ground.


  Actually, Dad, it's supposed
 to go 12 feet off the ground.


  - D'oh!
 - It was a great life.


  We were swimming in DINKs.


  [LAUGHS]
  See? That was the key to
 their happiness no kids.


  We've been talking about
 starting a family,
  but we're just not sure we're ready.


  We can't even agree on
 what to name our ferret.


  Yeah, we both like Caitlin,
  but we just, we can't
 agree on the spelling.


  Well, we used to be just like you.


  Childless and partying every night.

  There isn't even a dartboard.


  You're Marge Bouvier?

 - Just steer clear
  of pet shelters and fun
 runs, those are my beat.


  Mr.

 Brockman, you're hurting my arm.


  Oh, I'm sorry.


  I just care about soft news so much.


  HOMER: I had a job at
 a cutting edge new company
  that would change the world.


  Homer, next week we finally
 take our revolutionary
  teeth whitening strips to market.


  I couldn't have done
 it without you, man.


  Together, we make an amazing team.


  Me, with my advanced degrees
 in medicine, chemistry
  and business, and you, with
 your gentle good humor.


  [CHUCKLES] I hear that.


  [LAUGHS]: I love it.


  It's like I know you're
 not listening to me,
  but I'm not mad at you.


  - I'm sorry, what?
 - Exactly.


  Buddy, whatever I make,
 you get a piece of.


  I hear that.

 I mean, I really hear that.


  MARGE: Homer took me to
 the hippest spots in town.


    [WHOOPING, WHISTLING]
  Oh, Homie.


  This is the happiest I've
 ever been in my life.


  Hold onto it, Marge.


  Hold on and never let go.

  Hey, some of us are trying

  No, none of us are.


  At least I died before I'm 30!
    Yes, he was 47 when he made this film.


  Did you two lovebirds-a know
  there's a meteor shower tonight?
  Homie.

 We should drive

  What about the kids?
 Oh, right, we have none.

  Why do you think?

  We'll do the next one.


  It's in 187 years.


  Where are they coming from, outer space?
  Have some num-num.


  Who likes num-num? You like num-num?
  [SIGHS] Where did this beautiful man go?
  LISA: Dad,
  I know it was fun to be young and free,
  but how could you ever replace us?
  Pool table, jukebox, and
 a vacation to Bermuda.


  Dad! Can you please get to the part
  where you reassure us
 how glad you are we're here?
  Hey, as long as I'm the
 pool table, I'm cool.


  Sweetie, I treasure you.


  - [GRUMBLES]
 - But before you kids,
  I used to know the names
 of people in bands!
  And not just the singer,
 but the guitar guy!
  And baby Bart was the worst son
 of a bitch you could imagine.


  MARGE: We were the first of
 our friends to have a baby,
  so we got lots of attention.


  - Aw.


 - Aw.


  Aw, hey, little man.

  Down low.

 Too slow.

 You won't be sorry.


  We're goin' places, Homer.


  Soon you'll be in a higher tax bracket.

 - What's that thing on your shoulder?
  Uh, my son.


  You can't have a kid.


  But I have a kid.


  A kid indicates you took time
 away from me to conceive.


  It's like a virus.

 It starts spreading,

  Working.

 Always working.


  [INHALES SHARPLY] Ooh.


  I have a difficult choice here.


  You chose me over money? [GRUNTS]
  Ooh! I deserved that.


  And that.

 Now he's worth $10 billion.


  I still have his phone number,

  He loved you before.


  You're the same guy.

  I've been expecting this call for years.


  You remember me?
  Of course.

 I've been waiting

  Are you ready?
  I sure am.


  ROSS: Good-bye
  forever.


  Oh.


   Closure is supposed to be a good thing.


  Also, I'm afraid, a newborn and
 a journalism career did not mix.


  This is terrible! I wanted
 quotes from the swing set,
  not price quotes on swing sets.


  Party pics, not potty tips.


  Glitterati, not babysitterati.


  Are you getting my drift
 or should I throw you an oar?
  It's important for new
 parents to know this stuff.


  New parents? Eh.


  They're not the audience

  All they care about are babies.


  Babies are boring.

 I'd
 rather talk about soccer.


  And I hate soccer!
  Marge, do you like bacon?
  Yes, ac

  Get me a good nightlife
 story, or I'm replacing you

  I will get the scoop.


  MARGE: So,
   you've moved into
 painting giant schnozzes.


  Marge, the mouth has had its say.


  Now it's time to find out

  That's a pull-quote,

  Pretty much everything
 I say is quotable.


  Well, not that.

  [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]
   [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]
   Hello.

 I'm Professor Thernstrom,
  author of Fractured Families
 and How to Heal Them.


  [SCOFFS] I think we all know
 who Professor Thernstrom is.


  Play the video.


  THERNSTROM: Jane was an only child.


  And science has proven
 that only children
  are lonely children
  and lonely children are evil children.


  [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]
  Jane's problems became
 the family's problems.


  [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING]
   They came to see me,
 and, nine months later,
  Joe was born, and all was well.


  ANNOUNCER: Do not undertake
 procreation alone.


  WARNING: second child
 may cause loss of money,
  limited vacations, and reduced sleep.


  Do not have a second child
 if you have heart problems,
  are pregnant, or want to
 keep your spare bedroom.


  In rare cases, sibling
 rivalry may occur.


  That's it, Homie!
  That's the answer!
  We're having another child.


  But just the one.


  We're not Catholics.


  And so we decided to have Lisa.


  That's what this was building to?
  I thought this was the story
 of how we got our furnace.


  Who would care how we got the furnace?
  I would care.


  It came with the house.


  Mystery solved!
       Finally, he's asleep.


 Let's make another.


  - Mmm, mmm.


 - No.

 Oh, not here.


  He might wake up.

 The only safe
 place is out on the fire escape.


  What if firemen need it?
   I'll be quick.


  [WHOOPS]
  Now Mother Nature does the rest.


  [ALL WHOOPING]
  Hmm

  MARGE: And so after a lot
 of late-night ice cream
  and pickles,
  Lisa was born.


  And the best part was
  Bart became the calmest
 boy in the whole world.


  HOMER: More or less.


  Why, you
  [BLISSFULLY]: you

 four months of rehab.


  Not covered by insurance.

 different kind of happy,
  but still happy.


  Wow.

 Just, uh [EXHALES] wow.


  Hey, where's your wife?
  Uh, she left me forever
 during your story.


  If you look out the window,
 you can probably see her.


  [GASPS] Oh.


  Why did you leave?!
  Because I never want to be
 stuck with people like you
  who stunt each other's growth
 with your rampant dysfunction!
  [QUIETLY]: Quick.

 Family smile.


  Our lives are great!
  We left out the happy parts
 because they were boring!
  Nothing wrong with this picture.


  [TIRES SCREECH, BRAKES HISS]
  Get over here, Lisa.


  The only way humanity survives
  is if people perpetuate this lie.


  Well, why is she frowning?
  Is there some unhappiness you're hiding?
  Um
  I'm gonna stake my whole
 marriage on what you do next!
  Smile.

 Don't be a dink.


  Mm
  I love you, Miles!
  [BRAKES HISS]
  You did it, sweetie.


  You saved two bad marriages.


  What's the first bad marriage?
  Uh, I miscounted.


  You saved one bad marriage.

 Just one.


  [GRUNTING]
  Aw, reminds me of the
 first time we hugged.


  Great story.


  Get out.


  Well, we may not be ethical,
  but we're a great team.


  Just like Fred and Ethical.


  LISA: Want to tell us
 how Maggie was born?
  HOMER: We told you that story.


  - LISA: And how we got the dog?
 - HOMER: Found him at Christmas.


  - LISA: And the origin of the cat?
 - HOMER: Nobody cares.


  This was a nice idea, Homie.

 [SIGHS]
   I'm glad we came back here.


  Just the two of us.


  - [HONKING]

  [SCOFFS] Just imagine what they'd do

  - I wish I'd never had kids.

 left in the factory.


  Never too late for another!
  No one's made it out in a half century!

  You always told me when I was wet

  in my Malibu beach house
 of thespic triumph.


  My choice for our play
 is Arthur Miller's
  Death of a Salesman.


  However, the rights cost too much,
  so we'll be doing this knockoff
 version, The Salesman's Bad Day.


  [CONFUSED MUTTERING]
  Don't worry, the text is just Play-Doh
  to be extruded through the Fun Factory
  of my Tony Award-watching genius.


  To play Willie Salesman, please
 welcome the man who's taking
  a bold leap into
 intentional unfunniness,
  and giving me a ride home tonight,
  and maybe more, hmm?
  Mr.

 Herschel Krustofsky.


  Hey-hey.

 Let me see the script.


  My line.

 My line.

 Garbage.


  Garbage.

 My line.


  [SIGHS] I don't know.


  Should I really be doing this?
  I'm an out-of-work has-been
  whose next logical step
 is to take his own life.


  And that's exactly what
 Death of a Salesman is about.


  I thought this was The
 Salesman's Bad Day.


  And that's exactly what I said.


  Anyone hear different? I thought not!
  But Krusty, the part of Willie Loman,
  I mean "Salesman," is perfect for you.


  You'll just be playing yourself.


  - Can I play someone I like?
 - No.


    I know he can't see me, but
 can he still feel my love?
  I'm afraid the glass blocks that, too.


  Oh.


  Marge, I promise I will
 make your boy whole.


  I want to believe that so much.


  I'll never forget how peaceful he was
  in those moments before he
 took his very first breath.


  Bart, you act like you
 don't have a problem,
  but deep down, you know you need help.


  No way.

 I am awesome.


  Sit down and I'll elaborate.

 [CHUCKLES]
  Um, I think I'll need some help.


  Uh, Marge, could you come in here?
  Please, take my seat.


  [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]
  We need to get to the bottom of this.


  Right to the point.


  No, no, no!
  Oh, well, maybe I should try
 a different tack.


  [DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES]
  Mom, don't sit down!
 I don't want to hurt you.


  Okay, you just completed
 step one: learning empathy.


  [GRUMBLES] Ow!
  Pop, look.


  I am losing the weight.


  Come on, Krusty!
  There's raw emotion just
 beneath your surface.


  Frack it!
  Oh, I don't know, I'm scared.


  The theater is not for cowards.


  All I ask for is integrity and honesty
  in The Salesman's Bad Day.


  Title may change.


  Now, Herschel, summon
 that talent you've hidden
  from the entire world for 60 years.


  [SOBBING]: I can't!
  [SOBBING CONTINUES]
  Hershel, my son, listen
 to me and listen good.


  You are a once-in-a-generation
 performer.


  You think so?
  No! I was faking it.


  And if I can do it, so can you.


  And now, become a great actor.


  And now, sense memory.


  - And now, be present.


 - [GROANS]
  And articulate!
  - And we breathe.


 - Oh, okay.


  And great actor.


  I'm sorry, my sons.


  Clench butt.


  I'm finished as a salesman.


  Clenchier.


  The only thing I have left
 worth anything is
  Transport me to another plane.


  my life insurance.


  But, Pop, that only
 pays off if you're
  Big pause.


  Dead.


  Your pop is gonna go out
 on his route, boys.


  One last time.


  No, Pop.

 No.


  Tell your mother I'm sorry
 about the woman in Boston!
  Also, my death is a metaphor
 for American industry!
  [CAR HORNS HONKING]
  [CRASHING]
  I'm doing it.

 I'm doing it!
  And I'll be fine, unless I get
 those voices in my head.


  You can't act.

 [LAUGHS]
  Uh-oh.


  You're a clown, and that's
 all you'll ever be.


  And when you die,
 they'll be playing this:
  - [SINGS CARNIVAL CALLIOPE MUSIC]
 - No.


  No.

 Stop it.


  - No! No! No!
 - [SINGING CONTINUES]
  Ugh.

 Ah!
  Anything wrong, Krusty?
  Only what's tormented me my entire life.


  Very good.

 See you tomorrow.


  [ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING]
   Reverend, I'm here for my last step:
  to make amends for the
 rotten things I've done.


  Oh, fine.


  Let me get into uniform.


  I'm sorry I cut all the
 Bible ribbons short
  so no one could mark their place.


  Why you son of a
  [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING]
  Willie, I'm sorry I shaved your beard.


  I've had to wear a merkin on me face.


  [GROANS]
  I also had the blades removed
 from your lawnmower.


  You've just been riding around.


  No one interferes with me mowing!
  And I'm sorry I used
 your baseball chalker
  to write "Skinner Sucks.

"
  I'll show you who su
 Wait, you can do that?
  Please don't encourage me.


  [BOTH LAUGHING]
   Thank you for encouraging me.


  Ugh, we're out of chalk.


  [LAUGHS] You know, I had
 just completed rehab.


  Well, me, too.


    America loves a lot of things,
  but I never dreamed a
 comeback was one of them.


  - Tell me, Krusty.


 - No, no.


  No more of the "K" word.


  I'm a serious actor now.


  If only my father could see me.


  Oh, I see you.

 Son, you
 used to be a putz.


  Now you're a putz trying
 to be a schmendrick,
  which makes you a schmeckle.


  Get out of my head!
  Yet another puff piece
 that ends in madness.


  I know you lost the love
 of Linda Ellerbee
  while we were launching the luge
  at the Olympics in Lillehammer.


  B-B-B-Brokaw.


    Bart Simpson cured of pranking?
   I never thought I'd see it.


  And you haven't.

 Look up there.


  Water balloons, ready to drop.


  [MILHOUSE GASPS]
  It's times like this I'm
 glad I have eyebrows.


  [BART HUMMING]
  [GASPS]
  Sweetie, I've never been prouder of you.


  I knew my little bad seed
 could bloom into a flower.


  You're proud of me?
  That's right.

 Now go give that speech
  and know that sitting in that
 audience will be your mother,
  who's always believed in you.


  Nothing can rain on my parade today.


  I I I Run!
  [AUDIENCE EXCLAIMING]
  [SCREAMING]
  Simpson!
  [LAUGHS]
  Motherhood sucks.


  [HUMMING]
  [CHUCKLES] Boys will be boys.


  [MURMURS ANGRILY]
  Ah!
  You can't come in here.


  This is the "boys will be boys" room.


  [HOMER SHRIEKS]
    Tonight, you will make
 theatrical history.


  You'll take a play that has been seen
  all over the world more
 times than man can count,
  and you will do the best version ever.


  How do I know? Because I
 just took six Valiums.


  See you outside.


  You'll never get rid of me.


  You'll always be a self-hating clown.


  [GROANS]
  When I was 17, I walked into the Amazon.


  The company, not the river.


  And when I was 21, I walked out.


  And, man, was I loaded.


  Thank you, Jeff Bezos.


  Listen to your uncle, boys.


  He's a great man.


  The audience is quiet.


 That means you're bombing.


  Quick, you got to get a laugh.


  Drop your pants, show your fanny.


  You know, your "A" material.


  Get out of my head.


  - I [GRUNTS] am [GRUNTS]
 - [AUDIENCE LAUGHING]
  a serious actor!
  [GRUNTING]
  Laughs? I'm getting laughs.


  - And not from a machine.


 - Go with it.


  I'm a salesman 
  A dying salesman 
  I'm Willie Loman 
  Just watch me go, man 
  I'm gonna suck 
  That old gas pipe 
  Pipe, pipe.

 
  [INHALES]
  Whatever doesn't kill me makes
 the play longer.

 [LAUGHS]
  [AUDIENCE CHEERS, APPLAUDS]
   This play will run forever.


  Okay, but now that I'm big again,
  I can't work Tuesdays, Thursdays,
  the month of July, or Toronto
 Raptors' home games.


  I'm the Spike Lee of that team.


  Ah, standard exemptions.

 I love it.


  He fails at everything he can 
   His sons can't stand their old man 
  It's sell, sell, sell 
  Till he dies, dies, dies 
  In a car crash.

 
  All's well that ends well.


  How did it end well?
 He's ruining my play.


  Well, don't worry.

 You've got
 plenty of other good plays.


  Oh, wait.

 You don't.


  Hey, I'm America's greatest playwright.


  Exactly.

  Hallelujah! Ah!
  We're going to spend
 family time together
  without watching TV.


  Mom is right.


  Americans watch way too much TV.


  How many hours? Let me Google that.


  Ha! Instead of T-V, I typed T-B.


  [HOOTS] Let me Google that.


  [MAGGIE SUCKS ON SCREEN]
  Turn off the devices, pronto!
  Pronto.

 Odd word.


  - Let me Google that.


 - Mm.

 Mm.


  Hey, I'm doing something educational.


  Educational, my foot.


  I saw pixels.


  It's TunnelCraft.


  A simulated world where you
 explore, mine resources,
  and work with friends to build
 replicas of real buildings.


  Can you die in it?
  - Yes.


 - It's a video game.


  I got a family activity for ya.


  In the Depression, we'd sit
 around the wood stove
  and sing songs about poverty.

  Enough!
  - I know what we're going to do.


 - Huh?
  - Ah.


 - We're going to go out.


  We're going to get some books
  and we're going to read those books.


  This is the very last chance
  for this family to get
 reading in their lives.


  So get on your feet, bubs.


  [GROANING]
  We are taking a walk.


  [MOANS]
  To the library.


  [MOANS LOUDER]
  Where you'll have to be quiet.


  [MOANS VERY QUIETLY]
  Wait, you're closing?
  You wanna read? Start with the sign.


   Oh, can't we just go
 in for five minutes?
  Up to you.


  But after 2:00, the
 silverfish take over.


  Ah!
  I just wanted to renew my card!
  Hmm.

 DVDs, plush toys, crullers
  I don't see many books.


  Yeah, the only actual books
 are coffee table books.


  Barn Doors of Topeka,
  Dogs Eating Ice Cream,
  Jigsaw Puzzles with One Piece Missing,
  Man-Killing Snakes of the Amazon
  Sir! Never say "Amazon" in a bookstore.


  Amazon! Of course!
  Alexa!
  Order books!
  ALEXA [ON PHONE]: I already did.


  Your mind is open to me.


  They'll be home before I am.


  [SNIFFLES, MOANS]
  Ma'am, if you really want to read,
  check out our proprietary e-reader:
  the Bookaccino "Niche.

  Um, excuse me.


  That device is poorly designed.


  I would register my disgust,
  but it corrects with auto praise.


  Hmm.


  Ugh!
  MARGE: Finally, a bookstore
 that sells books.


  [HOMER GRUNTS, STRAINS]
  - HOMER: Oh, oatmeal.


 - I love the smell of old books.


  [INHALES] Ah
  Wouldn't do that, miss.


  The air in here

  Let's book up and bug out.

 Memoirs of Barry Goldwater.


  [SUCKING FASTER AND FASTER]
  Lisa, look!
  The Princess in the Garden,
 by Heloise Hodgeson Burwell.


  Hmm.


  It's my very favorite book
  from when I was a girl.


  It's for ages ten and up,
  but I think you're ready.


  If you think so.


  Wait a minute.


  One bar two bars
  five bars.


  You're not reading a book.


  - You're in a Wi-Fi hotspot!
 - Dad, please.


  I'm trying to reserve
 tickets to TunnelCraft-Con.


  What? What the hell is that?
  Uh, duh, it's a convention
  for kids who play TunnelCraft.


  It's got skins, betas, mods
  exclusive access to the top devs.


  No convention.

 And that's almost final.


  But I'm dying to go, fatso.


  - Now it is final!
 - [GRUNTS]
  What do you have for a kid
  who wishes his father was dead?
  Try this.

 The Art of War,
  written 3,000 years ago
 by General Sun Tzu.


  Well, there's "war" in the
 title and very few pages.


  The only flaw is it's a book.


  Young man, are you sure you
 want war with your father?
  Mmm.

 Mm-hmm.


  I do not seek war,
  but neither do I turn away.


    If you use this book,
  your father will lie shattered
 before the gates of your palace.


  [LAUGHS]
  Oh, mighty general!
  I beg to be your unworthy footstool.


  When he sleeps, I will steal
 the jewels from his topknot.


  [CACKLES]
  Hey, Mom, I found something to read!
  Wonderful!
  What a great family day.


  And there is only one perfect way
  to complete a great family day.


  So, how's the family?
  I think they went to dinner.


 Something nice.


    [GASPS] Nelson's coming our way.


  [MOANS]
  My nose is pre-bleeding.


  I'm picking on Bart.


  You like books, huh?
  Well, here's a bookmark.


  If your enemy is easily
 enraged, irritate him.


  I heard you're not
 strong, you're just fat.


  Fat? Me?
  You try eating healthy
 at a strip club buffet!
  Oh!
  Whoa! Willy!
  - [KNOCKING ON DOOR]
 - Get me out of here!
  - [BAGPIPES PLAYING OVER EARBUDS]
 - It's on fire! Willy!
  Hmm.

 Maybe wisdom isn't
 so stupid after all.


  Milhouse, I'm gonna use this
 book to go to TunnelCraft-Con.


  Here's the book I'm reading.


  When I finish this,
  I'll have read every Mary
 Kate and Ashley book.


  Sometimes I feel like the third sister.


  [OWL HOOTING]
  Ooh.


  He opposed the religious right.


   Okay, this is my favorite book
 ever, but no pressure.


  You realize saying "no pressure"
  puts me under tremendous pressure.


  Then let's get started.


  "Not all English girls
  grow up in England.


  Clara grew up in South America
  where she was raised
 by many native servants.


  But they were too naturally
 servile to oppose her will.

"
  - Hmm.


 - LISA: "Naturally" what?
  [BRITISH ACCENT]: Uncle Juan?
  Would you clap as I dance?
  Rhythm rhythm
  [SHARPLY]: Mind the rhythm
 or you'll feel the lash!
  - [GASPS]
 - Mom, why'd you stop reading?
  It's just a little different
 than I remembered.


  Let's skip ahead.


  A father murdered by loco banana picker,
  Clara baptizing savages
 without their permission
  Oh, okay, okay, here we go.


  Clara is now an orphan
  and was sent to live with
 her lonely uncle in the hills.


  She meets a boy named Conor.


  Like all Irish, he was
 feeble-witted and drunk.


  [IRISH ACCENT]: This is the part
 you deem acceptable?
  The Irish are nobody's joke anymore.


  Hoi-dee toi-dee toi-dee toi! 
  CONOR: I'm goin' on
 a hunger strike in here!
  [MOANS] So weak.

 So weak
  - Yah-hah!
 - [SCREAMS]
  Another childhood
 classic bites the dust.


  Is that a coolie hat?
  Nighty-night!
  I bet my booklight is shining
 on something offensive.


  MARGE: Oh
   Darn it.


  Oh [GRUNTS]
  Heloise Hodgeson Burwell?
  [BRITISH ACCENT]: Why did you
 stop reading my book?
  Your daughter is just the kind
 of girl I wrote it for
  - obedient, well-fed and white.


 - Shh!
  [UPPER-CLASS BRITISH ACCENT]:
 Oh, calm yourself, Marge.


  Dreams are where it's okay to be racist.


  Rudyard Kipling!
  Yes.

 You should read my first
 draft of The Jungle Book.


  At the end, Mowgli uses his elephants
  to stomp out some Hindus
 seeking limited voting rights.


  All in good fun.


  Marge, I suppose you could edit my book
  to your daughter's sensibilities.


  Wow.

 An author that wants rewrites.


  Well, that's what makes this a dream.


  Now the war begins.


  MILHOUSE: Not yet!
  I haven't finished my costume.


  I'm doing period sewing
 with bird bones as needles.


    LENNY: Wait.


  Why do you want me to text you
  when your father's getting in the car?
    That's none of your business
 but let's just say
  both of us will benefit.


  [GASPS] A trombone mute?
  But I don't have a trombone.


  Open the other box.


  Oh, my God!

 Ralphie's birthday is today,
  and you're the entertainment.


  [HOMER GROANS]
  What's going on? It's like
 someone's out to get me.


  I have to be focused and careful.


  Nothing will break my concen
 Ooh! Wild milk ball.


  [CHOMPING]
  [GULPING]
    Bart! You're behind this?
  That's right.

 And it looks like
 someone is stuck in the mud.


  [SHRIEKS] Help me, boy!
  I will save you if you do
 what I say from now on
  starting with going to TunnelCraft-Con.


  Sure.

 Just pull me out
  by your sneaky little neck!
  [HOMER GRUNTING]
   [MOANS]
  Just be aware that if
 something happens to me,
  Mom finds out about your
 secret stash of Drake's Cakes.


  What secret stash?
  Pier 18, shipping container
 number 4-7-9-5-2.


  D'oh!
  I was offered a deal and I took it.


 Okay, I give.


  Louder, dog!
  Okay!
  [GASPING]
  Huh.

 You really think
 you can control me?
  Malted milk ball.


  Ooh!
  [PANTING HEAVILY]
 Okay.

 Here's a new version
  of The Princess in the Garden.


 [TIRED SIGH]
  - Mom, you're exhausted.


 - It takes a lot of work
  to take the spirit and
 character out of a book.


  But now it's as inoffensive
 as a Sunday in Cincinnati.


  "Once there was a cisgender
 girl named Clara.


  She lived in South America,
  fighting for wild horse rescue
  [NEIGHING]
  and net neutrality.

"
  [ELECTRICAL BUZZING]
  LISA: This new Clara
  sounds like she starts
 out pretty perfect.


  You betcha!
  But since she's already evolved,
  she doesn't really have an
 emotional journey to complete.


  - Nope.


 - Kind of means there's
  no point to the book.


  Well, what am I supposed to do?
  It's hard to say.


  Something that started decades ago
  and was applauded and inoffensive,
  is now politically incorrect.


  What can you do?
  Some things will be dealt
 with at a later date.


  If at all.


  Hey, Simpsons.

 We'll see you in church.


  Not today you won't.


  Oh.

 Well, we'll say a prayer for you.


  Don't mention my name, weirdo.


  Dear Lord, forgive that boy.


  He knows not what he says.


  [AGGRAVATED GROAN] What
 does that weirdo want now?
      [CHEERING, WHOOPING]
  Ow!
  My feet hurt.

 There's too much cosplay,
  whatever that is.


  - Can we go home?
 - Quiet, you.


  It's the two greatest
 TunnelCraft players
  of all time!
  Those guys make awesome videos
  where they play TunnelCraft together.


  Has the world gone mad?
  Their banter is legendary.


  - Got that?
 - Yeah.


  - Go left.


 - Right.


  - Left.

 Go right.


 - Right.


  - Dig.


 - Dig.


  Dig.


  - Dig.


 - Cool.


  That's why they call me Tunnel-Rat.


  - I'm Tunnel-Rat.


 - Oh, right.


  - Oh-ho
 - Oh, awesome!
  - What the?
 - Calm down.


  It's me, Daniel Radcliffe.


  This is how I see
 conventions: incognito.


  Otherwise the fans envelope me.


  Oh, that's ridiculous!
  Daniel Radcliffe!
  He knows Rupert Grint!
  Yes, I do.

 He's lovely.


  Oh! Oh, God! What are you Aah! Aah!
  I loved him.


  Please, can we go now?
  No! You wait in the poster-signing line.


  And don't sign them yourself.


  I'll know.


  Milhouse, by God,
  if you want a ride home, you
 tell me what Bart's up to.


  Okay.

 Bart's been using
  an ancient Chinese book against you.


  I knew it.

 Except for
 the ancient Chinese book part,
  I knew it!
       Why are you bringing me here?
  These professors have some
 very interesting news for you
  about Heloise Hodgeson Burwell.


  Meanwhile, I'll sit on this chair
  and imagine I'm grading papers.


  [HUMS A TUNE] Ah.


  Ah, Marge Simpson, the fan of Burwell.


  [CHUCKLES] We are all Burwelleans.


  You don't mind that her
 books are a little
  grandma on the veranda?
  Marge, Burwell's whole life was
 a protest against conformity.


  - Yeah, she never married.


 - Had no children.


  She lived in Provincetown, Mass
  a-chu-setts.


  Heloise Burwell is a lesbian icon!
  Her "offensive" stereotypes
  were actually a self-consciously
 ironic protest
  against her own oppression.


  How much of that do
 you actually believe?
  Mmm most.


  So much to take in.


  How do you deal with it all?
  With the help of sherry.


  Yes.

 Sherry, bring in
 the hard liquor, please.


  [GRUNTS, GASPS]
  Okay.

 Now you can ask me
 about Lewis Carroll.


    Remember: all warfare is deception.


  Shut up.


  I'm trying to fool my kid.


  Bart, son, if you don't mind,
 I brought a friend over.


  Mm-hmm.


  Flanders?!
  Great to be here, pal-o-mino.


  I brought some potent grass
  that'll get this party started.


 Bluegrass!
  Chicken's in the henhouse, 
 pig is in the poke 
  The whole dang farm 
 feels okily-doke 
  Goin' up to Cripple Creek, 
 swimmin' fully dressed 
  Not being naked, 
 oh, that's the best.

 
  Mr.

 Flanders.

 Again?
  No siree, Bart!
  It's me, your Homereeno!
  Morning, friend-till-the-end.


  Ready to greet the day
 with a big ho-hey?
  Call me the Pillsbury Doughboy,
 'cause I'm ready to roll!
  Then let's hi-diddley-go!
  If anyone can do it, it's we two-it!
  - Yes, indeedle, doddily
 - Okily-dokily, dokily, dokily.


  [BOTH SINGING FLANDERS GIBBERISH]
  Oh, my God.

 He's even gone left-handed.


  Now we're gonna take you
 to a movie rated R
  for "really old and boring.

 you want that balding boob
  [GASPS] Ooh, I said "boob"!

  If you truly surrender,

  Now, come here, son,

  You're playing an instrument.


  Mom, music is made by computers,

  Look, your mom thinks
 that forcing you to do music

  You ungrateful punk.


  You're not worthy to walk

  How could you go so long
 without seeing your own father?
  Seriously, how'd you do it?
 It sounds amazing.


  Yeah, well, let me explain.


  You know how the world
 sees me as a a

 - Bingo.


  Well, I'm the white sheep of my family.


  They're involved
 in a very evil business.


  - Illegal drugs?
 - No, worse.


  - Prescription drugs?
 - Oh, well, not that bad.


  The Szyslaks are mattress salesmen.


  - [BOTH GASP]
 - Eh, I know, I know.


  They're like mortgage brokers
 without the moral code.


  Charging people 1,200 bucks
  for what's essentially a big bag of hay.


  [HUMMING]
  Growing up, it was me, my dad
 and my brother and sister.


  We were the biggest
 mattress chain in town,
  mainly thanks to our local TV ads.


  [GRUNTS] How does it?
  There it is.


  [FANFARE PLAYING]
  Here ye, hear ye!
  I declare the best deals
 in all the land!
  AND DON'T YE FORGET: no credit
  No problem!
  So come on down to Mattress King,
  at any one of our many
 convenient locations.


  We'll have you sleeping
 on a new mattress
  - to

  - And cut.


 - Great work, kids.


  Everyone gets an onion.


  MOE: But there was another
 reason for our success,
  as I was about to learn.


  Son, your voice is finally
 gravelly enough
  for you to learn what it takes
 to survive in the sleep biz.


  Bedbugs?!
  These are Hungarian mattress gnashers.


  The only way to get rid of them
  is to walk away from your house
 naked and start a new life.


  [CHUCKLES]
  Y-You're gonna sabotage our rivals?
  No, no, no, no, no, no.

 You are.


  You want to be a sandman,
 a slumber jack, a yawn jockey?
  This is what it takes.


 It's the Szyslak way.


  MOE: They were the competition, sure,
  but they were a family, too.


  I couldn't ruin them.


  You should be proud.


 You did a good deed.


  Yeah, well, that good deed
 ruin't my life.


  That family I took pity on,
  they doused our mattresses with bedbugs.


  The Szyslak empire was ruin't.


  Soon, we were down
 to just a few locations.


  My pops never said
 how disappointed he was,
  but he let me know in his own way,
  by kicking me out and turning my room
  into a home gym he never used.


  My brother and sister took
 my place in my father's heart.


  The only connection I had
 with Pops was LinkedIn.


  [GASPS] That's worse than nothing.


  Why do you think your dad
 reached around to you
  after all these years?
  I don't care.

 I don't care so much!
  Moe, you will never have peace
  until you make up with your father.


  HONEY, I NEED YOU TO HEAR THIS:
  sticking your nose in Moe's
 horrible life will end badly.


  Homer, what's your favorite movie?
  Fast &amp; Furious 6.


  And what's the theme of that movie?
  Cars.


  What's the other theme?
  [GASPS] Family.


  She's right, Moe.


  You got to give your cars
 a second chance.


  BART AND LISA: Is that
 your family's mattress store?
  - MOE: No.


 - Is that your family's mattress store?
  - No.


 - Is that your family's mattress store?
  No!
  Geez, I never noticed
  how many mattress stores there are.


  Yeah, you never do
 till you're shopping for one.


  Then they're freakin' everywhere.


  That mattress looked perfectly
 fine when it was delivered.


  It's not my fault you flipped it over!
  Mr.

 Szyslak, I've brought someone here
  who still cares for you.


  Um, hey there, Pops.


  I'm, uh, I'm sorry about
 shoe-slapping your face and all.


  Well, maybe I had it coming.


  You hittin' that?
  - Can I, uh, say I am?
 - Mm-mm.


  That must be Moe's brother and sister.


  They don't look ugly like Moe,
 but I'm still feeling the ugly.


  Ugh.

 That one's eating
 Chinese food with scissors.


  [LISA, HOMER AND BART SHUDDER]
  Hey, what's Ugly Do-Right doing here?
  He ain't no mattress man.


  I will never forgive you for
 what you made Dad did to you.


  Oh, so we're doing the "what
 I done made Dad did" thing?
  Because I can did this all day long!
  Shut up, you box springs!
  I'm the one what reached around
 to this cesspool of disappointment.


  - You know, to make amends.


 - Amends?!
  - Amends?!
 - Amends?!
  There's no reason
 for this to come to shoes!
  I want you all to come to our house
  for a family forgiveness dinner.


  We'll be there.


  Can I bring a bottle of something?
  That would be lovely.


  You want oxy or Demerol?
  MARGE: Okay, the brother here,
  the father there, Moe here
  No.

 No good.


  You know, when this all ends horribly,
  it's gonna be pretty hard
 not to say "I told you so.

"
  Just don't say it.


  You've never been married,
 have you, Lisa?
  When you love someone very much,
  the toughest thing
 is not to rub their face
  in their horrible screw-ups.


  [MARGE GROANING WORRIEDLY]
  So, okay, here's a fun game.


  Everyone take turns
 saying something nice
  about a person they're related to.


  I'll start.

 Lisa has lovely penmanship.


  Thank you, Mom.


  Me? Uh, well, it's
  admirable how my stupid father
 reached around to this traitor!
  I'm impressed that you better shut up
  and make nice with the traitor!

 - Dinner fight!

  Like all mental disorders,
 the yips are likely incurable.


  Oh, for God sake.


  The yips.

 I have the yips!
  Bart, what happened to your pupils?
  They're Annie'd, okay?
  MARGE: Lisa, you want to play some more?
  No!
  [SIGHS]
  [LISA CRYING]
  Lisa, honey, are you okay?
  You barely touched your green disgustos.


  Some nights, there's isn't
 enough kale in the world
  to brighten a girl's mood.


  [LAUGHS] Oh, that's a good one!
  - Don't you dare.


 - Okay.


  I have some news.


  My great half step-aunt Eunice Bouvier
  is turning 100 years old,
 and she wants us there.


  Is this the aunt who lives in Florida?
  It's not just Florida.

 It's Gainesville!
  I only have two weeks vacation,
  and I have to spend 'em in Dullsville?
  Gainesville.

 If we have time,
  we'll take a day trip to Dullsville.


  HOMER, LISA AND BART: Oh!
  It's my turn to pick the vacation!
  Also, she loves music,
  so I'm sure she'd like
 Lisa to play for her.


  Stop it!
  Fine.

 The Simpsons are going to
  Oh, I can't say it.


  Gainesville.


  I was born in Gainesville, Florida 
   And my father was a tailor 
  And my mother ran a cafe 
   Near the university.

 
  MALE PILOT [OVER P.

A.

]: Uh, takeoff is
  the most perilous phase of air travel.


  If you're gonna crash,
 that's when it happens.


  Wait.

 Am I on mic?
  FEMALE PILOT: Yes, Frank.


  Uh, folks, you were just listening
  to a new play I wrote
 Death at 600 Feet.


  Yeah.


  I don't think that's making it better.


  Well, thank you for the
 note, Scott Rudin.


  I'm sorry to announce
 that all our TVs are out.


  PASSENGERS [GROANING]: Oh!
  But you're welcome to read
 our in-flight magazine,
  featuring an interview with
 our CEO Hanuki Atanawa.


  PASSENGERS [LOUDER]: Oh!
  Maybe we'll have one of
 those passenger riots
  that seem to occur every
 other day on U.

S.

 airlines.


  [WOMAN GRUNTING, PANTING]
  - Could I get another seat?
 - No, absolutely not!
  You chose an economy modest ticket.


  Please! They're both farting!
  All it would take is a single spark
  to set this powder keg off.


  [PASSENGERS GRUNTING]
  - [CLAMORING]
 - [BOTTLES CLINKING]
  PASSENGERS [CHANTING]: Hey, hey, TWA!
  How many flights did you cancel today?!
  Hey, hey, TWA!
  MALE PILOT [OVER P.

A.

]: Folks,
 I'm afraid due to turbulence
  among the passengers, we are
 gonna have to land immediately.


  Looks like we will not
 be going to Gainesville.


  [PASSENGERS CHEERING]
  MALE PILOT: [CHUCKLES]
 It is pretty great, isn't it?
  Our new destination is, uh let's see.


  - New Orleans!
 - [PASSENGERS CHEERING]
  It's a miracle! Everyone wins!
  [CLOCK TICKING]
   Happy birthday to me 
  Happy birthday to me 
  [CLOCK CONTINUES TICKING]
  [BAND PLAYING LIVELY JAZZ MUSIC]
   Look, Lisa! Isn't that nice?
  The sign's telling you to celebrate!
  What are you celebrating?
  Humidity at a 98%.


  Don't they sound great?
  Yep.

 More musicians better than me.


  Oh, boy.


  You're good at cheering her up.


 I'll take Bart.


  Whoop-de-do.


  HOMER: Hmm.

 [CHUCKLES]
  Well, I appreciate you choosing me, Dad,
  but I don't know how much fun I'll be.


  I think I can cheer my princess up.


  - I don't think you can.


 - Oh, I think I can.


  I'm a pretty tough nut.


  Well, if you're a nut,
 I will crack you up.


  Not with puns, I'm afraid.


  - Yes, I can.


 - No, really.


  - You like puns.


 - No, I don't.


  I said cheer up!
  That kind of scares me.


  - Scary "eek" or scary "ha ha"?
 - Why would you say that?
  There is no scary "ha ha.

"
  - Yes, there is.


 - No, there isn't.


  - What about scary clowns?
 - Nobody likes scary clowns!
  - Go to your room!
 - I'm in New Orleans!
  That's your answer to everything!
  HOMER: Did you know that a man
 can fall in love with a city?
  It happens slowly at first.


  Then when you develop a crush,
  you find your love just grows and grows.


  If you like, you can take
 that drink on the street.


  [GASPS] Even Bourbon Street?
  [LIVELY JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING]
  [GASPS]
  Oh, I'm out.


  Enjoy.


  HOMER: And then you discover
 a thousand little things
  you love about the city.

  [SIGHS LOUDLY] Yeah.


  Okay, sweetie, Daddy's in love.


  So now we'll deal with your sadness.


  Okay.

 It's good to see you happy, Dad.


  [RETCHES] Hold that thought.


  Uh, my good boy, is there a vomitorium?
  This town is famous for five vomitoria:
  the elegant Creole Vomitorium,
  the Blues Vomitorium,
  the traditional Heritage Vomitorium,
  the Upchuck Mangione Museum,
  and the bucket over at Chartres Street.


  Alert them all.


  Would you like to look at historic homes
  in the Garden District?
  "Historic"? "Homes"?
  "Garden"? "District"?
  Which of those words do
 you think appeals to me?
  Okay.

 We could talk about your hat.


  It has a lot of history, too.


  - Did you know that it
 - [GROANS]
  All right, wise guy.

 Here's
 something you'll like.


  Cool.

 I always read better
  when the letters are
 dripping like blood.


  Bart, you go in there, and
 I'll pray for you in here.


    Please, Lord, please.


  I need to finish this, okay?
  All day, you had.


  Please, Lord.

 We're a
 family on a budget.


  We just need a little relief
 from our demons, please.


  Hmm.


  Where are we?
  I smell Pringles.


  [GROANS] You'll pay.


  You'll all pay!
  - Mom, will you pay for this?
 - [GROANS]: Oh.


  Now, sweetie, let's find
 a restaurant for you.


  I don't think my problem can be solved
   by crawfish and jambalaya.


  I wonder, do they have
 jazz in New Orleans?
  Okay, Lisa, look at
 your hero for an hour.


  I'm gonna take a whiz
 in the cemetery next door.


  [HUMS A TUNE]
  Okay, who to choose? Who to choose?
  Ooh, Etienne de BorÃ©.


  I wish you could talk.


  [GRUNTS EXCITEDLY]
  Man, I have been waiting
 for someone to make that wish.


  What's on your mind?
  My music teacher says
  there'll always be
 someone better than me.


  [CHUCKLES] Well, that's not the only way
  to be part of jazz.


  Well, I could be a jazz
 critic or a music executive.


  Jazz critic? Music executive?
  They're nothing but
 glorified grave robbers.


  Look what I found in one of the graves.


  - Put that back!
 - [HOMER GROANS]
  Lisa, darling, you just keep searching.


  You can find anything you
 want in New Orleans.


  Except, apparently, statue
 polish and pigeon poison.


  Thank you.

 And may I ask you,
 how are things in heaven?
  You know that thing
 we used to call reefer
  and you people now call medicine?
  I do.


  Well, they have it up in heaven,
 and it is mighty fine.


  Mighty fine!
  [LAUGHS]
  So, any last advice?
  Your father knows best.


  Let's go to a bar.


  - But
 - Daddy's right.


  Can I sing you out?
  Anything but "What a
 Wonderful World" please.


  Can you sing "What a Wonderful World"?
  What a horrible world.


  HOMER: Okay, I moved her
 from crying to glum.


  Now to shoot for happy.


  I just pray they don't
 see through her fake I.

D.


  MAN: Hmm.


  Well, it's better than his.


  Uh-huh.


  [BART LAUGHS]
  Milhouse, anything yet?
  No effect.


  But how's Lisa dealing
 with her depression?
  Oh, give up on Lisa.

 Wait for Maggie.


  Oh, I don't
  Wait! Maggie likes me?
  Still not working.


  What's not working?
  Uh, Bart's got voodoo
 dolls of all you guys.


  [SCOFFS] There's no
 voodoo in Gainesville.


  Their flight got diverted
 to New Orleans.


  [ALL WHIMPER]
  [GRUNTS] You hackeyed the wrong sack!
  [ALL GRUNTING]
  It's working!
  So, has Maggie said anything about me?
  We have a lot in common.

 Same bedtime.


  We both like clapping.


  Ow! Ow! Ow!
  Come on, we've got to
 go meet your father.


  Let's go.


   Well, there's no miracle for me here.


  [CRIES] Why?
  Don't worry, sweetie.


 No one can see you.


  You're alone in the dark, anonymous.


  - Spotlight?!
 - What?!
  Lisa, would you do us the honor
 of joining us onstage?
  How do you know me?
  That man is my uncle.


  [GASPS] Bleeding Gums Murphy?
  - We called him Oscar.


 - Oscar! Oh.


  Oscar Gums Murphy.


  You still play bari sax?
  I wish I could play for you,
 Bleeding Gums' nephew,
  but I have the yips.


  Oh, that's too bad.


  Well, could you hold this
 while I play clarinet?
  Now, could you give the
 mouthpiece a little kiss?
  I think I see through your simple plan.


  My uncle said you were the most
 promising young musician
  - he'd ever met.


 - He did?
  [SCOFFS] It was kind of an insult to me,
  but he was pretty passive-aggressive.


  So, are you gonna play?
  Yes! I want to jam!
  I want to scat! I want to riff!
  I want to get down! Oh!
  [PLAYING LIVELY JAZZ MUSIC]
  [CROWD CHEERING]
  She's playing.

 You did it, Homie!
  Marge, I just realized,
 we've helped everyone else,
  but we haven't done anything for you.


  A mother's happy as long as
 all her children are happy.


  Another one, sir?
  No, that's not my Uh, yeah.


  Uh, this one straight up.


  Aw.


  [SAXOPHONE PLAYING JAZZ MUSIC]
  HOMER: Lisa, knock off that racket!
  LISA: Oh, how I've missed this.


  [GASPS] Mr.

 Armstrong!
  - Why does a ghost sweat?
 - I don't know.


  But I would give anything
 for a new shirt.


  [BOTH LAUGH]
  I'd also really like to be alive again.

  LENNY, CARL AND BARNEY: 27 28
  Okay, Homer, this is
 the last pickled egg.


  Keep it down and you win 50 bucks.


  Okay.

 If I win, we're
 going out for omelets.


  Yeah! I am the champion
 of this very bad idea.


  Uh-oh.


  He's gonna blow.


  Hey, Moe, you're not gonna
 serve those eggs, are you?
  No, no.

 I, uh, I find
 another use for them.


    Hmm.


  I was 50 bucks up until I blew
 every egg out of my belly.


  Oh!
  Whoa! Hey, there, pal.


  I'm afraid that was the
 mayor's favorite light pole.


  You give me the car,
  I give you 500 bucks and I
 make all of this go away.


  Uh, this is awkward.


  You don't have to thank me.


  Ugh!
  Marge.


  When you start a sentence with "Marge,"
  it's really bad.


  Marge, Marge, Marge.


  I sold our car.


  - What are you gonna drive?
 - Your car.


  Oh.

 Well, then I guess
 I'll be riding the bus.


  That's right.

 Like rock
 stars and Rosa Parks.


  Now just wait till you see
 what's become of our car.


  Feast your eyes on this.


    Why are you showing me this?
  I don't get it.


  And I'm crying.


  Lousy wrong channel.


    The Legends of Demolition
 Derby-Derby-Derby
  are coming to Springfield-
 Springfield-Springfield!
  So shut up!
  And get your ass-ass-ass
  over-over-over here-here-here!
  Proceeds go
  to stuttering-stuttering-stuttering.


  Wait for it.

 Wait for it.


  We've got all the
 Demolition Derby greats!
  Vince "Dead Tooth" McGee!
  James "Psychiatric Disorder" Porter.


  "Meth" MacFarland.


  Mysterious Fandango
  and a very drunk Billy Joel.


  I'm sorry, but most of these
 names mean nothing to me.


  Here it comes!
  And making his triumphant return
  to the Crash Zone after a
 full skull transplant,
  Gene "No Helmet" Dupree!
  Eh? My car in a demolition derby!
  And we got primo tickets
 for Saturday night.


  Look at them fan.


  Wait, wait, wait.


  This is the point where
 Lisa always ruins it.


  No, I'm good with it.


  People get out their aggression
  and destroy carbon-burning cars.


  See? Ruined it.


  And then I noticed
  there wasn't any more cinnamon
 on top of my rice pudding.


  And I said, "Where's the cinnamon?"
  And they said, "There never
 was any cinnamon, Abe.

"
  Fine, Dad, we'll get you some cinnamon!
  I can't tolerate cinnamon!
  So, I started asking
 everyone in the TV room
  if they remembered the cinnamon
  and the answer will surprise you.


  The results were incon
  When did you get that put in?
  Worth every penny.


  But how many pennies is that?
  Homer Simpson, you can't just
  Hmm.


  All right, young'uns.


  You know that movie Cars that you likes?
  Uh-huh.


  Well, all your favorite characters
  is gonna commit suicide here today.


  - Huh?
 - What?
    Ladies and gentlemen,
  please silence all cell phones
  and holster all truck nuts.


  And now, in conformance with the
 latest paleontological theories
  about dinosaurs, please welcome
 the all-new Truckasaurus Two.


  I love you, Steven Spielberg.


  Now, a brief moment in memory
  of those we lost in the past week.


  And now
  let the bash-'em-ups begin!
  If I get hit by a brain, can I keep it?
  Be sure to get it signed afterwards.


  There's our car!
  Wow.

 Without Dad's weight
 in it, it really moves.


  Oh, my God, this is it.


  Only one car stands in our way.


  It's down to Homer's Boner
  and Car-rak Obama, the
 Affordable Healthcare Mobile,
  which you can't kill no
 matter how hard you try.


  My whole life has been
 leading to this one moment.


  Oh! My chest hurts!
  That's called pride.


  My arm is numb!
  Numb with pride.


  Son, I need to go to the hospital.


  Huh?
  Sure, Dad.


  I missed it.


  Can you see the pain you're causing him?
  Go on, git!
  I'm sorry to say it,
 uh, doesn't look good.


  Homer, your father would like
 to see you, uh, one last time.


  I hope you've got a return
 receipt on that balloon.


  I always do.


  Homer, there's something
 I need to tell you.


  I'll give you two a moment
 in this, uh, semiprivate room.


  Where is the nurse with my
  Son, I did a terrible
 thing many years ago
  and I need you to forgive me before
  before it's too late.


  Anything, Dad.


  Uh-huh.


  Uh-huh.


  You already said that part.


  Remember, you can't tell anyone.


  It's awful!
  I swear.

 Now get to the point.


  You didn't!
  Okay.


  I forgive you.


  Your conscience is the one
 clean thing in this room.


  Well, we tried everything we could
  and the last thing worked.


  How did you save him?
  When a body is in too much pain,
  the brain releases a hormone
 to bring a merciful death.


  But an expensive new drug
 blocks that and keeps him alive.


  What a glorious day!
  I'm gonna live
  and my son has forgiven me
 for the worst thing I ever did.


  Yes.

 Forgiven.


  Sir, you just destroyed
 a box of hospital cotton balls.


  - That's $75,000.


 - D'oh!
  Now I want to watch
 my favorite new show,
  currently in its 17th season.


  It looks like another murder
 at Jackson Island Naval Base.


  That's what makes America great.


  Prompt investigation of
 in-house naval crimes.


  Homie, look who's here.


  Yeah, I see.


  Oh, Homer, are you a Sunday puzzle?
  'Cause you sure seem down and a'cross.


  My dad did something to
 me I can never forgive.


  No worse than what God did to his son
  and they wrote a book together.


  Bye.


  He tricked me with his code
 blue and his flatlining.


  And I fell for it like a sap.


  What did he do?
  I promised him not to
 say what he told me,
  but I will never look at
 him the same way again.


  Yeah, but you forgave me, so
 that means you have to love me.


  Nyeah, nyeah, nyeah, nyeah, nyeah.


  Marjorie, I'm sorry,
  but I do not want to be in
 the same room with this man.


  I'm going to Moe's.


  Then I'm going to Moe's!
  Then I'm staying here.


  A gun and a sailor hat.


  Nothing screams naval
 crime more than that.


  I'm going to Moe's.


  I hate seeing a father and a son
  sit at opposite ends of the bar
  'cause it means I got to walk more.


  Now come on, youse guys.


 Bury the ol' hatchet.


  Hey, life is short.


  You could be killed by a drunk driver,
  die of cirrhosis,
 stabbed in a bar fight.


  All kinds of random bad things
 happen to my customers.


  All right, look, here's 50 cents, huh?
  Play the jukebox and the love tester.


  You heard Ray Charles.


  Actually, in my jukebox, we
 can't afford no Ray Charles.


  It's a white guy named, uh, Charles Ray.


  Excellent vision, excellent vision.


  Dad, Grampa, the place we're
 going is the perfect way
  to make you guys friends again.


  I went there for Janey's
 last birthday party.


  You think you can solve our problems
  at a kids' birthday party place?
  It's cheaper than therapy
 and it comes with cake.


  If cake solved problems, Homer
 would have a Nobel Peace Prize.


  That's a bullcrap prize.


  They gave it to Kissinger.


    Welcome to the Escape Zone.


  The latest attempt to get
 people to save a dying mall.


  Now, would you like to be buried alive?
   Done it for real.


  How about Medieval Dungeon?
  Got to be less torture
 than listening to him.

 Hey.


  Thank you.


  Okay, you two are trapped in a dungeon.


  The only way out is to solve
 ten puzzles by working together.


  Yeah, whatever.


  Super!
  They're just sitting there.


  I bet they'd hurry if they
 knew we had balloons.


  They're moving.


   Son, if you take this sword and
 stick it in that magic portal,
  I think it might open
 a bookcase somewhere.


  Yes, that makes perfect
 sense.

 I'll just
  Homer? You're not getting out
 to say good-bye to your dad?
  He's probably afraid we'll see how much
  the car lifts when he gets out.


  No, I'm not.


  There's only one way to
 make you guys understand.


  I'll tell you what Grampa told me.


  That was in confidence.


  And in this family, we keep
 our promises.

 Starting now.


  I am telling.


  Oh, God.

 Oh, God.

 I hate conflict.


  - Then just leave your body.


 - Okay.


  Hey!
  When I was growing up,
 my dad loved to make
  model World War II airplanes.


  Watch it, son.

 You're
 gonna break the wing.


  Oh, now you got glue up your nose.


  Oh! Don't eat the decal.


 How many have you had?
  Just leave me be.


  Oh!
  I work hard all week at
 the model plane factory,
  and this hobby is my one escape.


  Can you please watch
 this little monster?
  When he gave me to her,
  it was the best thing he could've done.


  - This is the dough.


 - Dough.


  Yes, dough.

 Now, I need someone
 very strong to roll this out.


    Love you.


  She loved me.


   And for each pie she made,
 she wrote down the recipe
  and put a special note
 to me on the back.


  We don't know what life will bring,
  so on your birthday or
 any day you need it,
  you'll know that your mother loved you
  and have reasons to love yourself.


  You just taught me food is love.


  I like myself.


  That lunch box
  was the most valuable
 possession I ever had.


  When she left,
  those recipes were all
 I had left of her.


  And that's the end.

 What a sweet story.


  And there's some things
 that shouldn't be gone into
  until a man is dead and can't be kicked.


  After she ran away,
 my father was furious
  and did something terrible.


  He threw my recipes off a cliff.


  Everything that reminded him of her.


  He lied to me.


  He told me she took the recipes
 with her when she left.


  Are you sure, Daddy?
  Yes.

 And don't ask me again
 till I'm on my deathbed.


  Wait.

 Why are you looking like that?
  If this man had had those notes,
  his life would've been different.


  He would've had confidence.


  He would've had his mother with him!
  I would've had hair!
  Homie, that's not very realistic.


  And I would've been more realistic.


  - Grampa, so thoughtless.


 - Mean old man.


  His slippers don't even
 have bottoms anymore.


  I never thought I'd say this
 word, but here it comes: coot.


  Homer, why are you smiling?
  We're finally hating
 together as a family.


  What do you say we all go
 to that home and yell at Grampa?
  Oh, that would be lovely.


  Now enjoy this sweet song of hate.


  If I could save hate in a bottle 
  The first thing that I'd like to do 
  Is to hate every day 
  Till eternity passes away 
  Then end with a giant screw you 
  But there never seems 
 to be enough time 
  To hate the things you want to hate 
  Once you hate them.

 
  - Lousy Grampa.


 - So heartless.


  Always calls me "buddy" or "fella.

"
  Don't forget he's hard of hearing.


  Lousy Grampa!
  So heartless!
  What you did was crap, Grampa!
  - I want to yell at him first.


 - I want to yell at him first.


  Hey, has anyone considered
 the silent treatment?
  The silent treatment doesn't work.


  It doesn't work.


  It does not work.


  Okay, fine, it works.


  It works so well.


  Please say something.


  How long has it been? Three months?
  I don't even remember
 a time before this.


  Where's Grampa?
  - He hasn't touched his lunch.


 - Or his lunch meds.


  "My beloved family" Oh, boy.


  "I've learned an important lesson,
  never get things off your chest.


  Which reminds me of a gal
 named Chesty Lazar.


  She ran a speakeasy on Hawaii
 right before Pearl Harbor.


  Pearl Harbor was the name of the lady
  who bought the joint"
  Digression digression
  Crazy talk Ah, here's the end.


  The point is,
  confessing don't really
 make you feel better,
  'cause it don't redo
 the bad thing you did.


  So I'm gonna undo what I done
 if it's the last thing I do.


  Hmm.

 Mm.


   Oh, no.

 He's heading for that
 cliff to look for those recipes.


  I'm gonna find him, save him,
  and tell him I can't wait till he dies.


  Leave me alone.

 I'm gonna find it.


  Don't do it, Dad! Most is forgiven!
  Wait, what's your rope tied to?
  - Hmm?
 - Hmm?
  Oh, my God.


  Please be okay.

 Please be okay.


  Oh
  Hmm?
  Don't worry, son.


  This will give you all
 the rope you need.


  Dad, no! I love you.

 Mom
 left, but you were there.


  Cranky, a little drunk,
 sometimes not there,
  but you were always there.


  Oh.

 You love me.


  That's all I need to hear.


  Good thing I also threw out
 your mother's bed when she left.


  I can still smell her perfume.


  And I've got the recipes back.


  Huh?
  Oh.

 They're gone, just like Mom.


  - I'm sorry, son.


 - It's okay, Dad.


  Life doesn't always
 give you neat endings
  that tie everything up in a bow.


    Mmm.

 This pie is fantastic.


  It's what I imagine eating
 great jazz would be like.


  Always with the jazz.


  It tastes exactly like
 my mom used to make.


  Exactly!
  Excuse me, how the hell
 did you get this recipe?
  It was a miracle, actually.


  33 years ago, this place
 wasn't doing well,
  possibly due to our
 location under a cliff.


  I went out to contemplate my fate
  when suddenly, like a gift
 from God, the recipes came.


  I'd never seen such recipes,
  such brilliant fruit combinations
  and such beautiful messages on the back.


  Those messages were for me.


  Well, then you should have them.


  Everything tied up in a bow.


    What's it say?
  It says, uh
  "Your father is an okay guy.

"
  - Aw, thanks for telling me.


 - Thanks for buying it.


  Mr.

 Simpson, based on your budget,
  I am afraid there's only one car
 on this lot you can afford.


  You know this car?
  Do I!
  Aw, I thought that's where you were.


  Geez, what's wrong with her?
      


                





                    			1
  [EXCLAIMING]
  - Worth it.


 - Totally worth it.


  Again!
    MARGE: Dinnertime!
  Dad, are you gonna watch
 the solar eclipse?
  Sorry, but this is pork chop night.


    OTHERS: Ooh!
  LISA: Ah!
  Way to go, God!
  Huh?
  [SHOUTING]
  Aah! My eyes!
  I told you to use the cardboard box!
  I thought you meant for standing on.


  Marge, you gonna eat that
 piece of burnt gristle?
  - No.


 - Whoo-hoo!
  - [CHEWING NOISILY]
 - Homer!
  Did you pour fry pan grease
 into the milk carton?
  - Yes, but it's not for
 - Just a splash for my coffee.


  [GROANS] I wanted to watch
 the eclipse with you.


  I can only imagine what
 you've got planned
  for date night tomorrow.


  Date night?! Marge, if
 we're still dating,
  why in the world do we have these kids?
  - What? [GROANS]
 - Hmm?
  Hey!
  You need to make me feel
 you're as smitten with me
  as you were when we met.


  Marge, darling, you mean as much to me
  as the sun and the moon.


  There was an eclipse of
 the sun by the moon,
  and you didn't even walk outside.


  Come on, Marge, you can't be that mad.


  - [GRUMBLING]
 - Uh-oh.


  [GROANS] Marge wants a
 date night this Saturday.


  You think you've got problems?
  I'm really not liking this new bar mix.


  This Saturday? Is she crazy?
  That's when we spray
 nitrous in the ant farm
  and watch 'em go nuts.


  Yeah, here's a taste.


  Stupid ants.


  Maybe I could have a date night here.


  Sure.

 I'll make it nice.


  Take the paint cans out
 of the ladies' room,
  just like the Waldorf Hysteria there.


  I don't know what to do.


 I want it to be perfect.


  I've spent so long ignoring
 how she thinks and feels.


  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 It's a
 real crotch-22 there.


  You know, Moe, a lot of what
 you think you're saying,
  you're not really saying.


  Well, I got to admit, I've been doing
  a little of this nitrous
 myself.

 [CHUCKLES]
  [INHALES]
  Oh.

 [CHUCKLES]
  [SLURRING]: Stupid ants.


  [CACKLES]
    My funny valentine 
  Sweet comic valentine 
  You make me smile 
  With my heart 
  Your looks are laughable.

 
  Aw.


  You didn't have to do that.


  That and much, much more.


  - 
 - Huh?
  - 
 - Huh? [LAUGHS]
  Corkage fee.

 $30 dollars?
  Corkage is the sum we charge
  for opening the wine you bring, sir.


  30 bucks to open a box?!
  I mean, nothing's too
 good for this lady.


  - Play the violin.


 - I am just a waiter, sir.


  I said play the violin.


  [PLAYING OFF-KEY]
  [PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC]
    [LAUGHS] After dinner drinks.


  I feel like Mrs.

 Remington Steele.


  Con te partiro 
  Paesi che non ho mai 
  [BOTH MOANING]
  [GRAMPA SNORING]
  I want you.

 I want you!
  And I want you.

 Only you.


  Oh.


  Ooh.


  [MOANS]: Oh.


  What the?
  [KNOCK ON DOOR]
  - [KNOCKING CONTINUES]
 - [HOMER GRUNTING]
  Oh.

 Sweetie, I-I think you'd
 better see who it is.


  - [SIGHS]
 - Homer, I know it's late and
  you've got your "Keep
 Out, Flanders" sign up,
  but, uh, I'm sorry, I-I [SOBS]
  [SNIFFLES] I'm feeling mighty low, sir.


  - MARGE: Who is it, Homie?
 - It's stupid no one.


  Flanders? What's wrong?
  Marge, it's date night!
  That's a made-up thing.


  FLANDERS: Mmm-mmm.


  Lukewarm water.

 If I close my eyes,
  I can pretend I'm at the dentist.


  [SLURPS, SIGHS]
  Afterwards, I'll grab
 some Flintstone vitamins
  and try to knock myself out.


  Half a Bamm-Bamm should do it.


  Ned, what happened?
  [SIGHS] I'm out of work.


  The Leftorium is no-morium.


  Hey, Ned.

 I can't hack it anymore.


  You want to buy my side of the kiosk?
  I'll get all the people
 coming out of Sears!
  But I got squat.


    People are getting all their
 southpaw sundries online.


  All I was getting were
 right-handed college students
  who wanted to experiment.


  Don't worry, Ned.


  Homer will tell you how to
 get a job at the plant.


  - I will?
 - Yes, you will.


  - Because it's date night.


 - You said that wasn't a thing.


  - Let's not fight on date night.


 - Oh, all right.


  Call the plant and ask
 for Human Resources.


  [CHUCKLES]: Oh, thank you.


  And as a reward, you
 get my famous cocoa.


  Now, I assume the two
 of you will want a cup?
  [SIGHS] Make my next one a double.


  - 
 - [MUSIC PLAYING THROUGHOUT]
  I cannot be your head of Human Resources
  one more second, okay?
  With the verbal abuse
 and the physical abuse,
  and the lying under oath.


  And especially this!
  Would you like to be the new
 head of Human Resources?
  To quote my pet turtle, "Shell yes!"
  Not so fast.


  You may have to give me
 blood from time to time.


  Yes, sir.

 My blood's like my attitude:
  - B-positive.


 - Excellent.


  Isn't this great? We're
 carpooling to work.


  So I can see you in
 the morning, at work,
  in the evening, and in my dreams,
  thanking you for saving my life.


  Look, Ned, we're just driving together.


  I don't want any "iddlies," "diddlies,"
  "neighborinos" or "oopsy-doopsies.

"
  - Okily-dokily.


 - Here's another suggestion:
  no talk, just music.


  Oh, sure.

 That's why I brought
 this CD of Christian favorites,
  Magical Ministry Tour.


  [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
  Pray, pray, heart and soul 
  Stick another dime in
 the poor box, baby.

 
  - Maybe we should talk.


 - [MUSIC STOPS]
  Well, of course, my friend.


  - Want to talk about Jesus?
 - No.


  - Want to talk about Ecclesiastes?
 - No.


  - Want to talk about baby Jesus?
 - [MUSIC RESUMES]
  Pray, pray, heart and soul 
  Stick another dime and
 I'll pray with thee.

 
  Let's crank it up to six.


  [CROW CAWS]
  - 
 - BURNS: You'll notice on your paycheck,
  we've adjusted for desk rental
 and electrical power usage.


  [CHUCKLES] Isn't this a power plant?
  As defined by the IRS,
 we are a religion.


  And that is the last
 question you'll ask of me.


  I will break you in one day.


  - 
 - Now we're gonna do a little role-playing
  with Smitty and Jacqueline.


  Smitty, pretend you're greeting her.


  Uh, have a good one.


  Okay, stop right there.


 A good one, what?
  An unspecified object is
 the devil's wordplay,
  so I say, "Come and
 go with a hidely-ho!"
  What a wuss.


  I can hear you.


  Did you help this wuss get this job?
  I just told him who to call.


  And you didn't put in a good word?
  - No.


 - You idiot.


  A recommendation from you
 would've sunk him for sure.


  Okay, what happens if I touch her?
  Mm.

 Go ahead.


  Hey, good work today.


  This hardly seems fair!
  Your behavior is
 obnoxious and offensive.


  You'll be working for me
 in a different capacity.


  - 
 - Hmm.


  [VIDEO GAME SOUND EFFECTS]
  - What are you doing, Lisa?
 - Making an art project.


  - You color very neatly.


 - Thank you.


  Pride's a sin.


  [GROANS] So is snitching to God, Rod.


  I'm Todd.

 I think.


  [CROW CAWS]
  [SNORING]
  Homer.

 Homer.


  Hey, hey! [SHOUTING GROGGILY]
  Homer, you were sleeping at work.


  I had to mop up your drool.


  HOMER: Leave me alone.


  To beef up team spirit,
 I thought I'd form
  a little prayer circle at lunch.


  Um, if you pray at lunch,
  aren't you interrupting God's lunch?
  Finally, someone thinks about God.


  [TODD HUMMING]
  Um, Todd, do you have
 anything else you can do?
  - Can I pray for you?
 - Ugh.

 If you do it silently.


  [QUIETLY]: Dear Lord, let Lisa avoid
  [LOUDER]: the cleansing fire foretold by
  the Council of Nicaea
 before they got leprosy!
  - That's not silently!
 - You have such great hearing.


  [GROANS] I miss Milhouse.


  I knew if I switched from
 white to dark socks,
  things would start happening.


  Uh, you wanted to see me?
  [SIGHS] I happen to know
 your father didn't die.


  Look, Ned, you have to learn the
 way things work around here.


  People cut corners.

 You
 have to let things slide.


  Let me repeat.


  Sorry, Homer, I can't cut you any slack.


  I owe it to you to help you
 achieve your potential.


  Maybe you could help get me
 another job at the plant.


  One where you don't have to
 show up, like safety inspector.


  But you are the safety inspector.


  Then I should really return these things
  that have fallen down my back.


  They look like gummy
 worms, but they're not.


  I can't take it.

 I can't take it!
  Why can't he be like our
 neighbor on the other side
  who we never see?
  What's the matter, Homie?
  [SOBBING]: Oh, no.

 No.

 No.


  [DOOR CREAKS]
  Eh?
  Oh, Lord, it's Homer Simpson.


  I forget.

 Are you seven
 hours ahead or behind?
  Whatever.

 I really need
 your help with Flanders.


  Could you please get him fired?
  I feel you.

 Thanks.


  Oh, I reached him.


  So, looking through the records,
  I discovered this company has
 never given anything to charity.


  In fact, it looks as if
  we've actually taken
 money from charities.


  Ned, would you mind
  if I brought a few associates
 into this meeting?
  [CHUCKLES]: Well, no.


  - [DOGS BARKING]
 - [FLANDERS SCREAMS]
  - You're fired!
 - Nice boy, nice boy!
  You're welcome to keep any radiation
  that seeped into your bones.


  Speaking of charity, call
 the orphanage, Smithers.


  We have some leaks in our pipes
  and need tiny hands to plug them.


  Uh, they said they wouldn't
 send you any children, sir.


  [SCOFFS] They have to say that.


  I want to thank you, Homer.


 You've been a true blue friend.


  Can we talk about something fun?
  I now weigh more than Fat Elvis.


  Well, I know I got one
 advantage you don't.


  I got Homer Simpson in my corner.


  Um, Ned, I have a confession to make.


  Now don't go turning Catholic on me.


  I can't.

 I don't fit in those booths.


  Ah, don't worry about me.


  I'm sure there's a job out there
 for a Bob Jones University grad
  who majored in teaching
 and casting out demons
  and who speaks fluent Aramaic.


  [TIRES SCREECH]
  - [GASPS]
 - [DOG GROWLING]
  Hmm.

 Wish Mr.

 Burns didn't
 send these home with you.


    A word to the wise: don't be cocky.


  Don't say you can lifeguard
 if you can't swim.


  [CHUCKLES] It'll come up, believe me.


  - 
 -  
  - 
 - One, two, three.

 One, two, three.


  Make sure you keep at least
 five Bibles between you.


  Oh, don't got crazy, Patrick Swayze.


  Time to put Baby in the corner.


  [SCREAMS]
    Mm-mm, mm-mm.

 You can't pose for
 your cover photo like that.


  Much better.


  [SCREAMS]
    [SIGHS]
  [TIRES SCREECH]
  [FLANDERS GROANS]
  Ned, would you like to say grace?
  [CLEARS THROAT] Heavenly Father,
  thank you for the blessing of
 being tested, losing my wife,
  losing my second wife, losing four jobs,
  and losing $23 at blackjack to Bart.


  23 chips, so $2,300.


  - I'll finish grace at home.


 - Can you do that?
  Yes, I can do that!
  Oh, God, now the apologies
 are gonna start.


  I apologize for my tone of voice,
  and for the things I said.


  And now, as penance,
  I will get that skunk
 out of your birdhouse.


  I don't care what you say, Marge.


 We got to help him!
  I want to help him.


  Good, good.

 The ice
 queen begins to thaw.


  Oh, Lord, give me a sign
 you're still with me.


  Mm.

 Poor Ned.


  It really helps to eat your feelings.


  I've got it! I know what job Ned can do!
  Well, go tell him.

 He goes
 to bed in five minutes.


  Ned, Ned! You should be what Jesus was!
  - A carpenter?
 - No.


  - Fisherman?
 - No.


  - Foot washer?
 - No.


  - Wine creator?
 - No.


  - Water walker?
 - No.


  - Superstar?
 - No.


  - Dashboard ornament?
 - No! A teacher.


  I think you should be a teacher.


  Like Jesus.


  Lord, should I do it?
    And you shall receive it.


  He's looking right at us,
 and he's not doing a thing!
  Duffman hates Duffmankind!
  Oh, yeah!
  Up in the morning and out to school 
  The teacher is teaching
 the golden rule 
  - 
 -  American history and practical math 
  You studying hard 
  I promised I wouldn't cry
 on his first day of school.


  - [SNIFFLES]
 - Let's play the frozen game.


  [BOTH GRUNT]
    So, rub-a-dub-dub, 30
 kids and their sub.


  Let's be friends, shall we?
  KIDS [CHANTING]: Teacher,
 teacher, you must quit.


  You can't teach us math or lit.


  There's no mercy in the bunch.


  We will make you leave by lunch.


  Martin Prince? Were you in on that poem?
  Oh, they paid me.

 A gig's a gig.


  Well, sir, I'm not scared off.


  I got two little wild things at home.


  Now, who can name the state capitals?
  - A dingus.


 - [LAUGHTER]
  Well, in that case, I'm the
 biggest dingus in the world.


  [LAUGHTER]
    Okay, then, let's give Mr.


 Flanders a room 4F salute.


  [KIDS CLAMORING]
  Simpson, take the kill shot.


  Why me?
  - Prove your loyalty.


 - My loyalty to what?
  To peer pressure.


  Bart Simpson, I know you
  we've been fishing together,
 we've gone to church together
  and if you can fire that spit wad
 after our long relationship,
  I don't deserve to be a teacher.


  Aah!
  [GROANS]: Oh.


  [SCHOOL BELL RINGS]
  Last lesson, kids.


  "F" is for foolish and
 failure and Flanders.


  You win.


    Yes?
  Look, what is your deal? Do you like me?
  Do you want to be like me?
  Lisa, I have something to show you.


  - What?
 - I made you a little house.


  There's me praying.

 There's
 you at the computer.


  I made you a saxophone
 out of dried macaroni,
  and the crackers on the
 roof they're solar panels.


  Todd, I had you all wrong.


  You're a wonderful kid, and
 I'm happy to call you my pal.


  So glad I have a friend.

 I'm
 really sick of my brother.


  Okay, that's enough.


  What's the matter, Homer?
  [SIGHS] I think I ruined Flanders' life.


  - BART: Join the club.


 - What are you doing here?
  I come here for a G&amp;T
 gumball and talk.


  Here you go, pal.


  Listen, you've got to
 apologize to Flanders.


  Why don't you apologize to Flanders?
  You're the one who prayed
 for him to get fired.


  What? He should apologize
 to me, because he
  well, he he makes me
 feel so damn guilty!
  All right, I'll apologize, too.


  What's she doing here?
  Hello.

 She's my designated driver.


    [KNOCK ON DOOR]
  Hey, fellas.

 What brings you here?
  We came to say we're sorry,
  and we want you to go back to teaching.


  Oh, with all I've been through,
  I've never questioned
 my faith until now.


  You spit-wadded my moustache, boy.


  I think you could be a great teacher.


  Almost as good as her.


  [SNIFFLES] Thank you, son.


    Remember, if you can
 teach one kid one thing,
  then today will be a success.


  She never gave up.


  - Neither will I.


 - Great.


  Now, this counts as a
 parent-teacher conference
  and a Christmas concert.


  Well, that's all well and good,
  but I got to get those
 kids to respect me.


  Do people respect God?
 No, they fear him.


  It's never personal, just business.


  [THUNDER RUMBLING]
  Just leave everything to me.


  - [SCHOOL BELL RINGS]
 - [WILLIE HUMMING]
  [KIDS CLAMORING]
  Listen up, children.

 If
 you push hard enough
  on the pudding skin, there's a
 tough cup of vanilla beneath.


  - Now take your seats.


 - How you gonna make us?
  [BART HUMS]
  I won't.

 The good Lord will.


  - 
 - [KIDS EXCLAIMING]
  Haw Huh?
  [WHIMPERS]
  The scariest thing is we
 don't have a class skeleton!
  [SCREAMS]
  Truly, God is the biggest
 bully of them all.


  KIDS: Amen.


  Now, Nelson, I'm not
 gonna ask you to stand
  and read me a list of state capitals,
  but the good Lord might be pleased.


  Albany, Annapolis, Atlanta,
 Augusta, Austin, Baton Rouge
  [SCHOOL BELL RINGS]
  Does the Lord hear the bell up there?
  Yes, son, he does.


  [EXCITED CHATTER]
  Thank you, Bart.

 I knew deep within you,
  there was a good boy, and
 I respectfully request
  that those be the last
 two pranks you pull.


  You know it, man.


    FLANDERS: Wow, they're quiet.


  I'm reaching them.

 Edna was right.


  MILHOUSE: Hmm.

 Does
 that cute school nurse
  know that I'm alive?
  Because last time I left her
 office, I was legally dead.


  SHERRI: I have to beat
 Terri to a training bra.


  BART: I wonder how much
 I can sell Maggie for.


  HAMSTER: I'm starting to think
 this wheel doesn't go anywhere.

 [SHOUTS]
  [PRINTERS WHIRRING]
  - Mmm.

 Jam.


 - [PRINTER BEEPING]
   [YAWNS, LAUGHS]
  [FOOTSTEP SPLASHES]
  Okay, okay.


  The only explanation
 is I'm still asleep,
  dreaming that the house is flooded.


  What does it mean? What does it mean?
  It probably means you're
 under a lot of stress
  because this is not a dream
 and the house is flooded.


  - D'oh!
 - Cowabunga!
  [MARGE HUMMING]
  [GASPS]
  MARGE: Oh, my God.

 This is horrible!
  Although, I do like the sofa better
  where the water's carrying it.


  How did this happen?
  Homie, I don't like
 where the painting is.


  Maybe you're upset about something else.


  Are you hungry?
  Why don't you make some pork chops?
  Fine.


  Now can you hang the painting?
  Always with the painting.


  MARGE: Perfect.

 Wait, no, no, it's not.


  Try again.


  Mm.

 No, split the difference.


  See?
  When you listen to me,
 we make a great team.


  It's almost like I can hear the ocean.


  I guess we're both at fault.


  In a way, that's refreshing.


  Do you want me to apologize anyway?
  - I'd be happy to.


 - Aw, no, thanks, sweetie.


  HOMER: Hmm.

 Well, either way, I'm sorry.


  Okay, now, when we try
 to sell the house,
  no one mention the water.


  Just tell me you paid the insurance.


  You mean that bill that's
 floating right there?
  [LAUGHS] It's not due
 till tomorrow, so relax.


  My origami project.


  Don't worry, sweetie.

 We'll
 have a funeral for it.


  GIL: All right.


   I-I'll just pull up your policy.


 Alt-Control-F Aw, damn it!
  Kate! Kate, can you get in here?
  It's a different generation that
 knows how to work these things.


  - Enjoy.


 - Eh, the kids, huh?
  They just know how to do it.


 Now let's see here.


  [MURMURS QUIETLY]
  You're in luck! The policy I sold you
  covers the full replacement
 value of your house.


  [HOMER WHOOPS]
  We also pay for six months
 temporary housing.


  Now the bad news: your policy
 is the only one I've sold.


  It just cost the company a bundle,
  and I'm gonna lose my job.


  Gee, sorry, ol' Gil.


  That's okay, I got options:
 unemployment, suicide.


  When one door closes, a coffin opens.


  Eh, what am I saying?
 I don't make coffin money.


  But now I got something to work towards!
  That's right.


  Kate, can you tell me
 how to charge a cell phone?
  Whoa, whoa, whoa, so wall
 holes make things charge?
  [LAUGHS] What's next?
  There are some nice Airbnb
 options on the Westside.


  Ooh.

 Huh? Huh?
   Mm, I'd feel kind of weird
  sleeping in the bedroom
 of someone I know.


  Everything okay with the room?
  [SHOUTS] You're not supposed to be back
  from your vacation for three weeks.


  It's not a vacation.


  My dad is doing seasonal fruit picking.


  Come on, Milhouse.


  I need you on my shoulders
 to reach the high apples.


  And I don't want to be in a room
  where guys walked around
 with their dinguses out.


  No! No, don't imagine that!
  So, son, uh, word on the street
 is you've come into some money.


  Yeah?
  I was wondering, you know, uh
 just hear me out
  I've always considered
 you a friend, and
  Oh, no.

 No, no, no, no, no, no.


  This is the most precious
 kind of money there is:
  unearned, and it's mine.


  And you're not getting at it
 just because you need
  a bigger TV or a room
 with a window or
  An operation.


  You need an operation?
 What's the matter?
  If it's all the same, it's embarrassing,
  and I'd rather not discuss it publicly.


  Really? What could it be?
  Look, it's important to me and pricey.


  What could it be?
    "Pane in the ass"?
  [BUZZING]
  [IMITATES BUZZER] Hands off!
  I need professional help!
  Not to worry.

 This is the United States.


  We have the third best
 health care system
  in North America.


  Hi, Medicare!
  I mean, hi, every-money.


  Can I speak with the doctor alone?
  Of course.


  Oh, wait, I'm the doctor.


  That's why I wear the
 heart listening tube.


  Ba-boom, ba-boom.


  That never gets old.


  What's taking Grampa so long in there?
  It's crazy that medical
 costs are so high here.


  In Denmark to pick a country
 at random health care is free.


  Free? Honey, nothing
 is free but Splendas.


  In Denmark, they make
 everyone pay high taxes.


  Even rich people.


  Yes, and they get free health care.


  It's called socialism.


  Socialism? But all my radio
 loudmouths tell me to hate that.


  That doc can't do nothing for me.


  You know, if Grampa was in
 Denmark and he had an accident,
  he'd get medical care for free!
  I can't go to Denmark by myself.


  I get lost in the middle of a sentence,
  and that was the best pie I ever had.


  Wait a minute.

 What if we
 used our insurance money
  to take a family trip to Denmark?
  Why would we want to go to Denmark?
  It is the happiest country
 on Earth, in poll after poll.


  I got your poll right here.


  Hey, you're right.


   Homer, you've got the vacation coming.


  We've got the money.

 It's settled.


  We're going to Denmark,
 and Grampa will get fixed.


  Well, Homer, looks like Marge
 is the boss in your house.


  Well, I say we don't go!
  But we need to go.

 I'm desperate!
  Fine, we'll go.


  [LAUGHS] That woman's got
 you right under her thumb.


    DANISH MAN: None of these were chosen
  as the name of our airline.

 Danish Air.


  Excuse me, sir, the "no smoking"
 sign has been illuminated.


  [ELECTRONIC CHIMING]
  Sorry.


  The flight attendants are so sweet.


  We will be landing in
 Copenhagen shortly.


  If you have been designing
 and building furniture
  during the flight, please apply
 your final coat of varnish now.


  Hey, I got things done, too.


  GRAMPA: What the?!
   SOREN: Denmark, the jewel of the Baltic.


  First-class schools,
 sleek furniture design,
  energy independence,
  and brooding TV dramas
 about teenagers getting killed.


  Thank you so much for
 renting my apartment.


  It's so efficient.


  Please allow me to give
 you a tour of Copenhagen.


  Wonderful.

 But first, a nap.


  No, Homer.

 You slept on the plane.


  You slept through customs.


 You slept on the bus.


  How can you sleep now?
  Don't you hear Copenhagen calling?
  Take a message.


    The people here are
 so openly affectionate.


  Why don't we all hold hands?
  Are we supposed to
 interlock fingers or not?
  Cramp! Cramp!
  Dad's hands are covered with jam.


  - I can't get it off!
 - Grampa's hands are too rough.


  - Lisa's hands are too soft.


 - Just keep holding.


  Oh, don't worry, the
 government will pay you
  to learn this social skill.


  Uh, Homer, you are
 holding your own hand.


  They're fighting over a Danish.


  SOREN: Created in 1913,
 The Little Mermaid
  is a world-famous icon of Denmark.


  No, The Little Mermaid
 was created by Disney,
  right before he created
 Spider-Man and Star Wars.


  This is the real little mermaid.


  And she was a very tragic figure.


  - What about her buddy, the crab?
 - There was no crab!
  He was the only funny thing in it.


  Got that right.


  Oh, my God, it's wonderful.


  More people biking than driving cars.


  Yes, it's rush hour,
  so people are taking the
 bicycle superhighways home.


  Uh, how crowded are your
 bicycle superhighways?
  [CHUCKLES]: Well
  We don't have any.


  But how many people
 ride bikes in your town?
  The paperboy, till Dad hit him.


  Sadly, the one headline
 he couldn't deliver.


  Wait a minute, wait a
 minute, stop the car!
  [HOMER AND BART LAUGH]
   What? It's Danish for "speed check.

"
  - Fart kontrol.


 - [HOMER AND BART LAUGHING]
  [BLOWS RASPBERRIES]
  [GIGGLES]
  I apologize for my husband.


  In our language, that sign
 means something else.


  Yes, I know.


  I'm speaking to you in your language.


    "Non-Danes do not qualify
 for the free health care.


  "But if you injure yourself in Denmark,
  a Danish hospital will
 treat you for free.

"
  [CHUCKLES] I can't believe
 the government puts this out.


  For free!
  [HOMER AND GRAMPA LAUGH]
  Excuse me, you dropped this.


  Lisa, this is Prince Christian,
 second in line to the throne.


    I play the tenor sax.


  Oh, no, here it comes.


  The fantasy about becoming a princess
  that no girl can resist.


    [TRUMPETS PLAYING FANFARE]
  [DRAMATIC SOUNDTRACK MUSIC PLAYING]
  Bart, get out of my fantasy!
  Ah, geez, I saved your life.


 How about a "you're welcome"?
    Can you imagine how exciting it would be
  to live in this city?
  Ooh, Mom, we could try
 it for a semester.


  Do you know how long I've wanted
 to live in a Celsius country?
  There's boobs on the billboards!
  And we're here in the world's
 most perfect amusement park.


  [FIREWORKS WHISTLING, POPPING]

  [CHOIR SINGING IN DANISH]
  Their national anthem is so beautiful,
  and they don't get to war

  And it's in a range
 you can actually sing.


  There is a lovely land 
  With spreading shady beech-trees 
  Near salty eastern shore 
  Near salty eastern shore.

 
    Bart and Lisa are getting along!
 This country is calling to us.


  Homer, can you take the daring step
  of doing nothing and staying here?
  There are big reasons
 why we can't live here.


  I'm okay with nuclear
 power, but wind power?
  - Frankly, it sounds dangerous.


 - Excuse me, white trash.


  Is this the kind of country
 you want to live in?
  No, sir.

 I meant we separate
 our trash by colors.


  This country is still lovely 
  Because blue is the lake wind 
  I can't believe you're talking
 about leaving Springfield.


  That's where all my friends are.


  Look, everyone, we came here
 to rip this country off,
  and that's what we're gonna do
 and then go home.


  Fine.

 Let's find a place
 that has good smorrebrod,
  or maybe some morbradbof or flaeskesteg.


  Women do love this country.


  Homer, do you think I'm handsome?
  Well, yes.

 I was gonna mention it.


  - I am a Danish four.


 - I'm an American nine.


  ["AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL" PLAYING]
  How could my family want to stay here?
  In America, we have great
 TV channels, like BBC America,
  and a factory for cheesecakes
 a factory!
  Your enthusiasm makes me
 want to follow you there.


  Foreigners are no longer welcome.


  All right, Dad, no more fooling around.


  Time to get you in the hospital,
 so we can go home.


               Hello.

 How was your day?
  Eh.

 This country sure is safe.


  Well, last week, an older tourist
  had a bad fall at Kronborg Castle.


  Of course, Kronborg Castle.


 Why didn't I think of it?
  Probably because I never heard of it.


  TOUR GUIDE: Dating back
 to the 15th century,
  Kronborg was immortalized as Elsinore
  in Shakespeare's Hamlet.


  Isn't it beautiful?
  Yeah, the castle's okay,
 but the keep is, like, meh.


  And I'll tell you something else
 great about here.


  You've been walking so much,
 you've lost weight.


  [GASPS] I'm down to
 my pre-pregnancy weight!
  Homer, in this most beautiful
 spot on Earth,
  I have to admit to you,
 I really don't want to go home.


  - I don't either.


 - Let's stay.


  Think about how happy we'd be here.


  It's healthy, it's clean,
 it's incredibly civilized,
  and everything is done in moderation.


  You're not describing a country.


  You're describing everything
 that's the opposite of me.


  Everyone here speaks perfect English.


  Probably gonna be around in five years.


  It's just a nice place and we like it.


  All I ask is that you think about it.


  Maybe she's right.


 Maybe we should move here.


  Tubby or not tubby,
 that is the question.


  Whether 'tis nobler in the mind
  to gobble the wings and nachos
 of outrageous portions,
  or just eat fish and end them.


  Ay, there's the rub
 brisket rub, Memphis rub.


  Oh, the rubs I'll miss when I
 have shuffled off from Buffalo.


  Mozzarella No.


  I'm an American, and we've got
 to get back to America,
  the greatest country on Earth,
 1917 to 2016.


  This is the famous Holger
 Danish, our sleeping king.


  All right, Dad, here we go.


  There's nothing more American
 than a slip and fall.


  - [GRUNTS]
 - Whoa!
  Hold on, son.


  Before you push me down these
 stairs, I have a confession.


  The procedure I need isn't a surgery.


  I just need to remove an old tattoo.


  You made us come here
 because of a stupid tattoo?
  It's not just any tattoo.


    [GASPS] Mom?
  No! Mona Malloy,
 who used to iron my shirts.


  Of course it's your mother.


    I can't go to my grave
 with this hanging over my heart.


  Why is it guys like us
  are always disappointing
 the women we love?
  I would ask Mona, but she's
 spending eternity hating me,
  from her pit in hell.


  I miss her, too.


  Her greatest skill was
 making people miss her.


  [SOBBING]
  - Hello.


 - She's talking to you.


  Mm, I'll talk to someone my age.


  [CHUCKLES]
   Excuse me.

 I felt compelled to meet you.


  I've never met a man
 with empathy so deep
  he weeps in public.


  Oh, yeah, I cry, I blubber.


  Sometimes stuff comes out of my nose.


  Well [SIGHS]
  Danish men never reveal such emotion.


  They're like cold, flawless gods.


  Look, lady, I'm a married man.


  - I'm a married man.


 - Shh.


  [MUFFLED]: I'm a married man.


  Here, marriage is not
 such a sacred institution.


  Danes are very free sexually.


  Perhaps it's because we are more
 sensitive to each other's needs,
  or just because
 we're all so freaking hot.


  Now let us dance our
 traditional dance of passion.


  Okay.


  - [LIVELY DANISH MUSIC PLAYING]
 - [EXCITED SHOUTING]
  Do you know the Danes eat more
 ice cream than any other people?
  Yet their rate of heart disease is
  Oh, it's their number one
 cause of death.


  Well, look where we got it.


  Well, that never stopped your father.


  I'll just text a picture of you
 right now, eating the ice
  Oh, my God.


  [GASPS] Marge.


  Where are you going?
  Where will I ever find
 another man like you?
  Hi, we're the Kiwanis Club
 of Cheeseburg, Ohio.


  [SIGHS]: Oh hio.


  I must confess to you now,
  every couple that has Airbnb'd
 my apartment has broken up.


  Then how did it get
 so many good reviews?
  They like the big apartment cat.


  Oh, I do like it.


 Ooh, let me scratch your chin!
  [PURRING]
  He's so chubby, I just can't take it!
  Marge, honey, I'm so sorry.


  We shared a dance and a fish,
 but that's it.


  - I understand.

 It's fine.


 - So you're coming home?
  No, I'm not.

 I want to stay.


  I don't know for how long,
 but I feel so alive and free.


  I've stopped wearing a bra.


  [GASPS] That means
 they're just one fabric away
  from the cool Scandinavian air.


  Sorry, Homie.

 We're not leaving.


  Well, the kids can't just replace me.


  He's so cozy.

 He can sleep with Mom.


  Can I get you a beer?
  [PURRING]
  [HOMER GROANS]
  - Dad, wait.


 - [GASPS]
  Mom says you can take these home
 with you.

 It's a bag of bras.


  And I just learned how to unhook these.


  Oh, my God.

 What am I doing?
  I should be having the time of my life
  in this airport security line,
 but it's nothing without Marge.


  Son, I got to tell you something.


  - You're making a huge mistake.


 - I know.


  I let stubbornness ruin my marriage,
  and all I have to show for it
 is an old tattoo.


  - Go back to your woman.


 - You mean the one in the bar?
  First the one in the bar, then Marge.


  No! Just Marge.


    - Marge!
 - [GASPS] You missed the flight.


  Marge, baby, wherever you are is home.


  I'm staying in Copenhagen.


  I'm glad you came back,
  but I was kind of rethinking
 living here.


  Why?
  The toilet's in the shower.


  The washing machine won't even hold
  one pair of your underpants.


  And you see how dark it is?
  It's 11:00 in the morning.


  [YAWNS]
  Well, that was a nice day.


  I think I'm ready to go home.


  You got it, baby.


  We'll ditch this paradise
 and never come back.


  What about the kids?
  I heard the schools are
 really great here.

 I'm out.


  I want to stay,
 but no one ever listens to me.


  So we're all united.


  - Yay!
 - Whoo!
  But I can't help thinking
 I'm forgetting something.


  Sir, those birds were
 already fed by the state.


  You are overfeeding them,
 which will kill them.


  [GRAMPA GRUNTS]
  When life gives you lemons,
 you make lemonade.


  ALL: Aw.

 
  So how much do we owe you?
  Nothing.

 In Denmark,
 we have socialized tattooing.


  And with that, our country
 is out of money.

 Good-bye.

  Oh, hey, Bart.

 What you doing?
  They say this one single test
  can tell if you're a genius or not.


  Huh.

 Looks pretty simple to me.


  It says only one out of every 400 people
  has the "spatial reasoning"
 to solve this maze.


  Elon Musk and Angela Merkel
 both got perfect scores.

 Angela.


  Oh, if you're so smart,
 let's see you solve the maze.

  Okay, fine.

 No board games.


  HOMER: Dumb.

 Useless.


  Piece missing.


  So flammable.


  Okay, look, the TV still works,
  and I know we've seen
 all our DVDs a hundred times,
  so this could be
 the perfect time to break out

  Classic moments from a time

  "Family Matters"?
  It certainly does.


  "The Tracey Ullman Show"?

  "Saved by the Bell"?

 that launched no one's career.

 of hooking up the VCR.


  Okay, I need to connect magenta

  Marge, did I record these
 in long play or extended play?

  Are you into God now? I always was.


  Look at those abs.


  The secret is less loaves, more fishes.


  I don't believe in some dopey religion.


  This is to keep out ghosts.


  Oh, this looks just like
 my first apartment with Ned.


  I'm never leaving!
  Milhouse, have you ever been haunted?
  Once, my hamster died
 and then came back.


  Actually, my parents bought a new one
  and thought I wouldn't know.


  Then my dad's check bounced,
 and they repo'd the hamster.


  You've got to talk to me, Bart.


  Leave me alone.

 Leave me alone!
  The power of Homer's socks compels you!
  [MAUDE SCREAMS]
  Maybe you could use this, my therapist.


  If you see him, can you give him this?
  Don't tell him
 I forgot to bring it back.


  He'll say I kept it to get attention.


  I don't need attention, Dr.

 Sam!
  I knew it was Milhouse.

 I knew it!
  What's on your mind, son?
  I'm scared to say.


 You'll toss me in the loony bin.


  [CHUCKLES] Bart, these days,
 there are no more loony bins.


  All those people are on the streets.


  - So how can I help you?
 - I've been talking to a ghost.


  I know, you think I'm
 the nuttiest kid you've seen.


  Oh, please, I can't tell you
 what a relief it is
  to not be talking to Milhouse.


  Are you allowed to say stuff like that?

  Why would you kill yourself?
  Oh, I want my patients to think
 it's all their fault.

  Oh, if you'd been on time,
 you might've saved my life,
  but, you know, whatever.


  [GROANS] Why is this happening to me?
  I don't know, but you have a gift!
  You can see the dead, Bart.


  Why am I waiting for a bus?
  I can appear and disappear
 whenever I want.


  And it's late.


  Eh, that's far enough.


  And, Bart, you can
 help us ghosts move on to
  what comes next.


  By telling your family you love them?
  Uh, which family?
 I've led a complicated life.


  No, to move on, I need you
 to get revenge on Dr.

  with whom I share the office.


  What have you got against him?
  He won't shut up about his Tesla.


  Yes, yes, just as smart
 as I always thought I

 Now I can move on.


  Uh-oh.


  Wow, helping him felt really good.


  - Help us, Bart.


 - Help us.


  Settle our beefs.


  Beefs!
  Please help me get vengeance
 against all jet engines 
  And then I will go to hell.

 
  Didn't anybody finish
 their business before dying?
  All I want to do is return this hatchet.


  [SIGHS] Fine.


  Okay, I want you

  Who would've figured he'd rat me out?
  Ow!
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

 Next.


  You can't keep ignoring me!
  [BART GROANING]
  Um, Doctor, shouldn't he have
 woken up by now?
  Yes, he should.


  Unless someone's been
 telling him bad things.


  - What do you mean?
 - Anything negative someone says
  could do permanent damage
 to his brain function.


  It could even kill him.


  But you said he'd be fine!
  I said he'd be fine if you told him
  he was at a dolphin encounter on Maui.


  But those dolphins aren't fine!
 They try to kill themselves!
  I said he'd be fine, not the dolphins.


  Oh.

 Oh, no.

 Oh.


  Bart! Bart.

 I'm sorry.


  I'm so sorry.


 I'll watch everything I say.


  [GROANS] I had to walk
 nine blocks to get this.


  - I am dead.

 - Nine blocks.


  I am dead.


  Dead, dead.

 Dead, dead, dead.

 Hey, T-shirt, T-shirt, T-shirt!
  Fire!
  Ooh, a bobby pin!
  [SCREAMS]
  - [BODY THUDS]
 - [GASPS]
  You mean the guy
 who invented the T-shirt guns?
  - No.


 - The guys who built the stadium
  - with a really low back wall?
 - No.


  You, for standing up?
  No, your father,
 your stupid, stupid father!
  You know, some people grow
 when they die.

 Not you.


  See you, guys.


  That was fun, getting every
 answer in Jeopardy! wrong.


  Hmm, all that saying good-bye
 really made me thirsty.


  Mmm.

 Hmm?
  NELSON: Maude Flanders says hello.


  Hello.

 [GRUNTING]
  Let's move!
  Oh, thank you, Bart.


 I'm finally at peace.


  You know, Ned remarried.


  He what?!
  [SIGHS] Well, that's it.


 All the ghosts have been helped.


  Except one.


  Dad, you weren't supposed to die.


  It was, it was just
 supposed to scare you.


  Oh, don't worry.


  Patricide is just a part of life.


  Ooh, your vocabulary
 really goes up when you die.


  - Dad, I'm so sorry I killed you.


 - It's cool, I feel no pain.


  [SHOUTS]
  Ooh, I was wrong.


  It feels worse than in life.


  Get away, you stupid cat!
  - [GRUNTS] D'oh!
 - [CAT YOWLS]
  Oh, I can't believe you're dead.


  But at least I can still see you,
  while I help you
 with your unfinished business.


  Well, I wanted to lose some weight,
  but I'm light as a feather now.


  All that's left is for me
 to go into the light.


  [HEAVENLY CHOIR SINGING]
  You know how much you hate walking.


  Stay with me.


  Stay with me, Bart.

 Stay with me.


  Oh, Homie.

 It's not your fault.


  You were doomed when
 they started putting cheese
  into pizza crust.


  What's next, plugging
 Swiss cheese with cookie dough?
  Peanut butter and hot dogs?
  Why isn't anyone
 writing these things down?
  [CRYING]
  I can't watch this.


 I'm gonna go check in on Moe's.


  I don't know what's wrong.


 I served them lager.


  Uh-oh.


  I should go, son.


  I leave this world without a care,
  knowing I raised two great kids,
 plus the one who murdered me.


  [MONITOR BEEPS RAPIDLY, FLATLINES]
  No, Bart, you have to stay with me!
  [HEAVENLY CHOIR SINGING]
  No, Dad, you have to stay with me!
  No, my time has come.


  Man was not meant to live
 beyond the age of 39.


  You have to stay.


  If you leave,
 Mom will marry someone else.


  I want her to be happy.


  And someone else will raise your kids!
  [LAUGHS] Sucker.


  And someone else will ride your mower.


  That bastard!
  Still, it's time for me to move on.


  Oh, my God.

 It's so beautiful!
  [BART GASPING]
  [GLASS SHATTERS]
  [SCREAMING]
  [LAUGHS]: Dad!
  Why you little life-saving,
 heaven can waiting!
  Bart, I'm so sorry
 if I was ever mean to you,
  because even though
 you started it, you
  Sorry, sorry, I'm past that.


  [CRYING]
  I love you, and I want you back,
 Bart Simpson.


  [CRYING]
  BART [WEAKLY]: Lisa?
  Ah! He's awake!
  - Thank God.


 - Lisa?
  Have you been by my side
 this whole time?
  I have.


  Were you putting
 those bad dreams in my head?
  Yes.


  - Can you teach me how to do it?
 - I guess.


  And can you help me put Dad in a coma?
  No.


  [CHEWING, MOANING]
  Oh, man, this is great.


  But how do I know
 this isn't a dream, too?
  Because you're not wearing the sweater.


  Oh, yeah, of course.


  Wait a minute.


  How did he know about the sweater?
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]
  Bart, did you see anything else
 when you were under?
  Just how we're all gonna die.


  - Want me to tell you?
 - Not really.


  Well, I'm gonna tell you anyway.


  Ouch 
  I have lost myself again 
  Lost myself and I am nowhere 
  I knew it was a sandwich.


  Yeah 
  [COUGHING]
  [GROANS]
  Lost myself again 
  And I feel unsafe 
  Be my friend 
  Hold me 
  Wrap me up 
  Unfold me 
  [LAUGHS]
  I am small 
  I'm needy 
  Oh, my God!
  Now I realize, this has
 all been a waste of time.


  And breathe me 
  Be my friend 
  Hold me, wrap me up 
  Now I'm the evil king.


  Unfold me 
  I am small 
  I'm needy 
  Warm me up 
  And breathe me.
